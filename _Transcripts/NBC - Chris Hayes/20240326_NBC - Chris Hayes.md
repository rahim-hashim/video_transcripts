Video Description: “It is worth remembering just how this case got before the highest court in the land in the first place—because the entire undertaking is, in my view, a ludicrous insult to the entire judicial system,” says Chris Hayes on the right-wing scheme to get a case challenging abortion pill access in front of the Supreme Court.

# This case is ‘a ludicrous insult to the entire judicial system,’ says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U)
*  Today, the Supreme Court of the United States of America heard oral arguments in the case [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=0.0s)]
*  to ban the drug methampristone, which blocks the hormone progesterone. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=4.22s)]
*  And for decades, it's been one of the safest and most commonly used abortion pills. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=7.76s)]
*  Medication abortions make up the majority of all abortions in America. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=13.76s)]
*  Banning methampristone would be a disaster for vital health care in this country coast [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=17.98s)]
*  to coast, red states and blue. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  Fortunately for now, it looks like the arguments against the drug were so transparently ridiculous [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=24.48s)]
*  that even this Supreme Court was not buying it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=28.9s)]
*  I'm going to get that into a moment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=31.22s)]
*  But first, it is worth remembering just how this case got before the highest court in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=33.3s)]
*  the land in the first place, something that the vast majority of cases never do. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=36.98s)]
*  Because the entire undertaking is, in my view, a ludicrous insult to the entire judicial [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=41.66s)]
*  system. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=46.42s)]
*  So here's how it happened. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=47.42s)]
*  Back in August of 2022, that's just about a month after the Supreme Court overturned [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=49.14s)]
*  Roe v. Wade, a brand new entity called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine was incorporated [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=53.3s)]
*  in the city of Amarillo, Texas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  The Alliance is comprised of five anti-abortion groups, none of which are based in Texas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=60.62s)]
*  You may be wondering why a handful of out-of-state groups opposing abortion decided to form their [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=65.7s)]
*  new shell group in a relatively nondescript Texas town along Route 66. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=70.38s)]
*  And it's because at the time, Amarillo, Texas functioned as something of a legal loophole [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=76.02s)]
*  for right-wing causes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=81.1s)]
*  Due to a quirk in how the U.S. court system worked until just a few weeks ago, all federal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=83.14s)]
*  suits filed in this relatively small Texas town would fall before the same judge, a guy [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=88.14s)]
*  named Matthew Kesmerick. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=94.98s)]
*  Kesmerick first made his name as an activist for far-right religious causes, decrying everything [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=97.14s)]
*  from divorce laws to transgender rights and gay marriage and, yes, of course, abortion [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=101.86s)]
*  rights. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=107.66s)]
*  In fact, in a 2017 entry Kesmerick submitted to a conservative legal journal, he wrote [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=108.66s)]
*  about the need to protect religious medical providers who, in his view, quote, cannot [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=112.94s)]
*  use their pens to prescribe or dispense abortifacient drugs designed to kill unborn children. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=116.7s)]
*  Notably not long after Kesmerick submitted that article, he actually had asked to have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=124.38s)]
*  his name taken off of it, citing, quote, reasons I may discuss at a later date. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=128.22s)]
*  Those reasons became abundantly clear when it was announced that Donald Trump was appointing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=133.66s)]
*  that Matthew Kesmerick to the federal bench. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=137.46s)]
*  And after years of back and forth with the Senate, he was finally confirmed in 2019. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=140.1s)]
*  And then, if you wanted to get your case before this extreme right-wing Trump judge, whose [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=144.54s)]
*  views on this stuff were obvious and clear as day, all you had to do was get a ticket [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=149.98s)]
*  to Amarillo, Texas and figure out a way to file your case there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  But even then, you still need to at least pretend to follow the rules of the American [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=160.62s)]
*  legal system, the most fundamental of which is the concept of standing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=165.06s)]
*  Before you file a lawsuit, you need to show that you, who are filing the suit, represent [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=170.2s)]
*  someone who is actually being harmed by whatever law or rule you are challenging. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=175.04s)]
*  Here's where things got a little tricky for that group, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=180.56s)]
*  They wanted to ban methamphetrystone as an ideological project, but the drug has been [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=184.61999999999998s)]
*  used safely for 20 years. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't like it was people who'd been harmed by the drug that we're suing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=189.64s)]
*  No one was actually harmed by it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  So they got a little creative with their legal reasoning. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=194.12s)]
*  And here's what they came up with. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=196.64s)]
*  The abortion pill can sometimes give doctors the sads. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=199.04s)]
*  No, seriously, they argued, in part, quote, when there are patients of chemical abortions, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=202.28s)]
*  doctors lose the opportunity to provide professional services and care for the women and child [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=207.56s)]
*  through pregnancy, which causes harms to providers who no longer can care for their patients [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=213.28s)]
*  and bring about a successful delivery of new life. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  This would be like saying oncologists were being harmed by smoking cessation efforts [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=223.16s)]
*  because they like doing oncology on people with lung cancer. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  And if there's less people with lung cancer, then they're deprived of the joy of helping [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=233.12s)]
*  people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=236.96s)]
*  They're arguing that providing abortion pills harms the doctors because they don't get to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=239.54s)]
*  deliver more cute babies, and that makes them sad. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=244.04s)]
*  This is the argument. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=248.46s)]
*  It is, to put it lightly, a ridiculous argument. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=249.74s)]
*  But Judge Kazmeric is not a serious jurist. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=252.38s)]
*  He's a hack. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=254.78s)]
*  So to no one's surprise, he ruled in favor of the anti-abortion front group and issued [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=257.12s)]
*  a nationwide injunction in all 50 states of Memphis-Bristone blocking access to it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=261.38s)]
*  Now that decision was stopped by the appellant court, and it snaked its way all the way up [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=267.7s)]
*  to the Supreme Court, who heard oral arguments today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=272.02s)]
*  And I got to say, even with a court with the same ideological makeup as the one that overturned [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=275.84s)]
*  wrote, same court, except for Katanji Brown Jackson, they seem pretty skeptical of the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=279.64s)]
*  anti-abortion pill argument. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=284.82s)]
*  Is it the first time? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=287.82s)]
*  Is it the only time? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=288.82s)]
*  Any court has restricted access to an FDA-approved drug by second-guessing FDA's expert judgment [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=290.38s)]
*  about the conditions required to assure that drug's safe use. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=296.18s)]
*  Under federal law, no doctors can be forced against their consciences to perform or assist [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=300.34s)]
*  in an abortion, correct? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  Do we have to also entertain your argument that no one else in the world can have this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  drug or no one else in America should have this drug in order to protect your clients? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  In this case, it seems like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule or any other federal government action. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=327.96s)]
*  The difficulty here is that, at least to me, these affidavits do read more, like the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=338.04s)]
*  conscience objection is strictly to actually participating in the abortion to end the life [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  of the embryo or fetus. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  And I don't read either Scott or Francis to say that they ever participated in that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=351.94s)]
*  Of course, now, every justice on the court was quite so skeptical of the anti-mephibrysotan [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  arguments, as ludicrous as they may be. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=360.18s)]
*  And they used today's hearing to try and kind of help anti-abortion activists do their homework. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=362.8s)]
*  Melissa Murray and Ellie Mistal join me on that next. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=367.54s)]
*  Enjoy it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Ku57zT50U&t=397.54s)]
