# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 23
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes, day two of the criminal trial of Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And today we heard in great detail how Trump and his gang conspired to hide all his worst [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=5.0s)]
*  secrets, well at least some of them, while Trump and his lawyer continue to stretch the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  patience of Judge Juan Marchand. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=14.6s)]
*  And the morning started with a hearing on the gag order that Judge had already issued, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=17.04s)]
*  which Trump has repeatedly and flagrantly been violating on social media and elsewhere. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=22.6s)]
*  You will have more on that later in the show, but suffice to say the entire event was a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=27.28s)]
*  huge embarrassment for Trump's attorney, Todd Blanch. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  Like every Trump employee, Blanch, once an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  of New York, was forced to repeatedly debase himself in service of his boss because if [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  you agree to work for Trump, the threshold qualification is to be the kind of person [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=43.56s)]
*  who only cares first and foremost about pleasing him rather than, well, doing your job. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=48.28s)]
*  In fact, in his opening statements on Monday, Blanch went out of his way to let everyone [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=53.68s)]
*  know he was speaking to an audience of one when he insisted on referring to his client, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=57.2s)]
*  criminal defendant, private citizen as President Trump, and then saying, quote, You're going [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  to hear me refer to him as President Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=66.48s)]
*  This is a title he has earned because he was our 45th president. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=68.64s)]
*  We will call him President Trump out of respect for the office he held from 2017 to 2021. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=72.04s)]
*  But as we saw today, as we will likely continue to see, as we've seen in many, many different [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=79.2s)]
*  venues in many different situations, pleasing Donald Trump and doing your job, in this case, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=83.76s)]
*  providing him the best legal representation, often a mutually exclusive choice. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=89.84s)]
*  That theme continued when longtime publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, took [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=95.84s)]
*  the stand again this afternoon for a second day of testimony. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Pecker outlined how while running the National Enquirer, he worked with Trump and Michael [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Cohn to both suppress negative stories about the then presidential candidate and to plant [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=107.8s)]
*  negative and presumably baseless stories about Trump's political opponents. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=114.28s)]
*  Michael Cohn would call me and say, We would like for you to run a negative article on, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=118.92s)]
*  let's say, for argument's sake on Ted Cruz. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=122.88s)]
*  Then he would send me information about Ted Cruz or Ben Carson or about Marco Rubio. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=125.96s)]
*  That was the basis of our story. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=130.72s)]
*  And then we would embellish it from there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=131.72s)]
*  Upon further questioning, Pecker clarified, quote, Michael Cohn wasn't part of the campaign [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=134.67999999999998s)]
*  when he said we, I thought he was talking about himself and Mr. Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  Sounds like Pecker believed that he was acting at the direction of Donald Trump when he published [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  stories like this about Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who challenged Trump in the 2016 primary, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=146.88s)]
*  having extramarital affairs with multiple women. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=152.72s)]
*  Five secret messages, actually. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=156.04s)]
*  Or this story. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=158.64s)]
*  Remember this one? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=159.64s)]
*  There's a little bit of attention which Pecker admitted to making up, linking Cruz's father [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=160.64s)]
*  to the John F. Kennedy assassination. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Remember that one? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=168.44s)]
*  Of course, the substance of this trial is about what the Empire did not publish as part [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  of its practice in the tabloid world known as Catch and Kill, during which it helped [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  suppress stories about Trump's own affairs, culminating in a 2015 meeting between Pecker, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=179.27999999999997s)]
*  Trump and Cohn. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  Tonight, a person familiar with the matter tells NBC News in August 2015, candidate Trump [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=187.27999999999997s)]
*  was in the room when Cohen and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker discussed ways Pecker's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=192.48s)]
*  company AMI could help quash negative stories about Mr. Trump's relationships with women. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  That was from 2018 when that meeting was first reported. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  According to Pecker, in that 2015 meeting in August, he told Trump and Michael Cohn, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  quote, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=213.6s)]
*  Today's testimony ended with something of a cliffhanger as Pecker began to outline the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=232.6s)]
*  plan to pay off Playboy model Karen McDougal to cover up her own story of an affair with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=235.88s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  According to Pecker's testimony, one of his editors approached him in the spring of 2016 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=242.36s)]
*  about McDougal with the understanding that she wanted someone to purchase and bury the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=246.68s)]
*  story of her affair. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=251.08s)]
*  Pecker says he contacted Michael Cohn, who insisted on communicating through an encrypted [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=253.28s)]
*  app. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=257.12s)]
*  Cohn apparently grew increasingly agitated as Pecker's editor worked to vet McDougal's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  story, with Pecker saying, quote, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=263.32s)]
*  Adding, quote, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=268.32s)]
*  Did we hear anything yet? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=273.32s)]
*  Pecker also testified that Trump called him directly about the McDougal story, with the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=275.48s)]
*  then candidate saying, quote, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=279.48s)]
*  Pecker said he told Trump to purchase the McDougal story. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=287.48s)]
*  The former editor will resume his testimony on Thursday. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=290.56s)]
*  We have the day off tomorrow for the trial, but we already know how this story ends. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  The Inquirer paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story and her silence. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=297.24s)]
*  But here's the asterisk, which is great. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=302.72s)]
*  Trump was supposed to repay Pecker. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=305.72s)]
*  Pecker wasn't just doing this as charity. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=307.72s)]
*  He was the pass-through, if you will. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=309.68s)]
*  But Trump did what he always does. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=312.76s)]
*  He stiffed him on the bill, $150,000, which is why Michael Cohn was the one forced to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=313.88s)]
*  pay Stormy Daniels out of his own pocket. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=320.72s)]
*  And that, of course, is why Trump was ultimately in court today. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent who's been watching from inside the courtroom. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  Andrew Rice also in the courtroom today. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  He's a writer at New Yorker Magazine, where he just profiled Trump's defense attorney, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  Todd Blanch, in a new cover story. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  And they join me now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  Great to have you both here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  Let me just start top-line impressions from the day to day, Lisa. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  I think my top-line impression is that David Pecker has a whole lot to say. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  One of the things that he said at the very beginning was he was asked how often he communicated [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=354.0s)]
*  And he said, after Trump became a candidate, their conversations increased, not decreased. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=355.0s)]
*  You would expect a presidential candidate would get so busy that they wouldn't really [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=359.0s)]
*  have time for their old friend David Pecker. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=362.8s)]
*  And yet, they still found time to meet once a month, talked on the phone roughly once [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=365.0s)]
*  a week and sometimes more. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=370.68s)]
*  We heard about two of those conversations today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=372.6s)]
*  Book ended sort of the beginning and the end of the testimony, that August 2015 meeting [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  that you talked about, and that phone call during 2016 about Karen McDougal having been [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=379.24s)]
*  vetted and what Trump wanted to know about that conversation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  I have to assume there are a lot more conversations that David Pecker had directly with Donald [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=388.32s)]
*  Trump and that the prosecution is going to elicit testimony about them in the ensuing [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=392.68s)]
*  days. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=396.92s)]
*  Andrew, what did you think? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=397.92s)]
*  I mean, I thought the most relevant thing to watch was actually sort of the ongoing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=398.92s)]
*  dichotomy between what's going on inside the courtroom and what's happening outside the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=404.24s)]
*  courtroom. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=408.56s)]
*  And I think that it came into relief really when at the beginning of the day when there [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=409.56s)]
*  was a hearing about whether Donald Trump was going to be held in contempt for some of the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=413.8s)]
*  things that he had said on Truth Social about witnesses, even about a juror. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=422.6s)]
*  And Todd Blanch, the guy that I profiled in the story, got up and said that our client [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=424.64s)]
*  has a right to talk about the two systems of justice that are being shown here in this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  courtroom. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think this is something that we're going to see a lot, which is basically Donald [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=436.84s)]
*  Trump is not if he can win an acquittal or if he can win a mistrial, that's great for [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=440.0s)]
*  him. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=444.91999999999996s)]
*  But he's running against the system. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, OK, let me a follow up on that, because Blanch also at one point says to Mershan, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=447.2s)]
*  and we're going to talk about this in a second and more in greater detail, but he says like [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=451.2s)]
*  he's doing his best or something or like we're trying our best. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=454.44s)]
*  And that's when Mershan says like, you're losing credibility. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=457.2s)]
*  Like, come on, buddy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=459.84s)]
*  What is Blanch's angle here? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=461.32s)]
*  If it is the case that your understanding of Trump's approach to this is not primarily [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  is legal, that it's primarily about the sort of making this broader case in the court of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=469.12s)]
*  public opinion, is Blanch on board with that strategy? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=473.32s)]
*  Well, I think that Blanch is ultimately trying to and they've made it very clear they're [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=477.6s)]
*  hoping to find a juror, one juror really, who will hold out and won't vote to convict [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=483.8s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=490.12s)]
*  And they're hoping for a mistrial. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=491.12s)]
*  And if there is a mistrial, of course, Donald Trump will go out on the courtrooms, courthouse [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=493.56s)]
*  steps and say, I've been completely exonerated, even here in New York. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  And so that's that's their strategy. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=502.64s)]
*  Ultimately, the back and forth with the judge, which is happening outside of the presence [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=506.88s)]
*  of the jury, has not bled into the trial too much. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=510.52s)]
*  But it's going to be an interesting dynamic to watch. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  In terms of this, you know, the Pecker testimony and the notion of a mistrial, and one of the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=518.44s)]
*  things that just going back to the transcripts is just sort of striking me again. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=523.36s)]
*  And maybe this is such an obvious point, but just indulge me for a second. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=527.88s)]
*  It's like, you know, sometimes you'll have like in a classic sort of mystery courtroom [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  drama, there's a question of like, was it that person driving the car? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=534.9200000000001s)]
*  Did this actually happen? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  In this case, it's like it's clear as day all this stuff happened. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  It's clear as day. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=544.32s)]
*  Like, is there any real doubt that David Pecker met with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=545.36s)]
*  they set up the catcher? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess you could think that Pecker's lying and that Michael Cohen's lying and that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=551.4000000000001s)]
*  all that. But the basics of the story that's being presented here just seem to me pretty [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=555.44s)]
*  much bedrock solid. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=560.12s)]
*  But let me push back on that a little. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=561.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that one of the things that the prosecution has to establish and was surprising [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=562.84s)]
*  to many people in the courtroom is the extent of Donald Trump's own involvement here, which, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=567.36s)]
*  of course, as the bar here. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=571.6s)]
*  Yes, which is necessary not only contextually, but to prove the crime. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  The other thing is we all know about what I'll call the antecedent story, the setup [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=577.24s)]
*  of the hush money payments. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=582.12s)]
*  The thing that the prosecutors have to really prove, though, to show falsification of business [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  records as a felony is that there was a cover up with the intent to commit or conceal a [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=588.16s)]
*  crime. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=594.12s)]
*  And tying Donald Trump expressly to that, I think is something that none of us have [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=595.12s)]
*  really seen their evidence about yet. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=599.36s)]
*  And we're all looking for it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=602.6s)]
*  Totally. But I guess my point is that on this part of it, right, which is not the criminal [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=604.84s)]
*  part, it's just like, did this arrangement happen? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  It just seems clear that it did happen. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, again, I'm not in the jury, but just from the reporting we have from the testimony [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=613.28s)]
*  from and I also wonder also because I can't quite get it from the transcript from the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=616.88s)]
*  transcript. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=621.76s)]
*  Pecker seems pretty comfortable and forthcoming as a witness. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=622.76s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=625.84s)]
*  I thought that it was, you know, maybe maybe I'm naive, but I but I thought it was pretty [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=626.84s)]
*  shocking to hear him talk with such total frankness. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=631.96s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=636.0s)]
*  That's how it comes on nature of the of the relationship that he had with Donald Trump. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=637.0s)]
*  And he actually quite candidly said on the stand that this was not normal. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  This wasn't this what even by the standards of the National Enquirer, these transactions [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=646.64s)]
*  were not normal. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  They had a very special relationship with Donald Trump that they had forged and they [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=652.04s)]
*  wanted to see Donald Trump elected president and they were acting sort of as an adjunct [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  arm of the campaign. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=663.56s)]
*  And that I mean, this is has nothing to do with the criminal child per se, but just as [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  disclosures go. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  The part about the seeding negative stories like he would just send us stuff and we like [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=671.0799999999999s)]
*  That is shocking and would be in any other league media enterprise an unbelievable scandal [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=676.96s)]
*  and also gives you a little sense of how Donald Trump projects his view of the media, like [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=683.04s)]
*  his view of the media being like they all function like that because that's what the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=687.92s)]
*  Enquirer did for me. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=692.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=693.36s)]
*  I think the other thing that sort of was lost until today is what is David Pecker getting [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=694.36s)]
*  out of this? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=698.28s)]
*  And in complimenting and praising Donald Trump, that's what made his testimony so damning. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=699.28s)]
*  He said he was the top celebrity among Enquirer readers, that he was knowledgeable about his [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=703.6s)]
*  business, that he was detail oriented, micromanagerial. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=708.48s)]
*  All the things that he said about Donald Trump that were complimentary are eventually going [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=713.32s)]
*  to be his doom as Pecker tells his story. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=718.28s)]
*  And also there's a little bit of a time machine thing about going back to The Apprentice as [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=721.32s)]
*  a hit show and like I'm trying to sell magazines, man, and this guy's got a big show and he [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  moves product. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=729.48s)]
*  So we need to be close to him. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=730.48s)]
*  Lisa Rubin and Andrew Rice. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=731.84s)]
*  That was great. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=733.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=734.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4pU8yKQ8sQ&t=735.24s)]
