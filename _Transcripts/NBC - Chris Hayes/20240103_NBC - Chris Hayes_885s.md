# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 2
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4)
*  Joining me now is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who sits on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=0.0s)]
*  Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=4.76s)]
*  Thank you so much, Senator, for starting us off tonight on All-In. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=5.76s)]
*  I have to start with this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=10.48s)]
*  What is just your first reaction to that schedule I laid out? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I know people wait for the NFL release and Major League Baseball releases, but I mean, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=16.32s)]
*  seeing all of these trial dates laid out, how do you think that's going to affect the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=20.92s)]
*  ability for Americans to even concentrate on an election when one of the major party [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=27.5s)]
*  candidates is very likely going to be walking in and out of court for most of the summer? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=32.14s)]
*  Well, I hope it sticks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=37.02s)]
*  This is a real challenge for rule of law in the United States of America. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=39.06s)]
*  And rule of law shouldn't evaporate simply because a lot of voters decided to build a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=44.78s)]
*  cult around a criminal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=51.94s)]
*  That doesn't trump rule of law. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  So every single one of these, the criminal cases, the fraud case, the defamation case, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=56.54s)]
*  the separate related case about his immunity, Trump's immunity, all of that sets a really [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=65.86s)]
*  important set of historic questions for this country to answer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  And many of them are going to end up in front of a very magaized Supreme Court. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=77.58s)]
*  Senator, you know, one of the things, Senator, in that recent legal filing by special counsel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=82.7s)]
*  Jack Smith, I cited this a moment ago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=88.78s)]
*  His prosecutors go on to say this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=90.94s)]
*  I want to just read you this quote, get your thoughts on the other side. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=92.58s)]
*  Quote, the defendant asserts that this prosecution threatens to shatter the very bedrock of our [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=94.94s)]
*  republic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=101.14s)]
*  To the contrary is the defendants claim that he cannot be held to answer for the charges [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=101.7s)]
*  that he engaged in an unprecedented effort to retain power through criminal means despite [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=107.06s)]
*  having lost the election. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=111.34s)]
*  That threatens the democratic and constitutional foundation of our republic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=112.78s)]
*  That's about as clear a message as we've seen from Smith's office. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=116.42s)]
*  You know, we're laying out, we know that Trump is a unique threat to American democracy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=120.78s)]
*  What do you think our government needs to do to make that clear to large amounts of American [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=125.94s)]
*  people who maybe don't see how dangerous former President Trump is, or perhaps even some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=131.5s)]
*  Republicans who for some reason seem less convinced of his danger today than they were two [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=136.74s)]
*  years ago? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=140.94s)]
*  Well, I think one thing is to have some confidence in the legal institutions of our country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, when a Dominion was getting harassed and brutalized by the biggest megaphone on the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=149.22s)]
*  planet, the Fox News Organization in an honest courtroom, they forced Fox to shut up and to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  write them an enormous check. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=164.06s)]
*  When the moms from Sandy Hook had to put up with this Infowars character pretending that their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=165.82s)]
*  children hadn't been killed and the whole thing was a scam, there was no way that they could [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=173.54s)]
*  stop his bullying and his noise until they got him into an honest courtroom. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=177.98s)]
*  And suddenly he has to write them enormous checks and shut up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=182.14s)]
*  And so and of course, Gene Carroll is another example of somebody who is going to be a victim [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=185.58s)]
*  of bullying until she got into an honest courtroom. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=190.18s)]
*  So I think we can have some confidence that honest courtrooms can remedy some of the bullying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=193.34s)]
*  and the lies that is now endemic within our political system. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=198.1s)]
*  But at the end of the day, that gets you to a Supreme Court that has to be willing to follow [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=202.78s)]
*  the rule of law and not be subservient to political interests. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=206.38s)]
*  Senator, with that in mind, the court, Chief Justice Roberts, just quietly released their end [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=212.18s)]
*  of year report. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=217.17999999999998s)]
*  Magically, it doesn't seem to talk too much about ethics or the massive, massive, massive [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  ethical lapses that we've seen brought forth by ProPublica and other outlets this year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  What can this government do? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=230.77999999999997s)]
*  What can the Democrats do? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=232.5s)]
*  What can President Biden do? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=233.98s)]
*  What should be done now to allow the American people to believe in the court again? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=235.33999999999997s)]
*  Because it is clearly a compromised institution, but will play a really critical role in the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  defense, hopefully, of our democracy over the next eight to ten months. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=244.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting dilemma, because on the one hand, the public isn't going to really [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  understand what's going on at the Supreme Court until our investigation is complete. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=254.22s)]
*  You know, thanks to ProPublica and The New York Times and many people in your line of work, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=258.54s)]
*  the word about the scandals at the Supreme Court has come out that the Republicans are [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=263.86s)]
*  determined to blockade our efforts to investigate it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=269.06s)]
*  We're equally determined to make sure we get to the bottom of it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=273.14s)]
*  And getting those facts out there is going to be vital for the long term credibility of the court. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=276.54s)]
*  You have to get to solid wood before you start rebuilding, as any carpenter knows. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=282.06s)]
*  And at the same time, this challenged court has to go ahead and continue to be a court and continue [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=288.02s)]
*  to decide cases. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=293.34s)]
*  And I think they need to make sure that they're deciding these cases for real, following real [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=294.74s)]
*  rule of law, respecting precedent and not turning into the captured court that many feel they have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=300.5s)]
*  become. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=307.78s)]
*  Senator, I always think this is really important. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=310.46s)]
*  We're coming up on the three year anniversary of January 6th. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  We're an unruly mob of terrorists, I believe, under the guidance and being promoted by the former [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=316.58s)]
*  president of the United States, attack the Capitol and threaten everybody's lives. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=323.06s)]
*  I'm not saying this for fictional purposes, but because I want the public to understand how dire [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=326.62s)]
*  and important these cases are. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  What do you think would have happened to our U.S. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=333.98s)]
*  Congress? What would have happened to Mike Pence or Joe Biden if Donald Trump had been successful in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=336.66s)]
*  January 6th? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=341.3s)]
*  Well, clearly, paying Mike Pence was the chant that was echoing through the hallways of Congress. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=344.26s)]
*  And men armed with weapons of a whole variety of kinds, including sharpened poles, were smashing [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=353.46s)]
*  things and creating damage. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=364.54s)]
*  Many, many, many Capitol police officers and responding D.C. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=368.46s)]
*  police officers were hurt. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=373.06s)]
*  Several deaths resulted. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=374.98s)]
*  And their purpose was to undo the transfer of power. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=377.42s)]
*  Their purpose was to prevent American democracy from working. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=381.5s)]
*  So the idea that Trump is now defending himself as a champion of democracy and that these [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=387.1s)]
*  prosecutions shouldn't go forward for his effort to destroy democracy because he wants to be back on [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=391.86s)]
*  the ballot again. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=398.5s)]
*  There's a terrible irony behind all of that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=400.1s)]
*  We are less than two weeks away from the Iowa caucuses and three weeks from New Hampshire [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=404.54s)]
*  primaries, which together kick off the 2024 presidential cycle in earnest. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=409.54s)]
*  New polling shows Nikki Haley on the rise, breaking into double digits nationally and rocketing up in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=414.86s)]
*  New Hampshire. You can see the pink line jumping within striking distance of Donald Trump, clearly an alarming [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=419.94s)]
*  development for Trump's camp. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=425.94s)]
*  The ex-president has taken to insulting Haley, calling her bird brain. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=427.82000000000005s)]
*  Haley is taking shots at DeSantis and Chris Christie is pretty much going after everybody. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=432.66s)]
*  Nikki Haley promised. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=437.82s)]
*  I will not, not now, not ever support raising the gas tanks. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=439.46s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=445.18s)]
*  Not now, not ever? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=446.14s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is lying because he's losing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=448.26s)]
*  DeSantis called China Florida's most important trading partner. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=451.06s)]
*  DeSantis even allowed a Chinese military contractor to expand just miles from a U.S. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=455.02s)]
*  naval base. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=461.21999999999997s)]
*  Naval base, only Ron DeSantis. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=462.1s)]
*  Too lame to leave, too weak to win. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=464.66s)]
*  He caused a riot on Capitol Hill. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=467.5s)]
*  He'll burn America to the ground to help himself. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=469.02000000000004s)]
*  Every Republican leader says that in private. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=472.22s)]
*  I'm the only one saying it in public. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=475.1s)]
*  What kind of president do we want? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=477.58000000000004s)]
*  A liar or someone who's got the guts to tell the truth? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  New Hampshire, it's up to you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=482.54s)]
*  Brendan Buck is a Republican strategist who served as press secretary of vice presidential [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=484.22s)]
*  nominee Paul Ryan in 2012. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=488.66s)]
*  Jennifer Horn is the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=490.98s)]
*  They join me now. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=494.18s)]
*  I'll start with you, Brendan. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=497.86s)]
*  This is what's interesting to me when I'm looking at these numbers. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=499.66s)]
*  I see Nikki Haley improving. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=503.90000000000003s)]
*  I see Chris Christie continuing to take shots at everybody. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=505.98s)]
*  I see Ron DeSantis sort of fading. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=509.58000000000004s)]
*  I see the president of the United States. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=511.42s)]
*  I see Ron DeSantis sort of fading. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=513.22s)]
*  Is all of this just sort of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=515.34s)]
*  Is there any chance, not just that somebody beats Donald Trump for the nomination, do [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=519.34s)]
*  you think there's any chance that he doesn't just sweep all the primaries? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very good bet that he's going to sweep all the primaries. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=529.5s)]
*  I'll let Jennifer talk to talk about New Hampshire, but it is notable that Nikki Haley is close. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=532.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that is the closest we've seen anybody. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=537.7s)]
*  Now, is that enough to win? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=541.1s)]
*  I do think that it is. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=542.14s)]
*  We need to remember that Nikki Haley's rise here has gone with Donald Trump largely [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=543.38s)]
*  ignoring her. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=548.86s)]
*  And it seems that he's no longer going to be doing that. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=550.22s)]
*  And I think we need to appreciate that Donald Trump is more than capable of knocking out [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=552.82s)]
*  Nikki Haley in the same way that he did to Ron DeSantis. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=557.02s)]
*  I mean, Ron DeSantis was pretty close, if not ahead of Donald Trump in some polls at [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=560.26s)]
*  the beginning of this year. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=565.74s)]
*  And his slip was two things. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=567.14s)]
*  One, it was just he proved to be a bad candidate. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=569.34s)]
*  But the second was Donald Trump came out pummeling Ron DeSantis and DeSantis didn't know how [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=571.66s)]
*  to respond. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=575.58s)]
*  So if Donald Trump turns on Nikki Haley now and really starts taking shots at her, I [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=576.42s)]
*  think he'll be able to very easily clear that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=580.94s)]
*  And this primary will be over very, very quickly. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=582.74s)]
*  Jennifer, I have to ask you, as former head of the party, New Hampshire, sometimes New [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=586.7s)]
*  Hampshire voters, they like to be contrarian. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=591.3s)]
*  Sometimes they see what happens in Iowa and they're like, well, you know what, I want [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=594.46s)]
*  to do something different just to keep this spicy and interesting. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=597.9s)]
*  Do you think that that is a possibility? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=601.5s)]
*  Do you think if Donald Trump just just basically runs circles around everybody in Iowa, that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=603.34s)]
*  New Hampshire Republican voters may say, hold on, we're going to put our support behind [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=609.58s)]
*  Nikki Haley or Chris Christie? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=613.62s)]
*  Or do you think that a successful caucus for Donald Trump and Iowa will pretty much mean [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=615.3s)]
*  that everybody will get in line in New Hampshire? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=620.42s)]
*  I don't see that. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=623.38s)]
*  And I would take charge, I think, with the idea of New Hampshire voters exactly being [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=626.2199999999999s)]
*  contrarian. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=631.1s)]
*  But more independent thinking is how I used to used to think of us. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=632.54s)]
*  But what I see in New Hampshire, honestly, is that Donald Trump's support has been deep [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=638.2199999999999s)]
*  and broad, both, and that it has been consistent. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=642.86s)]
*  And while Nikki Haley has been able to sort of creep up closer and closer, remember that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=647.06s)]
*  that really happened and supported in great part by the spending millions and millions [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=652.22s)]
*  of dollars of spending by Americans for Prosperity over the last month. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=658.82s)]
*  And now that she is getting closer, you know, as to the previous point, Trump has the ability [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=662.58s)]
*  to just crush her if he wants to in New Hampshire. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=668.38s)]
*  I think, you know, the I think somebody just referenced that she was within striking [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=673.5400000000001s)]
*  within striking distance. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=678.94s)]
*  I don't necessarily really agree with that. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=680.22s)]
*  I don't think she's quite there yet. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=682.06s)]
*  If she gets down within single digits, then she's within striking distance. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=683.5s)]
*  But I think Donald Trump has himself perfectly positioned still in spite of her rise. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=688.3399999999999s)]
*  I think he's going to win New Hampshire. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=694.02s)]
*  I think he's going to continue to win after that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=695.9s)]
*  And then what I really think is the interesting question, you know, is going to be at what [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=699.06s)]
*  point does the RNC step in and publicly suggest that everybody else should get out of the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=705.7399999999999s)]
*  way? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=711.2199999999999s)]
*  I think that they will eventually come in and ask Mickey Haley to step aside. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=711.58s)]
*  You know, Brendan cynically, you know, in previous election seasons, 2012, you know, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=717.22s)]
*  2016, where there usually is somebody who's a really, really strong candidate. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=723.1s)]
*  A lot of times, political commentators, analysts will say, well, you know what, these people [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=727.34s)]
*  are just running for vice president. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=730.62s)]
*  Given how Donald Trump treated his last vice president and his supporters threatened his [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=732.94s)]
*  last vice president, do you think there is anyone in the current Republican field who has [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=737.42s)]
*  that delusion? Is Nikki Haley thinking to herself, well, you know what, I, you know, I [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=743.14s)]
*  might miss the moon, but I'll be amongst the stars. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=747.3s)]
*  Donald Trump will pick me. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=749.3s)]
*  I know Chris Christie couldn't have that idea. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=750.34s)]
*  Are there any Republicans now who think that that's their opportunity or are they still [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=752.38s)]
*  really running because they either think that Trump will stumble or maybe they'll have a [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=756.66s)]
*  chance to raise some more money? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=760.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think at this point, you know, Nikki Haley and Rhonda Sanchez, the two more serious [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=762.94s)]
*  people are really just running to save face. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=766.58s)]
*  I think Nikki Haley is hoping that she can have a strong second. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=769.3000000000001s)]
*  And if Donald Trump loses in a general election, she is potentially still viable and kind of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=772.4200000000001s)]
*  say, I told you so. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=776.82s)]
*  I think Rhonda Sanchez is trying to salvage something of his future. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=778.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the shine has completely come off of Rhonda Sanchez. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=782.74s)]
*  And if he comes in third in Iowa after spending so much time there, it has to basically [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=785.5s)]
*  drop out in shame. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=790.6600000000001s)]
*  His future may be done. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=792.46s)]
*  I think he sees himself as if not this time, I still need to be able to run in the future. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=793.66s)]
*  I'm sure Nikki Haley the same. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=798.66s)]
*  So they're trying to save their future, I think, at this point more than anything. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=799.9399999999999s)]
*  Jennifer, very quickly, we've talked about this earlier in the show. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  There is just a litany of court cases that Donald Trump is going to have to face heading [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=808.18s)]
*  into primary season. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=814.02s)]
*  Do you think that has any impact at all, that there may actually be some Super Tuesday [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=815.38s)]
*  states that he doesn't necessarily have as much time to campaign in because he's going [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=819.74s)]
*  to be in court? Will that make any difference one way or another? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=823.82s)]
*  I really don't think it will in the end. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=827.0200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't need to campaign in person the way all the other candidates do. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=828.58s)]
*  And we've seen time after time after time that the more the more the more the more [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=832.62s)]
*  indictments he faces, the more legal trouble he faces, the deeper that his support grows [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=838.74s)]
*  in most amongst most Republican voters. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=845.4200000000001s)]
*  They believe that Donald Trump is a symbol for themselves and their party, that he's [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=848.26s)]
*  being attacked is somehow an attack on them. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=853.34s)]
*  And as long as yes, I really don't think it's going to impact the outcome of this race. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuycvc_Hjz4&t=857.6999999999999s)]
