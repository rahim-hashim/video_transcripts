# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 5
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Hope you had a good July 4th weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=0.0s)]
*  We are rapidly approaching the real, actual, serious for now start of the 24 Republican primary. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=4.0s)]
*  The first RNC debate is next month in Milwaukee where the Republicans will also hold their 2024 convention. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=10.0s)]
*  And while it's still too early for any real predictions about who voters will choose or how this is all going to play out, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=17.0s)]
*  right now, speaking as of today, it does look like Donald Trump is way ahead of everyone else. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=22.0s)]
*  And that's in large part because Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was initially hyped up as the candidate who could take on Trump, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=28.0s)]
*  has seen his poll numbers tank. Just look at the polling averages since the start of this calendar year. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=35.0s)]
*  DeSantis' line should come with its own slide whistle. He's almost 30 points behind Trump at an average of the national polls. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=42.0s)]
*  Even a top official at a pro DeSantis super PAC recently conceded the Florida governor's campaign has been a bust so far. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=50.0s)]
*  Right now in national polling, we are way behind. I'll be the first to admit that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=58.0s)]
*  OK, I believe in being really blunt and really honest. It's an uphill battle. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=63.0s)]
*  I don't think it's an unwinnable battle by any stretch. OK, but clearly, Donald Trump is the is the runaway front runner in the first four states, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=67.0s)]
*  which matter tremendously. Polls are a lot tighter. We're clearly still down. We're down double digits. We have work to do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=75.0s)]
*  We have wood to chop. Now, it does seem like a bad sign when one of your top surrogates has to admit that your opponent is the runaway front runner, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=80.0s)]
*  although, you know, credit where due. It's true, at least. And there are a lot of reasons that DeSantis campaign is doing so poorly. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=87.0s)]
*  One reason is what some are calling a lack of charisma, which seems to be alienating voters on the campaign trail, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=93.0s)]
*  especially in those early states where you do a lot of retail politicking. You could judge yourself. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=99.0s)]
*  Here he is in action during a campaign stop at the southern border. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=104.0s)]
*  There were people I was reading from Tajikistan coming to the southern border. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=109.0s)]
*  I remember seeing Libya there now have I think they've identified about 10,000 Chinese nationals coming across the southern border. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=114.0s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, there's no accounting for taste. Does that do that for you? I don't know. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=125.0s)]
*  The candidate quality issues are only partially to blame for DeSantis decline, however, a big part of the reason I would submit that he has failed to gain any traction [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=130.0s)]
*  is he has chosen whether he realizes or not to run this weird alienating hard right campaign like a Ron DeSantis doesn't care who he offends kind of thing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=139.0s)]
*  And again, I understand the logic here because it really is the case that there's an appetite for that kind of thing in the Republican base. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=150.0s)]
*  And he thinks, I think if I can game it out, he can gain some traction in the darkest, most anti-social corners of the Internet where cruelty is a virtue. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=157.0s)]
*  But I think even those folks and the people he's trying to appeal to will find his campaign's latest video to be as desperate and thirsty as the rest of us do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=167.0s)]
*  But Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom. You would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=188.0s)]
*  That is correct. In the future, can transgender women compete in this universe? Yes. Make America great again. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=196.0s)]
*  I cannot think of anything more horrifying. It really has shut down drag. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=217.0s)]
*  Just produced some of the harshest, most draconian laws that literally threaten trans existence. Congratulations Ron DeSantis. Mission accomplished. You win. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=227.0s)]
*  Okay, there's a lot to say here. First, let me just say I understand. I am probably you are not the target audience for that video, which again, fine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=247.0s)]
*  But everything about it is just so strange and so entirely alienating. I mean, yes, it's bait for folks like me, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=262.0s)]
*  Oh, the liberals, including me in that video, they don't like Don DeSantis, therefore you should like him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=270.0s)]
*  But again, that's lost underneath the crushing weight of the sheer effort of the uber online Twitter nerds who came up with this, who cannot or will not understand how to act and interact with other people like a normal person. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=275.0s)]
*  In fact, I would go so far as to say that most people are not even the target audience for this video. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=293.0s)]
*  I mean, even most Republicans are not the target audience for this video. When you're trying to compare yourself favorably to the serial killer from American Psycho, you may have lost the thread a bit. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=298.0s)]
*  When you've hired campaign staffers, one of whom tweeted the video, who have lauded praise on Holocaust denier Nick Flentes, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=311.0s)]
*  Who like to hang out in the parts of the Internet where people impress each other with how much of an edge word they are and how they're never going to get married or have any kind of romantic relationship. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=318.0s)]
*  Well, maybe this is the kind of campaign you end up running. So you've got a disgusting, you know, whatever homophobic offensive video released on the last day of Pride Month because again, this is all overly determined, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=328.0s)]
*  They're trying to incite a backlash. And I get that this video exists again for that purpose. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=340.0s)]
*  Like we all see what you're doing. There's nothing subtle here. But again, even on its own terms, I think you missed the mark. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=346.0s)]
*  My strong instinct is that even to the base, this comes across like Jeb's infamous please clap moment. Like look at how edgy we are. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=352.0s)]
*  On that show where Steve Cortez admits DeSantis is behind it by a mile, the host in an informal and unscientific survey of his very online listener. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=361.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a crypto layer, of course, which had Trump trouncing DeSantis by 60 points. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=371.0s)]
*  So he's not even winning over the kind of like hyper engaged Twitter people he's targeting. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=376.0s)]
*  And then, of course, there are costs to this kind of thing. I mean, politicians, politics is addition, not subtraction, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=382.0s)]
*  It's cliche, but it's true. Many prominent LGBTQ Republicans who are at least somewhat supportive of DeSantis are now turning their backs on him. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=387.0s)]
*  As Philip Bump points out in The Washington Post today, you can't out conservative Trump. You can't outmag him. You can't out Trump Trump. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=395.0s)]
*  There is no opening to run to his right on the culture war stuff. Quote, DeSantis was seen as the alternative to Trump by those who didn't like Trump. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=402.0s)]
*  It seems increasingly apparent he's now seen as the alternative to Trump by those who do like Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=410.0s)]
*  As long as Trump is in the race and as long as the race centers on Trump's worldview, DeSantis won't be able to pass him. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=415.0s)]
*  Again, I'm an outsider looking in here and I will be the first to admit it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=422.0s)]
*  And I will be the first to admit that you don't necessarily go to Chris Hayes for like the most obvious insight into the thinking of the median Republican primary voter stipulated. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=426.0s)]
*  But again, my two cents, if you want to beat Donald Trump, the Republican primary, here's what I think is obvious. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=435.0s)]
*  You need to kind of comfort his voters and keep them in your fold, right? You cannot be seen as anti Trump. Totally get that. That's true. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=441.0s)]
*  But then you got to convince them you're a better and more electable alternative and then add them to the people who were not that interested in voting for Trump again, the primary. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=447.0s)]
*  That's how you add up the coalition big enough to win. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=454.0s)]
*  You are not going to get there by trying to convince the biggest dorks on the Internet that you are even more of a callous psychopath than he is. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=457.0s)]
*  Yesterday on the Fourth of July, we got a very weird and seemingly sudden ruling from a judge, federal judge in the Western District of Louisiana with some broad First Amendment implications. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=466.0s)]
*  The federal judge barred parts of the administration from contacting social media platforms about online content. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=477.0s)]
*  Now, the ruling came in response to a lawsuit brought by Republican led states alleging that the White House went too far in its efforts to curb content that challenged vaccines or threatened elections. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=486.0s)]
*  So this federal injunction handed down by the judge as of yesterday bars key federal agencies, including the CDC, the Department of Justice and the Department of State from even contacting social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram over concerns like misinformation on COVID-19. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=498.0s)]
*  And the ruling, the judge accuses the federal government of some pretty heady stuff saying they were running an Orwellian ministry of truth, suppression of opposition and dissent. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=515.0s)]
*  When you do a little Googling, you quickly discovered the plaintiffs, a Republican attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri, very clearly filed this case in this small district in Louisiana because they knew there was a good chance they would get this guy on your screen. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=525.0s)]
*  Judge Terry Doty. That's the same judge who blocked the vaccine mandate for health care workers in the middle of a once in a century pandemic. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=539.0s)]
*  Joyce Vance, the former US attorney from Northern District of Alabama, now a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, and she joins me now. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=549.0s)]
*  Joyce, I got to say I have read most of this most of this opinion. It's a real kind of head scratcher. Just take us through what the judge is ordering here. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=557.0s)]
*  So the judge in essence is shutting down communication between broad parts of the federal government and the social media platforms. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=567.0s)]
*  And Chris, this is a two way exchange where the government shares information with the private sector about threats and risks and the private sector shares its own information with the government. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=577.0s)]
*  None of us are safer with this sort of exchange shut down. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=589.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can understand and be sympathetic to in the abstract concerns about government coercion vis-a-vis speech platforms like Facebook or Twitter. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=594.0s)]
*  It doesn't strike me as crazy, right, that you would have those concerns. In this specific case, there's a lot focused on COVID. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=603.0s)]
*  And it was interesting to me this like here's here's here's Fauci on TV on MSNBC. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=609.0s)]
*  It's cited in the ruling talking about hydroxychloroquine. Take a take a listen. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=617.0s)]
*  All of those trials show consistently that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of coronavirus disease. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=624.0s)]
*  Now that that's true. I mean, and has been true and is actually importantly true because lots of people were trying it and it wasn't working. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=634.0s)]
*  It's important that you know that it's not effective. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=641.0s)]
*  And then the ruling by this judge says Dr. Fauci made statements on Good Morning America and on Andrea Mitchell reports that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in treating the coronavirus. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=644.0s)]
*  Social media platforms censored the America's frontline doctors video on the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=653.0s)]
*  But there's no like causal relationship or even coercion alleged here. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=659.0s)]
*  He just seems to be like implying it in a federal judicial order. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=664.0s)]
*  You know, I sense your frustration, Chris, and I want to echo it here because the allegation is a First Amendment violation by the government that the government is compelling or restraining speech. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=670.0s)]
*  And there's none of that. None of that established in this complaint. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=681.0s)]
*  This is a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs, the attorney generals and other parties have to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=685.0s)]
*  But they can't show that the government was telling these companies that they had to remove speech from their platform just because Dr. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=694.0s)]
*  Fauci was on television speaking the truth. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=700.0s)]
*  There's also this question that kind of haunts this case when I saw the ruling, which is the sort of forum shopping problem. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=705.0s)]
*  We saw it's most famously been a problem with Judge Kaz Merrick, who is a district court judge in Amarillo, Texas, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=713.0s)]
*  where the plaintiffs who wanted to get Mipha Preston taken off the shelves went and they not only sued, but they tried to get a nationwide injunction. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=720.0s)]
*  They succeeded in issuing a nationwide injunction. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=728.0s)]
*  It was later stayed by a circuit court that would cut access off for people across the country. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=731.0s)]
*  It just seems like a very clear playbook here to file this suit in this part of Louisiana, knowing you're getting a guy. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=737.0s)]
*  And I wonder what you think of it as this sort of loophole jurisdiction hacking that we're seeing increasingly. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=743.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I think this situation is a little bit different. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=751.0s)]
*  I mean, I think you're absolutely correct to point out that they sought this particular judge out because they were aware that he had granted a series of injunctions in covid vaccine cases. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=755.0s)]
*  And he seemed to have a lot of animosity towards vaccines and the government's approach to covid in general. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=766.0s)]
*  But this is a judge who was confirmed 98 zero in the Senate. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=772.0s)]
*  He's someone who was well qualified. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=776.0s)]
*  The ABA rated him that way. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=778.0s)]
*  He had been both a prosecutor and a state court judge. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=780.0s)]
*  He seems to have an issue in this one area. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=783.0s)]
*  And what you would expect to happen is that the Fifth Circuit would reverse him very quickly. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=787.0s)]
*  But the Fifth Circuit, of course, has become an uber conservative circuit. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=793.0s)]
*  And whether or not they will do that remains to be seen. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=798.0s)]
*  There are a lot of problems with this order, not the least of which is that the plaintiffs don't seem to have standing that basic doctrinal hurdle that parties have to pass to be in court. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=801.0s)]
*  There are so many flaws in this case, whether the Fifth Circuit takes it on remains to be seen. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=811.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should know the Fifth Circuit is also the appellate court for Judge Kaczmarek. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=817.0s)]
*  And there's lots of people who feel like the Fifth Circuit's inability to to rein in, you know, sort of avant garde federal district judges and their orders has been part of what has essentially, you know, allowed for these kind of these kind of nationwide injunctions to happen.

*  It has definitely contributed to that made nationwide injunctions, you know, have been a thing on both sides of the political aisle. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=839.0s)]
*  But the way that they're being used here in connection with judge shopping is particularly pernicious. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=847.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to be curious to see what the Fifth Circuit does with this. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=853.0s)]
*  And I think it's headed right for the Supreme Court. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=856.0s)]
*  Actually, we'll see what they make of it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=858.0s)]
*  Joyce Vance, thank you very much. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=860.0s)]
*  Thirty one million Americans are sweating it out with heat alerts impacting parts of the South and the West. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=865.0s)]
*  Authorities say a 57 year old woman died during an eight mile hike in the Grand Canyon, with tenths topping 100 degrees. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=871.0s)]
*  Cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix expected to again top triple digits today. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=879.0s)]
*  The extreme temperatures fueling fast moving flames in Washington state with fears that risk of wildfire may increase during July 4th celebrations. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=884.0s)]
*  Well, as it turned out yesterday, July 4th ended up being the world's hottest day on record. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=895.0s)]
*  Let me say it again. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=902.0s)]
*  The hottest day ever recorded since we began keeping track. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=903.0s)]
*  As environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben put it, no human has ever seen it hotter. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=907.0s)]
*  Quote, the best estimate of Klein scientists is that it was the hottest day since sometime in the last interglacial period. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=912.0s)]
*  A hundred and twenty five thousand years ago, right about the time that other scientists think humans etched the first symbols onto bone and started wearing shells as decorations. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=919.0s)]
*  And it broke the previous record set on, well, July 3rd, the day before. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=929.0s)]
*  For more than four decades, we've been taking this global temperature and average from all sorts of data points around the world. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=934.0s)]
*  You can think of it like a thermometer for the planet. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=941.0s)]
*  And it's telling us that we are spiking a very serious fever. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=943.0s)]
*  We've started to breach the threshold, surpassing the target for global warming set by experts and policymakers decades ago. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=947.0s)]
*  You may have heard this number to the amount of warning that we are trying not to exceed. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=954.0s)]
*  It's one point five degrees Celsius above what's called pre-industrial levels. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=958.0s)]
*  That is, before we started burning fossil fuels and pushing tons of carbon into the atmosphere. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=962.0s)]
*  Now, the thing about that number is it doesn't sound like much. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=968.0s)]
*  One point five degrees. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=971.0s)]
*  It's about two point seven degrees Fahrenheit, which is closer to understanding what it really means. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=972.0s)]
*  But if you think about it again, like a thermometer, it's like going from a normal ninety eight point six degree body temperature to spiking a one hundred and one point three degree fever. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=977.0s)]
*  A 101.3 degrees, you're pretty sick. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=989.0s)]
*  Like you're definitely feeling it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=992.0s)]
*  You're not going to die. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=994.0s)]
*  But if you spike a couple more degrees, you're going to probably end up in the hospital. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=995.0s)]
*  And that metaphor is almost literal because the human body really struggles in high heat, particularly when combined with humidity. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1002.0s)]
*  A recent heat wave in Texas resulted in hundreds of hospitalizations, at least 13 deaths, 11 of them coming in just one county. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1009.0s)]
*  Two others died while hiking at Big Bend National Park in West Texas. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1017.0s)]
*  As temperatures continue to rise, experts are acknowledging that we are more likely than not to exceed that one point five degree target. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1021.0s)]
*  In fact, it's all but assured at this point. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1029.0s)]
*  The only way to make sure we don't end up producing a kind of global hospitalization or a kind of civilizational heat death is to continue to rapidly expand investment in and deployment of carbon free energy. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1031.0s)]
*  And then we got to start figuring out how to take carbon out of the atmosphere at scale. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1045.0s)]
*  But even if we do that, it's going to get hot and hotter. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1051.0s)]
*  We are now finding out what it is like to live with a level of heat unlike anything humans have experienced for thousands of years. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1055.0s)]
*  And spoiler alert, it's not great. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1064.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq4qx3uVMF0&t=1084.0s)]
