# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU)
*  You've been closely watching this show and this network and even on social media you've probably heard of Project 2025 sometimes also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=0.0s)]
*  called the Presidential Transition Project. It's a 900 page policy document put together by a bunch of conservative interest groups as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=7.08s)]
*  a guide for how a second Trump administration can weaponize the federal government in pursuit of a frankly frighteningly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=14.88s)]
*  authoritarian vision. It's also a wish list of a bunch of fringe far right policy proposals that I think many voters would be [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=21.64s)]
*  really horrified to learn about. It seems like a lot of people are starting to pick up on the project project and its proposals [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=29.639999999999997s)]
*  thanks to warnings like this front. This one from host Taraji Beat Henson at this week's BT Awards. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=36.08s)]
*  Pay attention. It's not a secret. Look it up. They are attacking our most vulnerable citizens. The Project 2025 plan is not a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=44.48s)]
*  game. Look it up. According to some reports the project actually began trending on Google immediately after those comments. But [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=53.92s)]
*  even with the new influx of attention I still think the details of Project 2025 are undercover relative to how absolutely [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=61.6s)]
*  unhinged they are even by the standards of today's Republican Party. So first and foremost there is this nakedly authoritarian [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=68.72s)]
*  plotting like the plan to weaponize the Department of Justice as a tool directly under the control of Donald Trump. Quoting from the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=75.68s)]
*  document itself the DOJ falls under the direct supervision and control the president United States as a component of the executive branch. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Litigation decisions must be made consistent with the president's agenda. By the way Justice John Roberts just endorsed that in the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  six year immunity decision. So they've got carte blanche on that. What it means is that Donald Trump directs the Department of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  Justice. There is no independence. There's no firewall. He tells them what to do who to prosecute who to defend and the like. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=104.5s)]
*  And I think this portion of Project 2025 the authoritarian plots to purge the civil service service replace it all with MAGA [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=111.12s)]
*  loyalists like deep down into the government is getting most of the attention and for good reason. But there's so much more to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=119.16s)]
*  Project 2025 including again a whole bunch of fringe hard right culture stuff. So for instance unsurprisingly the document calls [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=125.28s)]
*  for a full out whole of government approach the assault on reproductive rights on women for conservatives to gratefully celebrate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=132.88s)]
*  the greatest pro family win in a generation overturning Roe v. Wade. It includes an effective abortion ban by calling for the FDA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. They're going to point you left. Yeah. Who suddenly announced. Oh you can't have a medication abortion. Reverse its approval [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=151.24s)]
*  of chemical abortion drugs like meth or pristone which is used in the majority of all abortions in this country. And again in red and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=158.4s)]
*  blue states where abortion is legal or not. And to be clear there's no absolutely justification for this right. Meth or pristone [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=165.72s)]
*  has been used safely for decades. This is not a scientific determination. They're going to put some apparatchik in the charge of FDA [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=172.44s)]
*  to do this. Project 2025 wants to take it away citing in part the hundreds of thousands to millions of babies whose lives have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=180.12s)]
*  been unjustly taken through chemical abortion. Document goes further than FDA approval calls on the Department of Justice to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=187.76s)]
*  criminalize sending the pill through the mail under the Comstock Act an archaic anti obscenity law from the 19th century which [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=194.0s)]
*  has been rendered largely unreforcible in subsequent decades. In addition to the abortion bill project 2025 also wants to strip [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=202.44s)]
*  the mandate for free emergency contraception from Obamacare. And look Republicans are not going to stop until they have all but [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=209.72s)]
*  eliminated access to reproductive health care in this country full stop. They're also not surprisingly committed to stopping the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=216.56s)]
*  enormous seismic green energy transition to do must the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. The document refers to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=223.52s)]
*  attempts to mitigate climate change to mitigate it as a radical climate policy. It calls for an end to the unprovoked war on [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  fossil fuels for the government to oppose ice or windmills built at taxpayer expense. Document also calls for all federal laws [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=238.4s)]
*  grants regulations and contracts to delete every instance of the terms sexual orientation and gender identity diversity equity [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=246.68s)]
*  inclusion gender gender equality gender equity gender awareness gender sensitive abortion reproductive health and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  reproductive rights saying they're used to prize Americans of their First Amendment rights reproductive health. It demands the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=261.68s)]
*  Department of Health and Human Services immediately put an end to the department's foray into woke transgender activism and get [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=268.48s)]
*  this. I don't think people know this but people should. Pornography should be outlawed and the people who produce and distribute it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  should be imprisoned. America 2024. Now I promise you I could go on like this for an entire hour. I encourage you to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=282.48s)]
*  read the document for yourself. Remarkably easy to find with a cursory search online. And that of course is because [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=291.56s)]
*  Republicans are incredibly proud of their little project. Listen to the project's architect the president of the Heritage Foundation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=296.84s)]
*  on this network last month. The organization in this plan talks about changing the Department of Health and Human Services to the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=303.36s)]
*  Department of Life. Do you think that women in America should be able to get an abortion if that is what their doctor says they [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=310.44s)]
*  need. Abortions not health care. I find it really interesting if not worse that you wouldn't support the change of the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=318.36s)]
*  department name to the Department of Life. I thought we were all in support of life. We believe imminently in women's rights [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  and particularly women's rights in the womb. Women in the womb that position is openly and proudly out of touch with what most [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=332.68s)]
*  American wants. That's sort of the point because Project Twenty Twenty Twenty Five is in many respects about power about a right [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=339.8s)]
*  wing vanguard minority forcing its fringe agenda onto the American voters by any means necessary. This is what we're going to go [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=346.64s)]
*  to do. And you can't stop us. And if you think I'm exaggerating just listen to that same Heritage Foundation president on an episode of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=354.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon's podcast yesterday guest hosted by former Republican Congressman Dave Bratt because Bannon is currently in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=361.44s)]
*  prison. We're in the process of taking this country back. The reason that they are apoplectic right now the reason that so many [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=368.44s)]
*  anchors on MSNBC for example are losing their minds daily is because our side is winning. And so I come full circle in this [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=377.28s)]
*  response and just want to encourage you with some substance that we are in the process of the Second American Revolution which will [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=387.08s)]
*  remain bloodless if the left allows it to be. Right on. Thank you brother. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=393.28s)]
*  I'm cool buddy. We're in the process of the Second American Revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  In other words we won't be violent if you don't make us. They're not really bothering to veil the threats anymore. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  Project 2025 is a straight up dictatorial fantasy of control over the American people. When they talk about revolution taking the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=415.96s)]
*  country back. What this mean is that this small coterie of hard right zealots these freely creepy weirdos are going to exert total [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=422.52s)]
*  control over every aspect of your life in terms of what you look at and what you read what you mail what your health care is. That [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  guy controlling your health care. What that. We're not trying to hide it. And everyone should know. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=441.32s)]
*  You remember that story from a couple of years ago where the former NFL quarterback Brett Favre was caught up in a state of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=452.0s)]
*  Mississippi welfare fraud scandal. It involved state officials diverting funds meant for poor mostly black women and children [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=457.64s)]
*  according to public records. The series ran in this small nonprofit outlet called Mississippi Today. And we featured it on our [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=465.6s)]
*  show quite a bit. We spoke with Anna Wolf the reporter who broke the story back in September of 2022. It was just a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=471.92s)]
*  remarkably impressive piece of investigative journalism that went on to win a Pulitzer last year. But since then as NBC News [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=478.72s)]
*  correspondent Ken Delaney and explains the reporter has been embroiled in a lawsuit that might land her in jail. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=485.92s)]
*  This is the kind of corruption that Mississippians know all too well. Anna Wolf's reporting at Mississippi Today exposed a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=492.68s)]
*  huge scandal in the poorest state in America. Seventy seven million dollars in welfare funds intended for children in need [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=501.4s)]
*  went instead to multiple pet projects including this horse ranch this volleyball arena and to sports celebrities like Hall of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=509.2s)]
*  Fame quarterback Brett Favre. Favre was never charged but the reporting led to eight criminal indictments and journalism's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  biggest prize. Adam Ganachow is the editor of the paper. You can't just win a Pulitzer unless there's real impact. Two days [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=523.24s)]
*  after the Pulitzer announcement we got the first threat of legal action. Former Mississippi governor Phil Bryant who was in [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  office when the fraud occurred is suing the newspaper Wolf and other staffers for defamation saying Mississippi Today [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=537.88s)]
*  wrongly accused him of a crime. Allegations in court documents suggest Bryant was among those who directed the spending. But he [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  maintains he did nothing illegal. I did nothing wrong. I wasn't aware of the wrongdoings of others. How would you explain to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=551.68s)]
*  somebody who's never heard about this Phil Bryant's overall role in the welfare scandal. So it's pretty well laid out. It [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=559.4799999999999s)]
*  doesn't say that he did anything illegal. This is an agency under the governor's office. I mean he has control. He has [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=566.28s)]
*  oversight. Bryant did not initially sue over the newspaper's prize winning reporting. Instead he brought the case over how the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=573.28s)]
*  reporting was later described including when the newspaper's CEO said Bryant embezzled funds which is not true. He was never [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  charged and there's no indication he's under criminal investigation. Bryant's attorney Billy Quinn says that was the last straw. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=587.76s)]
*  So here we are to give one of their favorite words accountability to the situation. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=595.2s)]
*  Well the rabbits got the gun. Now we'll see who's going to be accountable. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=602.04s)]
*  The rabbits got the gun. Now think about that phrase because the former governor of Mississippi is a public figure suing for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=607.56s)]
*  definition. Defamation he must show there was actual malice basically a reckless disregard for the truth. And so he's asking for the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  papers internal emails and the names of confidential sources. That is something journalists simply do not divulge. If Wolf and her [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=621.68s)]
*  editor do not turn over their files they face possible prison time. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=629.04s)]
*  Are you willing to go to jail. Yeah it's real. It's scary but something I think we feel very strongly about. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=634.4s)]
*  Free press is essential to the workings of a free society. And what Anna Wolf and her editors are facing right now is really scary [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=643.88s)]
*  stuff. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkaEDg2cEfU&t=650.8s)]
