# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ)
*  There are those that say there's something about you that's not connecting for whatever [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  reason, not connecting with the voter, whether it be personality. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=4.68s)]
*  Donald Trump says it's about loyalty. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=8.56s)]
*  Francis Suarez says it's about your relationships. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=10.48s)]
*  And it's not about those individuals so much. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=13.8s)]
*  I'm curious in the analysis of Ron DeSantis of why it not yet is connecting. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=15.56s)]
*  Well, I think, did you just see the news today about the record fundraising haul we've had? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=22.6s)]
*  Nobody's been able to match that in the history of modern presidential politics. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=29.24s)]
*  Okay, a few things. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=33.8s)]
*  Now, to be fair, Ron DeSantis, it's an impossible question posed by Fox News' Fill-In host last [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=36.92s)]
*  night who has had his own troubles connecting in the past. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  There's no good way for any politician to answer like, what's wrong with you? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=44.64s)]
*  Why don't people like you? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=49.26s)]
*  And yet it's a consistent genre of campaign questions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=50.26s)]
*  But that really is not the kind of question a candidate wants to be hearing at this point [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=54.08s)]
*  in the campaign. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=58.0s)]
*  And on that front, DeSantis really does only have himself to blame for being in this position, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=59.24s)]
*  pulling 30 points behind Donald Trump six weeks after formally launching his bid for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=63.6s)]
*  president. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=68.28s)]
*  The Florida governor has made a career out of being the far right-wing king. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=69.28s)]
*  From the don't say gay law to banning trans health care in the state of Florida and banning [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  abortion after six weeks and shipping migrants out of the state, possibly in what some believe [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  was a criminal scheme. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=83.04s)]
*  DeSantis has positioned himself as the hardest core member of the MAGA army. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=84.88s)]
*  And while that may get him air time on Fox, and in fact it has, I don't think it's broadly [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  popular among the general population, general electorate. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  But also, there's a precedent here he should think of, because others have tried this exact [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=99.6s)]
*  same model before and it failed spectacularly. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=104.64s)]
*  Do you remember the disastrous presidential campaign of one Texas Senator, Ted Cruz? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=109.32s)]
*  In 2016, he tried to run on his record as, well, for lack of a better way of phrasing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=114.88s)]
*  it, an extreme conservative jerk. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=120.36s)]
*  In his very first year in office, Cruz helped engineer a pointless government shutdown. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  He alienated members of his own party and fueled punchlines with his antics, including [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=127.88s)]
*  a secret meeting at a Tex-Mex restaurant called Tortilla Coast and a dramatic reading of Dr. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=133.06s)]
*  Seuss during a marathon filibuster. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=139.12s)]
*  Cruz went on to stake out the furthest right positions on everything from immigration to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  gay marriage, calling the landmark Supreme Court ruling on marriage, quote, among the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=165.6s)]
*  darkest hours of our nation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  And on climate change, Cruz went so far to the right, he basically fell off the edge [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=172.18s)]
*  of his flat earth. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=176.34s)]
*  The satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=179.1s)]
*  for 17 years. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=185.1s)]
*  Now that's a real problem for the global warming alarmist. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=187.0s)]
*  Today the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat earthers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, it used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=195.34s)]
*  The earth is flat and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=198.3s)]
*  The satellite data, how's that holding up? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=204.58s)]
*  No warming. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=206.82s)]
*  You think there's no warming happening? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=207.82s)]
*  So that was the 2016 version of the Ron DeSantis playbook. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=209.58s)]
*  Be as obnoxiously right-wing as possible. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=213.02s)]
*  And yes, Cruz did eke out a win in Iowa. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=215.44s)]
*  Do we all remember that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=217.46s)]
*  He won Iowa. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=218.46s)]
*  And he took on Carly Fiorina as a running mate. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=219.74s)]
*  And he did look like a contender, sort of, for a little while. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=222.54s)]
*  But in the end, how did the obnoxious far-right act work out for Ted? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=226.54s)]
*  Nasty guy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=231.54s)]
*  Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=232.54s)]
*  I hate Ted Cruz. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=235.82s)]
*  Lucifer in the flesh. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=236.82s)]
*  I hate Ted Cruz. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=237.82s)]
*  And I think I'll say sayonara if he ever got the nomination. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=238.82s)]
*  I'm beginning to understand why Ted Cruz has been hated by everyone, every place he's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  ever been, from kindergarten to the United States Senate. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=247.18s)]
*  If you killed Ted Cruz before the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody could [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=250.34s)]
*  get you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=257.7s)]
*  He is lying, Ted. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=258.7s)]
*  It's L-Y-I-N-' lying, Ted. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=259.7s)]
*  Once again, lying, Ted. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=263.7s)]
*  Sir, America is a better country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=266.7s)]
*  Without you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=270.18s)]
*  On June 28th, a federal judge in Tennessee, who was appointed by Donald Trump, temporarily [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=271.18s)]
*  blocked portions of a state ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=278.74s)]
*  In the nearly 70-page opinion, the judge writes, quote, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  Parents have a fundamental right to direct the medical care of their children, which [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=287.14s)]
*  naturally includes the right of parents to request certain medical treatments on behalf [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=291.1s)]
*  of their children. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=295.06s)]
*  And when considering the irreparable harm that could come to trans youth were the law [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=296.58s)]
*  to go in effect, the judge writes, each minor plaintiff has submitted a declaration that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=300.14s)]
*  details the negative consequences they expect to endure as a result of SB1 becoming effective. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=304.48s)]
*  These expectations are not mere conjecture, but instead are supported by the medical evidence [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=310.48s)]
*  on the record. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=315.24s)]
*  So far, six different federal judges, including Trump-appointed judges in Indiana and Alabama, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=317.12s)]
*  have ruled against these bans, either in part or in total. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=323.16s)]
*  It's a really remarkable string of legal victories for trans rights against an increasingly [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  intense campaign of repression. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=331.48s)]
*  Chase Strangio is the deputy director for the ACLU's Transgender Justice Division, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=338.76s)]
*  First of all, just your reaction, Chase, to the opinion in Indiana, but there's been a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=339.76s)]
*  series of them in different venues that sound remarkably similar. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=344.8s)]
*  What's the argument that you're making to federal judges like this judge in Tennessee, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=350.8s)]
*  and what's the reception been like? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so it has been a clear and unanimous rejection of these laws. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=358.0s)]
*  And when the evidence is tested, which is what we suspected, the judges recognize that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  there really is no evidence supporting these categorical bans. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=366.88s)]
*  They are based on ideology opposing trans people. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=370.64s)]
*  They're based on misinformation, and they're based in politics. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=374.44s)]
*  We know that this is escalating in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=377.56s)]
*  And when we go to court, we argue that these laws violate the Equal Protection Clause and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=382.16s)]
*  the Due Process Clause of the Constitution and put forth medical evidence, including [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=386.48s)]
*  expert witness testimony, the judges are unanimous and clear that these laws just simply do not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=391.04s)]
*  hold up. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  There's something really striking about that I want to just stay on for a moment. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  I was thinking there's something similar with what happened with the claims of voter fraud [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  and voter regularities, right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=407.44s)]
*  So you've got all these people saying, oh, they're stealing the votes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  And then what happens is you go into court and you say the court asked for evidence. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=412.08s)]
*  And after 2020, they went zero for 60, right? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=417.08s)]
*  They went to a bunch of courts. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=420.2s)]
*  They said, no, there's no evidence. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=421.2s)]
*  It is pretty striking that in this area where there has been a lot of coverage and contestation [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=422.2s)]
*  and people saying there's lots of problems with medical care for trans youth, that when [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=426.82s)]
*  they're brought under the rules of evidence into federal courts across the ideological [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=431.64s)]
*  And it is litigated on the facts that every single judge basically has cited with plaintiffs [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=437.6s)]
*  like yourself. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=443.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  And when the other side, when the state's defending these laws put forth their purported [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=445.64000000000004s)]
*  experts in every single case, the courts have found that these so-called experts are unreliable, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=450.48s)]
*  inconsistent and making claims that simply are illogical. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=457.56s)]
*  And so it is very similar to the voter fraud allegations. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=461.36s)]
*  It is very similar to the anti-abortion playbook in terms of the rhetoric in the way it's being covered in the media. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=464.64s)]
*  I will say that at the end of the day, having now been in court in four different jurisdictions, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=469.92s)]
*  we receive a fairer play in front of these federal judges across the country than we [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=475.16s)]
*  do in the center-left media. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=480.56s)]
*  The, you know, the New York Times, the pages of the New York Times don't look at the evidence [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=482.04s)]
*  in the ways that we had these federal judges look at the evidence. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=486.4s)]
*  When they look at the medical evidence, there is simply nothing supporting these bans other [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=489.72s)]
*  than sensationalized claims and misinformation. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  And that is really important to understand because at the core of this are thousands [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=497.72s)]
*  of young people across the country who are about to lose the medical care that they are [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=502.20000000000005s)]
*  relying on. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  And we are falling prey to this campaign of misinformation that is being escalated in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=507.64000000000004s)]
*  the lead up to the 2024 presidential election. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and on that point I had you on a podcast, Wise is Happening, a few months ago you were [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=515.52s)]
*  talking about this, right, about this sort of just onslaught of these laws. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=520.52s)]
*  And one of the things that you and I were discussing, when you talk about irreparable [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=524.04s)]
*  harm, which is the standard to sort of enjoin a law, you know, anyone who is on any kind [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  of medication that they have a prescription to, they need, particularly if you are on [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=533.0s)]
*  SSRIs, which tens of millions of Americans are, including myself, you know, you can't [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  go three or four days and just get cut off from it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=541.48s)]
*  The irreparable harm of a law that just tells people from one day to the next, like you [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=545.88s)]
*  are cut off from your medication that a doctor under doctor supervision has prescribed you, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=549.64s)]
*  that's something else that is stuck out in these decisions of all these judges recognizing [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=554.5200000000001s)]
*  just how unjustifiable and unjustified that would be. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=560.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=565.2800000000001s)]
*  Not just, I mean, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the young people, for their parents who [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  would then have to watch them suffer. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=571.16s)]
*  And the arguments that are put forth as justification for these bans are things like the medication [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=572.76s)]
*  has side effects. I think we can all understand that all medication has potential side effects, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=578.48s)]
*  things like they are prescribed off label. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=583.0s)]
*  In pediatrics, sometimes as many as 80 percent of medications are prescribed off label. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  Every single justification for these laws is true of so much of medicine that if these [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=590.68s)]
*  justifications were to be credited, then every form of medication, anything could be under [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  assault. And every single judge has recognized that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=601.76s)]
*  Anyone who's a parent knows that when your child is suffering, you are doing whatever [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  you can to alleviate that suffering. We have parents who are going into court and bearing [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=609.48s)]
*  their souls and the judges thankfully are hearing them. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=614.28s)]
*  And what I want now is for the country to hear those parents and these young people [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=617.04s)]
*  who need their medication. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  Judge Eli Richardson in Tennessee pointed this out, that the sort of consensus that's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=623.56s)]
*  emerged from these federal courts on these laws. I thought it was interesting. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=628.16s)]
*  Though the court would not hesitate to be an outlier if it found such an outcome to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  be required, the court finds it noteworthy that its resolution of the present motion [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=634.5999999999999s)]
*  brings it into the ranks of courts that have unanimously come to the same conclusion when [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=638.1199999999999s)]
*  considering very similar laws. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=643.56s)]
*  Chase Strangio, who has had quite a role in this outcome and the struggle of course on [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=645.68s)]
*  this continues, but it's very heartening to see this from the federal courts. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=651.12s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. Good to see you. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZqgmfNlTQ&t=655.8000000000001s)]
