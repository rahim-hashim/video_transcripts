# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Feb. 2
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI)
*  Congressman Jason Crowe is a Democrat of Colorado who sits in the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=3.44s)]
*  And he joins me now. Congressman, your thoughts on the strikes that have been announced tonight? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Good evening. I agree with Senator Duckworth that this appears to be a good response that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=15.6s)]
*  shows strength, shows capability, and retaliates for the killing of our soldiers, but also avoids [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=21.84s)]
*  de-escalation. So that's the near-term analysis, but the long-term analysis also, as Senator Duckworth [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=28.16s)]
*  aptly pointed out, must be. How does this serve our longer-term interests? What is the end game [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=35.2s)]
*  here? You know, most of my adult life, we've been fighting and have had conflict in the Middle East. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=41.6s)]
*  So we very clearly need a different model. We've been walking around carrying a hammer for the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  last couple of decades. Every problem looks like a nail. So what does a different model look like [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=52.0s)]
*  that can actually de-escalate and change the entire scenario long-term for the Middle East? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=57.2s)]
*  And that's the discussion that's really important for Congress to be engaged in. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=63.2s)]
*  Let me ask you what that is. I mean, I was struck tonight. You said for most of your life, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=67.36s)]
*  I think we're around the same age, Congressman. And I remember the Gulf War was when I was 11 in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=71.2s)]
*  1990. I'm 44 now, so 33 years that some sort of U.S. military activity directed at Iraq has been [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=76.88s)]
*  happening three-quarters of my life. When you say changing that model, what do you mean by that? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=84.0s)]
*  Well, you know, we, for a very long time, have over-reli-ed, this is my opinion, we have over-reli-ed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=92.88s)]
*  on military force. And the problem with that, and don't get me wrong, there is absolutely a time and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=98.72s)]
*  place to use military force. And I completely agree with the president in these retaliation [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=104.16s)]
*  strikes that are meant to reestablish deterrence. But we continue to do this over and over again. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=110.4s)]
*  So let's look at how do we readjust the proportion of the various tools in our toolbox, humanitarian, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  diplomatic, economic, and military. How do we find a better proportion and how do we leverage [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  all of those tools to better achieve an end that we frankly have not been able to achieve? So my [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=132.72s)]
*  argument is, my thesis here is, we have not brought the right proportion of those tools to bear, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=138.32s)]
*  and that's why we continue to have to use military force over and over again here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Let me follow up and ask about diplomatic channels with Iran. Obviously, there's a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=149.04s)]
*  number of interesting diplomatic channels that have developed recently. There's a Qatari channel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=152.56s)]
*  through which U.S. negotiators, including the director of CIA, William Burns, has been involved [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=158.48s)]
*  in negotiations with the Israelis and Hamas representatives through the Qataris for some kind [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=166.24s)]
*  of exchange of cessation of hostilities for mass release of hostages in Gaza. There is no real Iran [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  channel of diplomacy active right now. There was one that tried to revive that nuclear deal the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump administration ripped up. There's some channel through the Qataris, but do you think [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=191.2s)]
*  that's something that's needed lacking? Well, I'm almost always a proponent of establishing [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=195.76s)]
*  some method of communication to avoid misunderstanding because when you have very [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=203.44s)]
*  large and capable militaries that have significant capabilities that are operating in close proximity [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  to one another, a very easy way for this to go awry is for actions to be misunderstood, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  and that's why making sure that the retaliatory strikes that the administration took today were [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  carefully calibrated, were strategic, and were surgical because the misunderstanding is exactly [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  how this turns into a larger Middle East conflict with very large militaries fighting each other [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=232.24s)]
*  directly. When you have not a few soldiers being killed, which is a terrible tragedy in and of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=237.52s)]
*  itself, you have very large numbers of soldiers meeting themselves on the battlefield, which is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=244.24s)]
*  what we want to avoid at all costs here if we can. Let me ask you this, a slightly political [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=249.2s)]
*  question or a question about your constituents in your district. How top of mind is this for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=255.6s)]
*  the folks that you represent in the third district in Colorado? Well, it's very top of mind. I have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=260.96s)]
*  the honor of representing one of the most diverse congressional districts in the nation. 20% of my [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  constituents were born outside of the United States. I have 130 languages spoken in my community. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=274.32s)]
*  I have a large Jewish community. I have a large Arab community. I have a Palestinian diaspora. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=281.2s)]
*  I've been engaging with these folks weekly over the last couple of months. I engage with them all [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  the time the last couple of years, but I've been doing extra the last few months to make sure that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=293.12s)]
*  I'm listening to them, I'm hearing their concerns, and we figure out how we can address this because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=298.32s)]
*  it's their lived experience that informs my work. They have families and loved ones who are in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=303.52s)]
*  harm's way, whether it be in Israel or in Gaza. I held a roundtable a couple of months ago with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=309.28s)]
*  Palestinian members in my community, and one gentleman told me that he lost 50 members of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=316.4s)]
*  his family in the last couple of months. 50 members. That's one family. It's truly heartbreaking. So, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=321.28s)]
*  that informs my work to make sure that we are putting humanity first. We're putting the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=327.68s)]
*  protection of civilians first. I'm a former Army Ranger. I served three combat tours in Iraq and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=331.68s)]
*  Afghanistan. What I learned in that time is that the protection of civilians in conflict zones [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  is a mission essential priority. It's not secondary. It's not a distraction. You can achieve [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=343.36s)]
*  no mission, and you can make nobody safer unless civilians are protected, and that is a priority. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=348.88s)]
*  I've done a lot of work for the last couple of years to further that goal. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=355.6s)]
*  Congressman Jason Krull of the 6th District, not the 3rd. I misspoke. 3rd is Boebert, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=360.32s)]
*  6th District of Colorado. Thank you very much, Congressman. Appreciate it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=364.56s)]
*  We also have some breaking news tonight on the many legal cases facing Donald Trump. Judge [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=370.24s)]
*  Tonya Chutkin just formally canceled Trump's election interference trial that had been [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=374.4s)]
*  scheduled for March 4th, writing the quote, the court will set a new schedule if and when the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=379.84s)]
*  mandate is returned. The mandate, of course, is the long-awaited decision by the appellate [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=384.48s)]
*  court on the ex-president's claim of absolute immunity from prosecution. Until that ruling, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=390.16s)]
*  which we're still waiting for, we won't know when or if the D.C. trial, arguably the most important [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=395.76s)]
*  trial in recent American history, and certainly the four criminal cases against Trump, will happen. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  Just the kind of delay he wants. Joining me now, Harry Lippman, former Deputy Assistant Attorney [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=408.32s)]
*  General of the Department of Justice. Let's just start with this. I think this is just [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=412.56s)]
*  acknowledging what everyone knew to be true and is essentially just a kind of administrative move, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=416.96s)]
*  though it highlights the fact that it's now been three or four weeks, I think, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=421.6s)]
*  and we still don't have anything from the D.C. Circuit. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=426.48s)]
*  Yeah, 24 days. And yes, it's administrative. The mandate is what one needs for jurisdiction. So in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=429.44s)]
*  that sense, she says, it's not my case anymore. But that if and when sort of wafts off the page, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=435.36s)]
*  you can almost hear a sigh of frustration with it. D.C. Circuit, is there an if here? Will I ever see [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=443.44s)]
*  it again? So yes, a kind of checking of a box, but a little bit almost frustrated and poignant. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=450.88s)]
*  Yeah, I got that too. I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm reading into it, but I thought the if and when [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  was striking. Let's talk about. You didn't need the if. Yeah, that's right. She didn't have to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=463.28s)]
*  have the if. So let's talk about two other cases here. So one is the there's another thing we're [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=468.96s)]
*  waiting for, which is the ruling by Judge Ingoran in New York State Court where there's a civil [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  fraud trial. And we have a development there, which is that the former finance chief, Alan Weisselberg, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  is in negotiations to plead guilty to perjury for testimony during this civil fraud trial. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=489.2s)]
*  As part of the agreement, he would have to admit he'd lied on the witness stand in the recent civil [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=495.52s)]
*  fraud trial. It would likely not require to turn on his former boss. The potential agreement could [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=500.0s)]
*  strengthen Bragg's hand before the former president's trial could deter other witnesses in Mr. Trump's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=504.8s)]
*  circle from lying on the stand. What do you make of this? You know, he's become the human [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=509.52s)]
*  piñata for Donald Trump, like the ultimate whatever Trump touches dies, right? There's a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=515.6s)]
*  poignancy to it. And and he's just he just sits there and takes it because he and he doesn't [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=520.32s)]
*  want to cooperate. It's a pretty interesting I think the perjury is going to concern his testimony [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=525.36s)]
*  that he didn't really care about the 10000 versus 30000 foot discrepancy in the apartment. But it's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=531.52s)]
*  clear that he that he did. Now, that's that's not part of the of the case that was it's now being [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=538.08s)]
*  pursued. But prosecutors don't like perjury very much. And, you know, they came after him. But just [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=545.6s)]
*  what a completely, you know, defeated shell of a man, 76 years old and just standing there and and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  having to take it for his lifelong loyalty to to Fred Trump and Donald Trump. Yeah, he's you know, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=560.0s)]
*  he's the ultimate kind of roadkill here. Yes, that's a great point. And also, I'm sorry, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=567.52s)]
*  one more thing because of Angoren Angoren said the 31st and, you know, fifth that two weeks later, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=572.64s)]
*  that's that's a long time. So I think one can surmise that both this fact and he doesn't know [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=578.72s)]
*  any more than we do. They don't tell him in the in the DA's office, but that that Weisselberg may [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=584.4s)]
*  plead guilty. And also the report we got from Judge Jones, which set out all these ongoing problems, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=590.8s)]
*  those may well figure in Angoren's calculation of penalty need for for certain protections [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=597.36s)]
*  and the like. So I think that's the most likely explanation for why we're going two more weeks. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=604.72s)]
*  OK, finally, here on the Georgia case, of course, allegations of impropriety leveraged in both the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=609.92s)]
*  press and also in a court filing against District Attorney Funny Willis for what what the opposing [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=616.16s)]
*  counsel had contended was an improper relationship with Nathan Wade, who's an attorney who's been an [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=622.72s)]
*  outside attorney brought into the office. Her filing today, basically, top line is, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=628.0s)]
*  yes, they had a relationship. No, it is an improper. It doesn't rise to any level of anything that [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=633.76s)]
*  should affect her involvement in the case. What do you think of her filing? It's 100 percent true [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=640.48s)]
*  under Georgia law. She needed to do it. You know, the law of these kinds of scandals is get it all [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  out early. The thing is, by now, there's sort of blood in the water. You have one of these, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=651.84s)]
*  you know, phony baloney special investigative commissions in Georgia. No, no, no other than [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=656.88s)]
*  Jim Jordan subpoenaed her today. McAfee is going to have a hearing on the 15th and oddly, even [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_61gUoSlPI&t=662.8000000000001s)]
