# Georgia teacher faces termination after reading book about acceptance to class
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I)
*  surrounded by dozens of educators and students. Governor Brian Kemp signed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=0.0s)]
*  seven bills into lock here at the Forsyth County Learning Center. Among [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=5.28s)]
*  the more controversial parental Bill of Rights and a bill that would ban so [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=9.92s)]
*  called divisive concepts from being taught in the classroom. The governor [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=14.76s)]
*  also signed bills to ban certain books considered obscene from school [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=18.8s)]
*  libraries. It's part of the moral panic around LGBTQ folks that is animating [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=23.28s)]
*  right wing lawmakers and activists across the country. Georgia's Republican [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=28.72s)]
*  dominated legislature and its governor enacted a package of culture war laws [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=31.96s)]
*  last year. Southern Poverty Law Center writes that collectively these laws are [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=36.4s)]
*  called the Protect Students Rights Act. They include a divisive concepts law, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=39.76s)]
*  apparent Bill of Rights, any harmful to minors law allows the removal or [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=44.18s)]
*  restriction of materials parents deem pornographic or otherwise harmful. The [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=48.76s)]
*  first bill tends to focus a lot of its explicit language on racial issues, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=54.0s)]
*  backlash to the panic around critical race theory. It also includes vague [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=57.68s)]
*  wording with room for interpretation around quote not advocating for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=62.36s)]
*  divisive concepts, whatever that means. Cobb County School District fifth grade [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=65.56s)]
*  teacher Katie Rinderly found out just how broadly that term can be applied [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  when she read the book My Shadow is Purple to her class. The publisher [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=75.08s)]
*  describes the book as quote heartwarming and inspiring book about being true to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=79.48s)]
*  yourself and moving beyond the gender binary. She is now on leave and faces [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=82.76s)]
*  termination proceedings. The first known case of a Georgia teacher being [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=87.36s)]
*  ousted under these laws. Katie Rinderly joins me now. It's great to have you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=90.76s)]
*  on the program. Thank you so much for joining us. Tell what happened to you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=95.64s)]
*  You tell me where do you teach and what kind of teaching do you do? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=98.94s)]
*  Yeah, I teach for Cobb County School District, more specifically do us [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=104.6s)]
*  elementary and I am the gifted specialist lead at our school. So I [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=108.64s)]
*  teach first through fifth grade gifted students. And this book, My Shadow is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=112.88s)]
*  Purple. How did you come about this book? What was the context for introducing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=119.0s)]
*  it to the class? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=122.8s)]
*  I had purchased this book from our school scholastic book fair in February [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=125.52s)]
*  of this year and in March, my fifth grade students had the opportunity to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  vote on various book titles, picture books and My Shadow is Purple had the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=134.8s)]
*  majority vote and it was selected to read as a class. So you bought it at the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=140.84s)]
*  school scholastic book fair. Of course, a lot of folks are familiar with that. I [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=145.8s)]
*  remember those those days very well. And then you had a sort of vote in the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=148.84s)]
*  class like a kind of what do we want to read together? They voted for this. You [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=153.2s)]
*  read them the book. I want to just read a little portion of it so people get a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  sense of the book. I was reading it today and it's about someone who feels [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=160.6s)]
*  not like they don't fit neatly into either gender of the two gender binaries [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=165.22s)]
*  as constructed. Some of my friends think I'm simply confused. But the thing I [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=170.52s)]
*  love most is not having to choose. Some tell me I'm blue. Only blue can be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  strong, but my mom's strong too. So I think they're wrong. Some tell me I'm [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=178.08s)]
*  pink because pinks the most caring, but dad's always crying and loving and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=182.0s)]
*  sharing. How did the book go over in the class? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=185.68s)]
*  Oh, it was wonderful. You know, students had the opportunity to discuss the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  books message that they've received, which was that of, you know, acceptance [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  of not only themselves, but of others. And you're truly valuing those [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=197.54s)]
*  differences within themselves and others and learning from them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  So it's a wonderful book. Yeah, I really liked it quite a bit. I mean, I look, I [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=207.34s)]
*  think we're disposed to like it, given what my view on gender is broadly. But [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=212.14s)]
*  it's not like I would not describe it as a militant book in any way or [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=216.38s)]
*  politically pointed. It's about someone who feels a little not like their self [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=220.7s)]
*  straddles different ways that we think about what's boyish or what's girlish or [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=225.5s)]
*  what's mannish and what's womanish and what's male and what's female. And [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=228.62s)]
*  they're trying to explore that. So what what went wrong? Like, how did you hear [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=231.1s)]
*  this? This was you were in trouble for this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=236.54s)]
*  So two days after the book had been read, I was received an email from my [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=240.7s)]
*  principal asking me to come to her office for a meeting and also received [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=245.42s)]
*  an email from a parent of a fifth grade student who also works in the district. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=249.5s)]
*  And it was brought to my attention that this book was deemed divisive and there [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  would be an investigation to follow. So on Monday, March 13th, I was placed on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=259.06s)]
*  administrative leave with pay. And, you know, that continued until May 5th when [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=264.38s)]
*  the district let me know that they would be moving for termination. So is it your [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=269.98s)]
*  understanding this was initiated by a parental complaint was what initiated [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=273.98s)]
*  this proceeding? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=277.58s)]
*  Correct, yes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=279.62s)]
*  And that complaint was pursuant to the new Georgia law that passed with [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=281.18s)]
*  sanctions for teachers if they introduced divisive concepts? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=286.38s)]
*  Yes. This was very vague with how this book was brought to their attention. The [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=290.5s)]
*  district and my principal was not ever able to describe to me or define how [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=297.82s)]
*  this book was divisive or what was so divisive about it. You know, this is a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  book that is inclusive, not divisive. And, you know, children are especially [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=307.14s)]
*  harmed when they're not made to feel celebrated and validated for who they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  are and all that they bring with them into our classroom. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  The school district has now initiated what will be a sort of termination [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=322.46s)]
*  tribunal. I understand that there's a process here for your possible [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=326.97999999999996s)]
*  termination. I want to just read for you the statement from the Cobb County [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=331.06s)]
*  School District and says without getting into the specifics of the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=334.46s)]
*  personnel investigation, the district is confident this action, meaning their [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  termination proceedings, is appropriate considering the entirety of the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=341.06s)]
*  teachers behavior in history. The district remains committed to strictly [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  enforcing all board policy and the law. What do you say to that? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=348.26s)]
*  I say that I have 10 years of incredible evaluations. I'm a leader [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=353.78s)]
*  within our school and within the district, and I think that speaks for [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=357.9s)]
*  itself. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=361.46s)]
*  Um, what? What is your understanding of why you have found yourself in this [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=363.1s)]
*  position? Like you read a book. Did you know when you're reading it like, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  Oh, I don't know about this. This is edgy or I don't know if this is [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  legally dubious. Where was it? Hey, the kids. This is a great book. The kids [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  want to read it. Let's read it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=380.3s)]
*  Right, exactly. So in my opinion, these are complaints that are brought [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=382.94s)]
*  that are truly rooted in, you know, bias and prejudice, and they're not [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=389.06s)]
*  centering students, you know, for what a learning environment should be and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=393.86s)]
*  how students learn best. Um, this is about a book that, you know, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=400.06s)]
*  validate students, but also empowers them to learn how to communicate and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=407.82s)]
*  collaborate with one another and to engage in discourse that's necessary [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=411.90000000000003s)]
*  for them to be able to collaborate and communicate with one another. So I [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=417.02s)]
*  truly think that students are not placed at the center of all of this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=423.26s)]
*  It is these vague laws that truly chill education, chill educators, um, and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  limit the students ability to actually have an environment where they are [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=436.53999999999996s)]
*  able to freely learn. The book is called my shadow is purple. I read it [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=441.14s)]
*  today and I thought it was great. Um, and I thought it was, as you said, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=445.22s)]
*  inclusive and about understanding and about maybe not fitting into the ways [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  that people think you should be, but how that's okay. Um, and Katie [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=454.18s)]
*  Rinderly, who's a teacher down there in Cub County, Georgia, now facing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  possible termination for the violation of reading that book under Georgia [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=461.98s)]
*  state law. Katie Rinderly, thank you so much for telling us your story [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=466.14000000000004s)]
*  tonight. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rGR6JZH1I&t=468.58000000000004s)]
