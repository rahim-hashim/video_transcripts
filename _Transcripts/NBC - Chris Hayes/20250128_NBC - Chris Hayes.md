# ‘Focus is power’: Trump doesn’t want you to pay attention to this, says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM)
*  So far, the experience of this first week of Donald Trump has been an awfully familiar one, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=0.0s)]
*  a kind of sensory bombardment, just being overwhelmed by stimuli, unable to focus, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=4.64s)]
*  a kind of total attentional domination. This has been Donald Trump's modus operandi since 2015. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=10.96s)]
*  Through his own, I think, personal psychological brokenness, he instinctively gets that in the age [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=19.44s)]
*  we live in, the attention age, that attention is the most valuable resource. Get enough of it and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=26.08s)]
*  you command fortunes, can dominate politics, and for that reason you pursue it at all costs even. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=32.08s)]
*  And this is really important, even if it means courting, even embracing negative attention [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=37.92s)]
*  and conflict and hatred, millions of people genuinely hating you. It is not just Trump's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=43.2s)]
*  dominance of our public life that makes us feel this way, though. This insistent beckoning call [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=50.4s)]
*  of the phones and the screens that lure our attention almost against our will is now a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=57.12s)]
*  fixture of our interior and personal lives as well, down to even our most intimate moments. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  We're all subjected to a kind of dominion from the online platforms that were represented in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=68.0s)]
*  person by the people who stood on the very stage next to Donald Trump at his inauguration, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=73.84s)]
*  from Elon Musk's ex to Meta to Google and Amazon to a certain extent and beyond. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=78.96s)]
*  The entirety right now of our private, social, and political lives is dominated by this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=84.24s)]
*  ever more competitive pursuit of our attention. And those who wish to extract it for a value [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  are cracking into our very minds to take it. That reality is the thesis of my new book, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  The Sirens Call, How Attention Became the World's Most Endangerous Resource. It is finally out [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=105.92s)]
*  and available for you to read today. I have a physical copy, which is very fun. The book [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=111.28s)]
*  I've been working on for the last few years centers around the idea that what we pay attention to at [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=117.84s)]
*  any given moment is really the substance of life. It's just about the most precious resource we have. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=122.0s)]
*  When it is aggregated and pooled at scale over billions of users worldwide, it becomes a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  treasured commodity both for corporations and for politicians. And the mechanisms they now deploy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=135.04s)]
*  with increasing sophistication, using our own biological wiring to compel our attention [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  like the sirens tried to lure Odysseus, has created this signature feeling of alienation [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=146.56s)]
*  that I think is the pervasive mood of our times. A feeling that something should be within us and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=155.28s)]
*  under our control is now outside of us and in someone else's control. All of this, I think, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=161.04s)]
*  actually has really big implications for covering this Trump administration. I know there's lots of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=167.04s)]
*  viewers and folks who are tired of paying attention to Donald Trump, I having done it for 10 years in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=171.2s)]
*  one of them. One of the most important lessons I've come to in writing the book is this, that in a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=177.04s)]
*  distracted age, focus is power. Focus is power. Having an inability to focus is giving away power. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=182.56s)]
*  And that's easier said than done. It is something that, honest to God, we wrestle with every day and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=193.12s)]
*  we've been wrestling with for years, especially with Trump. Here's an example. I think right now [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=198.24s)]
*  it's safe to say there are things he wants people to pay attention to. For instance, the ICE raids [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=203.84s)]
*  that he is sending TV's Dr. Phil on ride-alongs with. And there are things that he does not really [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=210.08s)]
*  want people to pay attention to. For example, firing most of the government's inspectors general, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  top federal watchdogs, in the middle of a Friday night. No Dr. Phil ride-along. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, as improbable and maddening as Trump's particular political success [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  has been for so many reasons, he isn't an omnipotent. He's not a colossus. The politics [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=234.72s)]
*  that he embodies, this obsession with attention, also comes with huge vulnerabilities. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=241.36s)]
*  Because he's so obsessed with attention, because he's willing to attract a lot of negative [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=247.12s)]
*  attention and outrage and controversy and blow back, don't forget for a second that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=252.24s)]
*  tens of millions of people find all of it utterly off-putting. He won the first time through an [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=257.44s)]
*  electoral college hat trick while losing the popular vote by millions. The second time he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=264.16s)]
*  lost, even though he was the incumbent, and incumbents around the world were doing well [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=268.24s)]
*  during COVID, the last time he won a fairly narrow victory. But he entered this term with [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  lower approval than almost any other new president recent memory. The popularity of this form of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=276.0s)]
*  denomination is not a given. It's defeatable. But it does require us to be aware and intentional [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  about where we put our attention. And that's my job with this show, all of our jobs in this era, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=289.6s)]
*  is to work to maintain focus and to keep focus on things that matter and to stay with them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  And my promise to you is that's the role we're going to try to play as we go through this chaotic [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=304.88s)]
*  maelstrom in which he and his big tech oligarchs are attempting this omnipresent assault on our [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  attentional faculties in public life and in every other moment in between. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=316.96s)]
*  You may have seen me discussing all this and the book I've been getting around [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=322.88s)]
*  last week. In the past few days, I was on Colbert, which is great, on Ezra Klein's podcast, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=326.96s)]
*  and Katie Couric I talked to, and a whole bunch of people. In fact, in a new episode of my podcast, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  Why Is This Happening?, you can actually hear me read a chapter from the book, the first chapter, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=337.2s)]
*  The Sirens Call. I did the whole audiobook, and you can, for free, listen. You just scan the QR [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=342.24s)]
*  code on your screen to listen to that chapter now. I'm also hitting the road for live conversations [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=347.44s)]
*  about the book. I'm really excited. For instance, Jen Psaki, my good friend and colleague, is going [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=352.8s)]
*  to join me for discussion at Sixth and I in D.C. tomorrow night. There's still a few tickets [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=357.6s)]
*  available for that. Then I'll be with Lawrence Lessig at First Parish Church in Boston on Friday [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=362.72s)]
*  evening. And I'll be with the New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, at the Temple Emanuel [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=368.4s)]
*  Stryker Center in New York on Saturday night. And that is just the start of the tour. There's a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=373.2s)]
*  bunch of other dates. If you're interested in any of them, you can scan the QR code on your screen [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=378.32s)]
*  for tickets. You'll also find links to Buy Sirens Call in hardcover or for your e-reader or as an [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=383.2s)]
*  audiobook I narrate. And remember, this is really important. You can always just ask your local [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=389.84s)]
*  library to order the book if they don't have it. Libraries are amazing. I hope to see a bunch of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=395.92s)]
*  you in the coming weeks. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8vQb-JU_NM&t=401.28000000000003s)]
