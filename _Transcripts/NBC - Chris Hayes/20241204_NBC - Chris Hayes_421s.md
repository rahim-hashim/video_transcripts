# Manhunt continues after 'targeted attack' on UnitedHealthcare CEO
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E)
*  There is an ongoing and active manhunt here in New York City for a gunman who shot and killed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=0.0s)]
*  Brian Thompson, CEO of the UnitedHealthcare, one of the nation's largest insurers, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=5.12s)]
*  this morning outside of a very crowded, busy hotel in midtown Manhattan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=9.28s)]
*  Now we do have security footage of the incident. I'm going to show it to you, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=14.8s)]
*  but we are of course going to freeze it right before the actual shooting occurs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=18.0s)]
*  At 6 46 a.m. Thompson, the man in the blue jacket, you see, whoa, as walking near the New York Hilton [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=22.56s)]
*  Hotel when a gunman approached from behind and as you see there shot Thompson in the back. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=29.2s)]
*  Gunman continued to fire at one point his gun appearing to jam. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=34.56s)]
*  The man cleared the jam and fired again. The shooter fled the scene first on foot, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=38.24s)]
*  then on bike, at least according to NYPD. Police later released these security camera photos, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=43.04s)]
*  apparently shot in nearby Starbucks before the shooting, showing part of the assailant's face [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=48.72s)]
*  obscured by the mask and hoodie. It's nearly 14 hours after the attack. There's much we still [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=53.44s)]
*  do not know. Earlier today, New York police held a press conference and called this a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=58.24s)]
*  brazen targeted attack where the gunman waited for his intended target. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=62.72s)]
*  I want to be clear. At this time, every indication is that this was a premeditated, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=68.56s)]
*  preplanned, targeted attack. The motive for this murder currently is unknown, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=76.08s)]
*  but based on the evidence we have so far, it does appear that the victim was specifically targeted, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=81.76s)]
*  but at this point we do not know why. This does not appear to be a random act of violence. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=87.36s)]
*  Tom Winters, the NBC News National Law Enforcement and Intelligence Correspondent, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=93.2s)]
*  he joins me now. Tom, I got to say my word. I mean, just in terms of where it happened, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=96.64s)]
*  the audacity of it, the barbarity of it, and the fact that it happened in such a crowded spot of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=101.84s)]
*  the city. It was 6.30 in the morning. Yeah, you think 6.30 in the morning and who's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=108.64s)]
*  going to be on the streets, but in that part of town, as you and I were just discussing in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  break, it is busy at that hour in the morning. That's a very busy hotel, the Hilton Hotel, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=116.16s)]
*  where he was apparently on his way to speak at a conference at 8 a.m. There's an awful lot of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=120.72s)]
*  tourists that are in the area. This is a huge part of the Christmas season here in New York City. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=126.0s)]
*  This was called a gridlock alert day, so people can't move around even at 7, 8 in the morning. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=131.6s)]
*  This morning it was very difficult to drive around town. Points to one of the things that came up in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  the course of this, I think that is rather important, the fact that he took a bike. That [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=140.0s)]
*  was the exact way to get out of this area at that hour to be able to get at least somewhat of a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=144.88s)]
*  head start on the police department. And so frankly, got lucky this alleged shooter, this suspect [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=149.92s)]
*  that he didn't bump into an NYPD officer just given how many officers are out there in midtown [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=156.4s)]
*  when this happened. So yes, this is somebody who clearly knew where this health executive was coming [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=161.68s)]
*  from, the hotel he was staying at, where he was going to, a general sense of what time that might [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  occur. So it definitely points to some planning ahead of time. It was an e-bike that he had, but [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=172.88s)]
*  it was not a city bike, so not something that could be immediately tracked. And so I think there's a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=178.16s)]
*  lot of questions, Sonny, about where he's going to go. Oh, that's interesting. You resolved one of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=182.16s)]
*  the details because I had seen there had been reporting there was a city bike and then Lyft, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=185.28s)]
*  which runs the city bike programs, that that was not our bike. So it does appear to be an e-bike [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=189.12s)]
*  that he got away with. Now, there was, I saw a number of eyewitnesses interview there. I mean, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=193.92s)]
*  the scene must have been shocking there. And a bunch of people who saw him lingering for a long [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=200.08s)]
*  time. Right, so he was lingering for a long time. But as you see here in the video, I mean, he does [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=205.52s)]
*  it kind of in a perfect setup for him. He's got the camera to his back. He's got him in front of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=209.52s)]
*  him, so there's no opportunity for Thompson to realize that he's behind him. This is a person [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=214.56s)]
*  who is married. He's got two children, so obviously a very difficult thing, Chris, for his family. And [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  he's got what appears to be some sort of a suppressor on the gun, which may have led to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=227.28s)]
*  a jamming. But that's going to obviously quiet this sound and not ricochet through the canyons [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=231.04s)]
*  of Manhattan at that hour. So definitely some planning here. He's wearing a mask. The images [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=236.16s)]
*  that we saw that were taken, that was from prior to the shooting, a little bit more clear tonight, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=241.04s)]
*  but probably not enough face showing for the NYPD facial recognition unit to be able to do its work. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=245.28s)]
*  And so, yes, at this hour, still some solid leads that are being followed. But I don't think the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=251.04s)]
*  Detective Bureau has keyed in on exactly where this is going to go yet. Maybe this is a dumb and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=256.88s)]
*  naive question, but I'll ask it. I mean, I think my first reaction when I saw this had happened was [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  like, there's no way this person can get away with this. Like in this day and age with the amount of, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=266.4s)]
*  the insane amount of surveillance technology, digital footprints of everyone, the amount of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=271.76s)]
*  cameras that are all over the city covering every inch, you can't shoot someone in the middle of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=278.56s)]
*  midtown and ride off on a bike. I mean, how confident, I guess, of the NYPD that they will [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=284.8s)]
*  find the suspect. I think there's a strong feeling that at some point they will get to a resolution [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=290.56s)]
*  here that will result in handcuffs. And just knowing to these days how they're able to do [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=294.08s)]
*  these investigations, how they're able to work backwards. I mean, the whole key to this investigation [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=298.8s)]
*  is going to be the timeline. And it's not just the moment of the shooting and the moments afterwards [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=302.88s)]
*  and where he goes to 55th Street, picks up this bike that he apparently is waiting there, zooms up [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=306.64s)]
*  6th Avenue, goes into Central Park. That they've got. Now you want to start tracing backwards. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=311.6s)]
*  Where was he? Does he make a mistake? Does he drop that mask at some point? All of those types [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  of things come into play. To your point, I completely agree with you. I cannot remember [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=321.44s)]
*  the last high profile crime in midtown that was not solved. Because not only do you have NYPD [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=326.16s)]
*  cameras, they're going to work with the hotels, they're going to work with the restaurants. They [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=331.12s)]
*  freely exchange that type of video. Nobody wants this in the heart of New York City. They're going [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=334.88s)]
*  to get that information and be able to back it up. There were some reporting today, interviews with [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=339.28s)]
*  the widow for Mr. Thompson saying that he had received threats. But as of now, no. Earlier [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=343.44s)]
*  today, obviously, as you saw in the clip we played, there was no determination of a motive. And I [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  imagine that remains the case until they have further identification of the suspect. That's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=354.4s)]
*  right. That's the chief of detectives speaking. There was a cell phone that was recovered. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  Unclear if that is specifically involving the suspect or if there's anything on there that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  could be helpful. In this day and age, if there was any sort of tracking of a cell phone, what they [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=366.56s)]
*  can do with the cell site analysis, both the NYPD and the FBI even if needed, is fairly incredible. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=371.2s)]
*  So the information on that phone obviously could be helpful tracking back those threats. So if [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=377.92s)]
*  they're able to go back and say what types of threats did he get, could that point us in the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=382.48s)]
*  direction? Again, Chris, all the type of work that you know that's going on, yes, it does sound a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=386.88s)]
*  little CSI to us here sitting here and talking about it tonight, but it is the actual work that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=391.6s)]
*  they're doing. Yeah, I imagine there's people working around the clock on this. Tom Winter, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=396.0s)]
*  as always, thank you. You got it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SrhscSBu9E&t=399.04s)]
