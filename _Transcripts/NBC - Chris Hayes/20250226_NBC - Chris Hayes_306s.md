# Gov. Beshear warns against GOP Medicaid cuts: 'It would be a betrayal'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48)
*  Yesterday during our show, the House narrowly, narrowly passed a Republican budget resolution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=0.0s)]
*  that calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, the bulk of that going to the richest folks, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=5.2s)]
*  and a $2 trillion reduction in federal spending over the course of the decade. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=11.48s)]
*  Now, it doesn't mention Medicaid by name, but it directs the House Energy and Commerce [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=15.36s)]
*  Committee to cut $880 billion from programs it oversees, which, let me tell you, cannot [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  be achieved without slashing Medicaid. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=26.02s)]
*  It's a program that provides health coverage to 72 million poor and disabled Americans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=29.4s)]
*  Simply put, they are going to cut taxes for really, really rich people like Elon Musk [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=34.08s)]
*  and others and corporations by cutting health care for the poorest and neediest people in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=39.16s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=43.36s)]
*  That's simple. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=44.36s)]
*  It's a pretty politically dangerous approach for Republicans because, well, a lot of their [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  voters are on Medicaid. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=49.0s)]
*  In fact, in Kentucky, which Trump won by about 31%, over 1.4 million people are enrolled [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=50.68s)]
*  in Medicaid. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=57.0s)]
*  That comes out to nearly a third of the state's population. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=58.16s)]
*  Medicaid also covers care for 638,000 children, which is more than half of the children in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=61.63999999999999s)]
*  the whole state. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=67.36s)]
*  It is because of Medicaid that Kentucky is one of the lowest uninsured rates in the nation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  Andy Beshear is the Democratic governor of Kentucky, and he joins me now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=74.96s)]
*  Governor, it's good to have you on the program. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  First, just as someone who is the governor of a state where there are a lot of folks [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=80.19999999999999s)]
*  on Medicaid that did vote for Donald Trump overwhelmingly in the presidential election, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=85.12s)]
*  what would it mean for your state if we saw drastic cuts like what appear to be on the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  table? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  It would be devastating, and it would be a betrayal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you think about the fact that the people we love most in life are our kids and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  our parents. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Half of Kentucky's kids are covered by Medicaid, and 70% of long-term care costs in Kentucky [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=105.44s)]
*  are covered by Medicaid. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=111.68s)]
*  Those are the people that we love the most and who are the most vulnerable who would [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=114.06s)]
*  bear the burden of these cuts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=118.52s)]
*  It would also devastate rural health care. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=121.36s)]
*  Rural hospitals will close around the country, and then our people will have to drive a couple [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=124.12s)]
*  hours to a big city just to see the same doctor or nurse that was laid off in their hometown [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=129.02s)]
*  because of cuts to Medicaid. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=136.1s)]
*  It's a mistake. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  The American people will react and will react strongly, and I hope Congress doesn't go there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=140.28s)]
*  You have managed to win election twice in a state that has gone for Republicans at the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=146.32s)]
*  national level and the Senate seats. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=151.44s)]
*  If you had a kind of referendum in the state of Kentucky, it's a counterfactual, but I [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=156.36s)]
*  trust you on this, to cut a bunch of Medicaid from the state, how do you think it would [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=160.26s)]
*  do in your state? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=166.0s)]
*  Well, I wish we had some referendums in our state, and it would fail, and it would fail [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=167.72s)]
*  significantly. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=172.96s)]
*  Health care is a basic human right, and in Kentucky, we're getting healthier. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=174.64s)]
*  We've had some real challenges in the past, from heart disease to lung cancer to diabetes, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=179.36s)]
*  and we want the people that we love and care about to get the help that they need. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=184.76s)]
*  But here's the other thing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=188.8s)]
*  Medicaid coverage works. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=190.84s)]
*  Let's look at our drug epidemic, where Kentucky and maybe West Virginia and Ohio got hit first [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=192.98s)]
*  and got hit hardest. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=198.5s)]
*  Well, for the last two years, we've seen overdose deaths go down in Kentucky, and what recovery [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=199.7s)]
*  centers will say is when we started covering recovery and treatment in Medicaid, everything [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  changed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=211.33999999999997s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=212.38s)]
*  Those are people that are alive today, our brothers, sisters, friends, parents, and kids, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=213.38s)]
*  because of the coverage that Medicaid provides. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=218.98s)]
*  Or think about the economic impact. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=221.7s)]
*  I talked about rural health care, but it's all of health care. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  We won't have the same number of doctors, nurses, orderlies, people working in hospitals. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  You won't have the number of options you have right now to go into the same-day clinics [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=233.89999999999998s)]
*  or the walk-in clinics. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  This will be more challenging for all of America that will bear the brunt of it, and everyone's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=242.14s)]
*  access will be reduced because of it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=246.98s)]
*  I believe that at the end of the day, the things that the American people care about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=249.62s)]
*  the most are their job and whether they make enough to support their family, the roads [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=253.66s)]
*  and bridges they drive on every day, the schools they drop their kids off at, the safety in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=258.62s)]
*  their community, and their next doctor's appointment for themselves, their kids, or their parents. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=263.74s)]
*  And this will complicate that significantly, make it harder on the American people, and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=270.1s)]
*  I think people will feel betrayed by having health care options taken away from them and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=276.62s)]
*  making their life just tougher than it already is. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Civy2do48&t=282.58s)]
