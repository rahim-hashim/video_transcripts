# WaPo: DOJ resisted investigating Trump’s actions on Jan. 6 for over a year
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8)
*  Good evening from Washington, D.C. I'm Mehdi Hasan in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, a federal judge ordered Donald J. Trump not to speak publicly about evidence in the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=4.44s)]
*  classified documents case brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith earlier [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=11.56s)]
*  this month. The order prohibits the ex-president from keeping or crucially sharing on social [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=15.88s)]
*  media the evidence that federal investigators will turn over to his legal team as part of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=21.36s)]
*  the discovery process. Trump will also only have access to the materials, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=26.04s)]
*  under the direct supervision of his lawyers. And the judge warned that if he violates these [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=30.28s)]
*  rules, Trump could face contempt of court or other civil or criminal sanctions. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=35.36s)]
*  Now, please forgive me while I laugh my head off at the idea of Donald Trump promising not to post [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=40.12s)]
*  anything on social media. What a promise that will be. As we all know, he has a, shall we say, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=47.16s)]
*  difficult time keeping his mouth shut, as well as a long history of abusing and threatening judges, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=52.08s)]
*  prosecutors and witnesses in various cases against him. And I'm not even sure what the court really [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  expects to do if he does reveal something publicly. Are they really going to, I don't know, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=63.16s)]
*  indict him again? But this is where we are. As the first ever federal indictment of a former [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=67.32s)]
*  president proceeds, the wheels of this case are finally in motion and Donald Trump will be tried [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=73.0s)]
*  on 37 criminal counts. Now, the big question is, when will that happen? Special counsel Jack Smith [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=78.72s)]
*  promised to seek a speedy trial. But will that begin before the presidential election next year? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Would Trump be front runner for the Republican nomination? Could the ex-president be tried and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=91.72s)]
*  convicted on federal criminal charges before November of 2024, less than a year and a half [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=97.16s)]
*  from now? Or is it too late? The consensus emerging from legal experts is that the window has passed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=102.48s)]
*  As former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti writes in Politico, quote, it would take a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=110.16s)]
*  Herculean effort to bring this to trial next year. And Judge Aline Cannon has essentially totaled [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=115.08s)]
*  control over the schedule for the trial of a man who appointed her to the bench and who she has [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  favored in the past. As Donald Trump's former acting attorney general explained. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=126.32s)]
*  This isn't going to go to trial before the general election in 2024 if Donald Trump is the Republican [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=130.76s)]
*  nominee. There's no way that Donald Trump, while he runs for president, is going to be able to prepare [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=138.28s)]
*  for this trial in a meaningful way. And so I'm sure Judge is going to be very sympathetic to his [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  requests to extend it beyond the political campaign that he currently finds himself in. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  But we didn't need to be in this position with the clock rapidly counting down in this way. We could [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=152.84s)]
*  have seen the ex-president indicted much sooner than he was if the Department of Justice had just [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=160.04s)]
*  moved faster. Some of us said that and we were shouted down. Trust the process. Trust the DOJ. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=167.0s)]
*  Trust Merrick Garland. Well, according to explosive new reporting out today from the Washington Post, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=173.0s)]
*  for more than a year the FBI resisted opening the other major federal investigation into Donald [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=179.24s)]
*  Trump related to his role on January the 6th while the top DOJ leaders dragged their feet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Quote, awareness about appearing partisan, institutional caution and clashes over how much [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=190.28s)]
*  evidence was sufficient to investigate the actions of Trump and those around him all contributed to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=196.28s)]
*  the slow pace. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  charted a cautious course aimed at restoring public trust in the department while some [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=206.4s)]
*  prosecutors below them chafed feeling top officials were shying away from looking at [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=211.52s)]
*  evidence of potential crimes by Trump and those close to him, the post found. And inside the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=215.8s)]
*  Justice Department some have complained that the Attorney General's determination to steer clear of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=221.56s)]
*  any claims of political motive has chilled efforts to investigate the former president. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=226.4s)]
*  You couldn't use the T word, said one former justice official briefed on prosecutors discussions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=230.96s)]
*  You couldn't use the T word, the T word being the name of the man who incited a violent insurrection [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=236.96s)]
*  in order to try and overturn an election and stay in office. Now Merrick Garland's confirmation as [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=243.8s)]
*  Attorney General in 2021 was cheered on by so many liberals, many of whom saw it as a slap in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=249.96s)]
*  face to Republicans who had successfully blocked Garland's earlier nomination to the Supreme Court. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=255.82s)]
*  But again, some of us at the time questioned if he was the right person for this job and we feel [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=261.04s)]
*  sadly vindicated by this Washington Post reporting today. It didn't need to take so long to get a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=267.72s)]
*  federal indictment of Donald J. Trump. More than two years into this administration and that too [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=274.56s)]
*  for mishandling classified documents and not for inciting an insurrection, we're still waiting on [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=279.36s)]
*  the DOJ and on the special counsel to hold Trump accountable for that. History will have to reckon [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  with whether Merrick Garland was the right man for this moment and what could have been had he and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=291.52s)]
*  his DOJ not slow walk the investigation into Donald J. Trump. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgDXo5pcd8&t=297.44s)]
