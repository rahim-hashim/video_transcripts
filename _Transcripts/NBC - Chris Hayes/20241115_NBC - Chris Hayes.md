Video Description: Former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on RFK Jr. being tapped for the top U.S. health role: “Having somebody with the title of Secretary of Health and Human Services say in very definitive terms, ‘there is no vaccine that's safe and effective,’ actually will cause death. It is a life and death situation. And it is terrifying, not only in this country, but across the globe.”

# 'Terrifying' Ex-HHS Secretary calls RFK Jr. pick 'life or death situation'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE)
*  I'm joined now by the former Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Obama [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=0.0s)]
*  administration and former governor of Kansas, Kathleen Sebelius. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=3.64s)]
*  I want to start, Governor, on this point about the sort of remarkable pivot that's happened [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  since you were there in the Obama administration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  On these questions of additives in foods, use of pesticides, the industrial food production [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=15.8s)]
*  system, the regulation thereof, European models, I mean, Europe is a much more restrictive [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=21.72s)]
*  regime on this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=26.56s)]
*  And the idea that conservatives who used to berate Michelle Obama for planting her organic [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=28.0s)]
*  garden or make fun of people who wanted to ban huge drinks are now suddenly, I guess, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=32.44s)]
*  on board with this? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=37.32s)]
*  Well, Chris, I think that's a good news story, right? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=38.32s)]
*  Yes, I guess so. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Welcome to Converse, yes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=46.64s)]
*  You bet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=48.92s)]
*  It takes them a while, but maybe they're catching up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=49.92s)]
*  Michelle Obama was clearly ahead of her time, but identifying a crisis in our children, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=53.72s)]
*  that too many children were overweight and obese, tied directly to the foods that they [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  ate and the food supplied to them by our health system and by schools. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=65.56s)]
*  And so she wanted to do something about it and was roundly critiqued. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=71.84s)]
*  But these guys are finally catching up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=76.8s)]
*  And I'd say that's good. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=80.68s)]
*  It isn't the nutrition department at the FDA. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=82.12s)]
*  I would say that there's a battle even within the government of people who want to move [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  forward. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=91.84s)]
*  The FDA comes at things from a public health standpoint. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=92.84s)]
*  The Department of Agriculture, on the other hand, often is representing and supporting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  industries that deal with corn syrup and food additives and issues. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=102.4s)]
*  So there's a conflict, but it's hardly the FDA nutrition department who is responsible. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=111.52s)]
*  I've worked with those folks and they're brilliant. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=118.96s)]
*  Yes, the USDA, I think, is sort of the more, you know, the food triangle, the, hey, we [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  just discovered that you need nine cups of sugar and 15 sticks of butter a day kind of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=126.44s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=129.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm joking, that's hyperbole. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=130.96s)]
*  But I want to talk about the vaccine situation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=134.56s)]
*  And I want to talk in real terms before we even get to that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=137.36s)]
*  It's like people, I think 99% of people, even incredibly in tune and adept consumers of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=140.24s)]
*  news information are like HHS, Health, Human Services, like what is that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  Like it's an enormous, sprawling organization that does a million things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=151.44000000000003s)]
*  Like can you just start with just a top line version of what it really means to run that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  agency, which you did? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=161.12s)]
*  Well, HHS is one of the biggest domestic agencies in the country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=162.64s)]
*  It, I'd say it touches Americans from cradle to grave. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  So yes, people know about the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  About 25 cents of every consumer dollar is a product regulated by the FDA. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  NIH, the National Institutes of Health, is the gold standard in the world for scientific [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  research. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=190.72s)]
*  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is the public health agency that everyone [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=191.8s)]
*  around the globe wants to emulate and is responsible for our public health. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=198.32s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid and marketplaces supply health insurance to about a third to a half [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=203.2s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=209.84s)]
*  There's mental health services. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=212.76s)]
*  There's the Department on Aging. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=214.86s)]
*  There's unaccompanied kids. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=216.44s)]
*  There are children and family services. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=217.44s)]
*  It's a broad agency. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  HHS sends more money to states than all the other domestic agencies combined. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=222.4s)]
*  So it has a very intimate partnership with state government on block grants, on mental [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=229.44s)]
*  health, on running child care and Head Start programs, on all the insurance policies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  So we have no idea what Bobby Kennedy Jr. feels about any of that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=242.88s)]
*  What's terrifying is what we know about his views on very important health achievements. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  As you said, in the last 50 years, there's no greater achievement than the vaccine improvements. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=256.08s)]
*  I'm old enough that I was in line in kindergarten and was a sugar cube kid who was in the test [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=262.24s)]
*  group for the polio vaccine, which made a dramatic difference. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=270.12s)]
*  My parents' best friend's wife ended up in an iron lung with polio. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=275.56s)]
*  I mean, these are life and death conditions that have been virtually eliminated in the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=280.72s)]
*  United States until people became hesitant to take the vaccines that have been safe and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=285.68s)]
*  effective for 50 years. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=292.76s)]
*  So having somebody with the title of Secretary of Health and Human Services say in very [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=297.04s)]
*  definitive terms, there is no vaccine that's safe and effective actually will cause death. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=305.4s)]
*  It is a life and death situation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  And it is terrifying not only in this country, but across the globe. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=314.55999999999995s)]
*  Kathleen Sebelius, who ran HHS, which, as you heard, is a sprawling out. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=320.2s)]
*  I mean, CMS, Medicare Medicaid Services, basically is like the boiler room for the entire [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  hospital system in the entire country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=329.55999999999995s)]
*  And I mean, it's truly an enormously consequential agency. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=331.68s)]
*  Thank you for sharing a little time and perspective with us tonight. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1XyzLFtJE&t=337.68s)]
