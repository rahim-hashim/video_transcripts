# Chris Hayes Biden is leaving a ‘disgraceful legacy’ on Gaza
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20)
*  Since the end of the last world war there have been basically two kind of competing visions of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=0.0s)]
*  America's role in the world at least among the two major parties [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=5.68s)]
*  There's an international liberal international view right that the human rights should matter that there should be a uniform standard globally that applies to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=8.3s)]
*  Every nation including us the US and our allies a regime of international norms and most importantly international law like real international law [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=15.76s)]
*  That the US could shape and strengthen now to be clear. I wasn't born yesterday. I'm not completely naive [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=23.44s)]
*  Yes, that standard is one that is very very often only given lip service to while the US per sure pursues pure power politics [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  But it is a meaningful and important standard as is the aspiration towards reaching it and the people that advocate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=38.44s)]
*  Holding it as a standard. So that's one vision and then there's a kind of standard reactionary vision right wing vision, which is that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=44.68s)]
*  Might makes right [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=52.16s)]
*  Universal norms or fictions that can never really constrain us were the greatest country on earth [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=53.76s)]
*  And because we are the greatest nation [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=57.6s)]
*  It's just definitionally impossible for us or our allies to be on the wrong side of international law, which doesn't exist [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=59.32s)]
*  And that view is strong and has a very long tradition [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=66.2s)]
*  You can say it might have peaked or reached its apogee in the Cold War under Henry Kissinger [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=70.44s)]
*  Who sold successive administrations on dirty wars and proxy wars? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=75.48s)]
*  funding training and arming right-wing militaries to oppose left-wing governments or activists [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=79.72s)]
*  He enabled deadly terror in Chile and Argentina and South Africa and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=85.46s)]
*  Indonesia where to be clear Kissinger's support for a right-wing dictator led to the genocide of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=90.46s)]
*  200,000 East Timorese people by a US equipped army one of the great moral stains of US foreign policy in the last 60 years [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=97.74s)]
*  in El Salvador where US back forces fueled a civil war and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=106.06s)]
*  Murdered Catholic bishops Catholic nuns and social workers and outraged that led the Carter administration to suspend military aid to the nation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=110.98s)]
*  And as the Cold War finally wound down [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  There was one lawmaker who made an indelible contribution to rolling back these abuses and attempting again attempting [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  To set a standard for American behavior abroad and the behavior of our allies that we armed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  That was senator Pat Leahy Democrat of Vermont in 1997 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  so called Leahy law [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=140.9s)]
*  Expands our current law and seeks to ensure the United States assistance does not go to individuals [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=143.86s)]
*  Who abuse human rights to do everything possible to assure that in our efforts to support foreign security forces? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=151.3s)]
*  That we respect human rights. We also prevent those who abuse human rights from receiving our assistance [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  Seems straightforward Leahy law barred the Pentagon and the Department of State from transferring US arms to countries that we thought were committing human rights abuses and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=165.26s)]
*  That is what I keep thinking of as I process the news that on the way out the door [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  The Biden administration is going to transfer eight billion dollars more in weapons to Israel [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=178.82s)]
*  Including fighter jets and attack helicopters bombs warheads and artillery shells eight million dollars in weaponry [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=184.66s)]
*  Given over to an ally waging what I think can only be described as total war in Gaza [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=191.66s)]
*  that has according to I think multiple independent experts and reports reporters and NGOs been committing war crimes and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  ethnic cleansing according to a former Israeli defense minister [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=205.5s)]
*  where Israeli soldiers say they have been ordered to target and kill innocents arbitrarily including children and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=209.94s)]
*  That they have used Palestinians as human shields for their operations in Gaza [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  as [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=220.54s)]
*  whistleblowers and detainees say the Israeli authorities regularly torture [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=221.74s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners the UN says Israel is using using starvation as a strategy in Gaza [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=226.66s)]
*  Amnesty International says Israel is committing a genocide [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=232.86s)]
*  Dozens of doctors nurses and paramedics who volunteered in Gaza and were there and saw up close [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=237.5s)]
*  Told the New York Times they'd seen as you see the images there in front of you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=243.54s)]
*  multiple children [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=248.14s)]
*  who were shot in the head or chest in the head or chest bullets and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=250.14s)]
*  They even brought back the x-rays you're seeing right now to prove it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=255.66s)]
*  So people would believe that they had seen children with bullets lodged in their skulls [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=259.41999999999996s)]
*  As congresswoman Katie Porter pointed out in a house hearing last year the US ban on arms transfers to human rights abusers the lady law [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=265.3s)]
*  Has one big exception? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=272.02s)]
*  State Department says that age should stop immediately if there's a problem does it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=275.06s)]
*  It totally depends on the circumstances and situation does it depend on the country that's getting the aid it also depends on the country [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  Get receiving the aid. Yes, so what country does aid not stop immediately under Leahy? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=286.46s)]
*  I'd have to go back and look at through my notes. You you don't know what country that is. It's only one in the entire world [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  guess what [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  except [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=301.26s)]
*  for [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=303.26s)]
*  Israel [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=305.26s)]
*  Even now former senator pat way he was no longer in the Senate says Israel is getting a pass in violation of the spirit [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=307.26s)]
*  If not the letter of the law that he held passed beginning in the early 2000s [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=314.18s)]
*  I wrote to successive secretaries of state about the failure to apply the Leahy law to Israel [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=317.7s)]
*  The responses were either inconclusive or inaccurately claimed the law was being applied to Israel the same as to other countries which the State Department [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=322.78s)]
*  continues to insist today [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=329.42s)]
*  The State Department's dismissive response not only beggars credulity it also makes a mockery of the law [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=331.42s)]
*  This is pat Leahy liberal senator not a radical right not a fringe voice in American politics [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=337.14000000000004s)]
*  Someone who knows this issue who spent decades working on this issue and not just about Israel about all kinds of American allies [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=344.14000000000004s)]
*  And yet here we are [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=352.38s)]
*  President Biden is gonna hand a blank check for Israel [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  President Biden is gonna hand a blank check for Israel over to the incoming Trump administration [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=358.74s)]
*  I don't think it's coincidental that yesterday on Capitol Hill the house [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=364.06s)]
*  Overwhelmingly passed a bill to sanction officers of the International Criminal Court to punish them for moving to charge top Israeli leaders [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=367.9s)]
*  Including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with war crimes. Keep in mind the ICC also indicted leaders of Hamas for their war crimes [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  Appropriately and their holding of Israeli hostages which continues to this very day and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=384.24s)]
*  45 Democrats joined all Republicans to support this bill [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=391.08s)]
*  We know which vision of American global engagement the Trump administration will carry out [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=395.24s)]
*  But it isn't just Trump who this week is making an absolute mockery of every last lecture [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=401.24s)]
*  We deliver to the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else about respecting human rights in international law [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=406.18s)]
*  it is president Joe Biden to leaving a disgraceful legacy a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  Liberal president doing untold damage to the liberal international order [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=419.44s)]
*  You [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7lK1lyD20&t=442.24s)]
