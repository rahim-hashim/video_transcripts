# Alito didn’t recuse himself from case involving billionaire fishing friend: ProPublica
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We begin tonight with a photo. It is a photo of one of the most powerful men in the country and one of the richest. That is Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in the center with hedge fund billionaire and Republican mega donor Paul Singer to his right on an Alaskan fishing trip they took together in July of 2008. The two men are beaming as they proudly show off their freshly caught king salmon, the largest salmon I've ever seen someone catch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=0.0s)]
*  The photo is the attention grabbing centerpiece of a new pro public investigation into the previously undisclosed relationship between Justice Alito and Paul Singer, who later had business before the court cases from which Justice Alito did not recuse himself. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=29.0s)]
*  Pro publica of course also recently revealed the various financial entanglements and gifts bestowed upon Justice Clarence Thomas by another ideologically committed right wing billionaire Harlan Crowe. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=46.0s)]
*  And now we know that Thomas is not alone in accepting lavish gifts and not reporting them as is legally required. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=57.0s)]
*  The Alaskan trip was organized by another powerful member of the conservative lead that guy there in the center Leonard Leo, longtime head of the Federalist Society who's in the green jacket with his own freshly caught fish. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=64.0s)]
*  Pro publica reports that Leo invited Paul Singer to join the vacation and asked Singer if you know he and Alito could fly on the billionaire's jet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=76.0s)]
*  That flight, if chartered by the justice himself, would have cost an excess of $100,000 one way. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=84.0s)]
*  Leo, Singer and Alito stayed at a luxury fishing resort called the King Salmon Lodge that attracted celebrities and wealthy businessmen and charged over $1,000 a day. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=91.0s)]
*  The lodge had its own planes and pilots who flew the guests 70 miles west to a river known for having one of the best salmon runs in the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=101.0s)]
*  On another day, they flew to a waterfall in a national park where bears catch salmon from the water with their teeth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=109.0s)]
*  Most of us have to just watch that on the live stream sources told Pro Publica quote at night, the lodges chef served multi course meals of Alaskan king crab legs or Kobe filet. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=116.0s)]
*  On the last evening, a member of Alito's group bragged the wine they were drinking cost $1,000 a bottle. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=127.0s)]
*  Now, Justice Alito never disclosed any of it and never recused himself from any of Singer's subsequent cases before his court. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=132.0s)]
*  As one expert explained, quote, If you were good friends, what were you doing ruling on his case? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=139.0s)]
*  And if you weren't good friends, what were you doing accepting this? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=144.0s)]
*  Referring to the flight on the private jet. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=147.0s)]
*  Now, Samuel Alito desperately tried to get ahead of this very story last night before the actual Pro Publica article came out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=150.0s)]
*  Alito publishing an op ed in the Wall Street Journal alleging that quote Pro Publica misleads its readers, which is kind of funny because, well, no one had read the story yet. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=158.0s)]
*  No one even knew it was coming out except for the folks at Pro Publica and Justice Alito, who Pro Publica had asked for comment. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=168.0s)]
*  The document that he published is an extremely bitter defensive prebuttal, arguing that Paul Singer is somehow neither a friend nor someone giving him a gift. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=175.0s)]
*  Quote, My recollection is that I have spoken to Mr. Singer on no more than a handful of occasions, all of which, with the exception of small talk during a fishing trip 15 years ago, consisted of brief and casual comments at events attended by large groups. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=185.0s)]
*  Alito goes on to downplay the luxuriousness of the resort where they stayed, calling it, and I like this turn of phrase, a comfortable but rustic facility where the meals were homestyle fare. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=198.0s)]
*  He claims to be unable to recall whether the group of the lodge was served wine, but if there was wine, it was certainly not wine that cost $1,000. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=209.0s)]
*  Alito insists that there is no real way to quantify the value of the private jet flight on Paul Singer's private jet because, and I quote, Singer and others had already made arrangements to fly to Alaska when I was invited shortly before the event, and I was asked whether I would like to fly there in a seat that, as far as I am aware, would have otherwise been vacant. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=216.0s)]
*  Well, that makes sense, right? Of course, that's why airlines allow you to just hop on board for free if they happen to have any open seats that would otherwise be vacant, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=236.0s)]
*  Crucially, Justice Alito alleges there is no way he could have even known that Paul Singer was involved in the cases that came before the court. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=245.0s)]
*  Quote, Singer was not listed as a party in any of the cases listed by ProPublica. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=252.0s)]
*  Because his name did not appear in these filings, I was unaware of his connection with any of the listed entities, and I had no good reason to be aware of that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=256.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, you had Google. You had a bunch of really smart, high-performing law clerks who also could Google. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=264.0s)]
*  I mean, this really is a tough one to believe, particularly considering how much attention Singer's 2014 case against the nation of Argentina received. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=272.0s)]
*  It was enormous news. He was trying to basically recoup money, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=281.0s)]
*  As Reuters reporter Lawrence Hurley noted shortly after the story published, even his early reporting on the case before the court decided to hear it clearly named Singer and his company as key figures in the suit. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=286.0s)]
*  And Paul Singer is not some obscure character. He is one of the wealthiest people in this country and a prominent donor in conservative politics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=298.0s)]
*  He even got a shout out at Donald Trump's very first press conference as president. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=305.0s)]
*  Anti-Trump or as they say, never Trump. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=315.0s)]
*  And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=319.0s)]
*  So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=330.0s)]
*  Now this all comes in the wake of ProPublica's previous revelations about Clarence Thomas and billionaire Harlan Crowe. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=340.0s)]
*  And based on what we know so far, what's been reported, it seems that their justice billionaire relationship runs deeper than the ties between Sam Alito and Paul Singer. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=346.0s)]
*  I mean, Harlan Crowe, for example, took Clarence Thomas on several luxurious vacations over many years. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=356.0s)]
*  He purchased the justices mother's home where he's now her landlord as she lives rent free. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=361.0s)]
*  He even paid for Thomas's grandnephew's private school tuition. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=365.0s)]
*  But there's a commonality here. Both relationships do have the same contours. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=370.0s)]
*  Crucially, Leonard Leo, head of the Federalist Society. Oh, there he is again. He's a common thread. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=374.0s)]
*  He's pictured here. Remember this painting of Crowe and Thomas and the rest hanging out? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=379.0s)]
*  He's second from the left in this painting depicting one of Thomas's many visits to Crowe's Upstate New York Resort. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=384.0s)]
*  And both stories involve ritzy, glamorous gifts from right-wing billionaires with enormous obvious ideological and in some cases material interest before the court. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=389.0s)]
*  It is obvious, apparent to everyone that these relationships, trips such as these, are a form of soft lobbying, a form of influence peddling. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=400.0s)]
*  Anyone with any sense don't even have to be a lawyer. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=410.0s)]
*  But as Supreme Court justice should have, would understand that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=413.0s)]
*  Why are they taking me on this lavish trip to go fish for king salmon? Will me? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=417.0s)]
*  You would understand that and you either would not go along with it or at a minimum you would disclose it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=424.0s)]
*  Once again, we know that is not happening here because these justices view themselves, apparently at least, as existing above the law and certainly above the norms and rules that guide the other members of the federal judiciary. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=430.0s)]
*  That will likely remain the case. I mean, you know, what are we going to do? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=443.0s)]
*  Unless outside forces like Congress begin to impose real restrictions and they might be able to. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=449.0s)]
*  One of the most outspoken congressional critics of these ethical violations, Senator Dick Turbin of Illinois, chair of the Judiciary Committee, has largely deferred to the court of the police himself. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=454.0s)]
*  But after this article, he gave perhaps his strongest condemnation yet in response to the new report. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=463.0s)]
*  Let me state the obvious. There's something rotten going on in the Supreme Court of the United States of America. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=468.0s)]
*  The defense offered by Justice Alito is laughable, laughable. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=474.0s)]
*  I took that seat on the jet plane and didn't feel like I had to report it because it was going to be empty anyway. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=479.0s)]
*  Give me a break. There is no reason why the highest court in our land should have the lowest ethics in our government. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=486.0s)]
*  One of the few rules that justices do have to follow is the yearly publication of their financial disclosure forms. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=491.0s)]
*  Although, of course, as we've been learning, they often leave things out. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=497.0s)]
*  We're still waiting on those disclosures from both Justice Alito and Justice Thomas, who, interestingly enough, have received 90 day extensions. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=502.0s)]
*  . [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYqnPAmQ9Iw&t=521.0s)]
