# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 11
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, the moment we were all expecting has now arrived. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=0.0s)]
*  In a late night filing Monday, 30 minutes before the deadline, Donald Trump's attorneys formally asked for his trial in the classified documents case to be postponed indefinitely, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=6.0s)]
*  citing his 2024 presidential run and his inability to get a fair trial. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=17.0s)]
*  Trump's team asked Florida District Judge Aileen Cannon to reject the Justice Department's proposed trial start in December. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=22.0s)]
*  His lawyers argued that putting the ex-president on trial this year would be, and I quote, unreasonable, telling, and would result in a miscarriage of justice. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=30.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers cried political persecution in their reasoning before the court. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=40.0s)]
*  They also asked for the trial to be held after the election to ensure a fair jury and fair trial. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=52.0s)]
*  We are now expecting the Justice Department, Jack Smith's office, to respond to that indefinite delay request. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=61.0s)]
*  In fact, Trump's attorneys and federal prosecutors are actually going to meet face to face one week from today in the first pretrial meeting in the case to discuss the classified material. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=68.0s)]
*  The trial scheduling issue presumably will come up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=78.0s)]
*  But when the sweeping indictment was unsealed last month, remember, Special Counsel Jack Smith made extremely limited remarks, kind of got in, got out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=82.0s)]
*  It was the first and only remarks he has publicly made about the case, but he did make sure in that small amount of time to stress the fact that he would seek a speedy trial both to the public and the accused. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=89.0s)]
*  It's very important for me to note that the defendants in this case must be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=100.0s)]
*  To that end, my office will seek a speedy trial in this matter consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=112.0s)]
*  Now the accused, Donald Trump, is asking to delay that speedy trial, a right he is granted, just like any other criminal defendant in this country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=121.0s)]
*  He's not just asking to delay it. He's flat out asking to push it off until after the election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=128.0s)]
*  Now let's take a step back here. We knew this was coming, right? You knew it. I knew it. We all knew it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=133.0s)]
*  This was always the plan. It was telegraphed over the last few years by Donald Trump and Trump's associates, as we saw in lots of different reporting from different sources. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=138.0s)]
*  In fact, the New York Times reported last July, during the height of the January 6 hearings, that Trump had accelerated his planning for office as the pair of federal investigations had intensified. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=147.0s)]
*  And it was reported last summer that Trump had told associates that the legal protections of being president were front of mind for him in his decision to run for the office again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=158.0s)]
*  Donald Trump knew there was a good chance of being indicted in the multitude of investigations he faced, and he hoped that declaring his candidacy would be able to cloak him in a shield of invincibility of political interference and political persecution. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=169.0s)]
*  And so he did it. That's just what he did. He announced his 2024 run for office on November 15, 2022, an announcement coming nearly two years before the 2024 presidential election. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=183.0s)]
*  That's early. But the point was to get it in there. I'm now a candidate. You can't touch me. The game plan is clear. It always has been. Delay the trial, trials, who knows how many, win the election, dismiss the case, stay out of prison. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=197.0s)]
*  An indefinite delay causes harm. Now the reason I think he really wants to delay it past the 2024 election is this idea of no trial. What does that mean? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=212.0s)]
*  What does that mean? What it means is if Trump becomes president, he gets to appoint the new attorney general who could simply dismiss the case altogether. And I think that's the ultimate goal here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=221.0s)]
*  You can see that's exactly what's going on last night's filing. I mean, think of it this way. Donald Trump is literally running for his freedom. He is running to be president to stay out of prison. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=230.0s)]
*  Those are the stakes for Donald Trump, and he understands them as such. And the key to achieve that end is to delay as much as possible. In fact, his team has already tried that in fighting this investigation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=242.0s)]
*  Remember last summer after the FBI executed that search warrant on Trump's Florida Beach Club, one of the first things Trump's lawyers didn't respond was to sue to stop the Justice Department from reviewing the documents it had found, their own documents, government documents. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=254.0s)]
*  Trump argued the search was politically motivated and asked the judge to appoint a third party to review the seized materials. In other words, that was his effort to delay the investigation, keep the FBI from looking at the evidence in this cockamamie legal theory. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=269.0s)]
*  And guess what? It worked for a time. Trump's motion was granted by the same judge who is now overseeing his criminal trial, Judge Aileen Cannon, who herself was appointed by none other than Donald Trump, the defendant. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=284.0s)]
*  She was randomly assigned to the case last month, but back in August, she gave him this completely unprecedented break from normal criminal procedure. Shocking, really. And she agreed to appoint a special counsel or third party to comb through the trove of documents the FBI had discovered at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=298.0s)]
*  And it was consequentially delayed the Justice Department's access to some of that evidence for a few weeks until an appeals court overturned the decision of Cannon in a scathing, absolutely eviscerating ruling. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=315.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. In this case, especially every week matters. This guy, this twice indicted ex-president, he's got to get to the election. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=328.0s)]
*  It's like a chase movie where he's running from the law. Except what's at stake here is not just Donald Trump's prison time, but our own constitutional integrity. Can we actually hold this man, this powerful man accountable as if he were any other citizen? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=339.0s)]
*  And so here we are. We got 16 months on the clock. 16 months away from the 2024 election. Donald Trump has been indicted in this case on 37 felony counts. He lucked out and managed to get this same judge who gave him a break last year, acceded to his request for delay. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=354.0s)]
*  And she now has a monumental decision before her, Judge Aileen Cannon. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=371.0s)]
*  Last time she sided with Trump to the consternation and criticism of just about the entire legal community and the appellate court above her. The question now is, has she learned anything? Will she further collude with Donald Trump's scheme to stay out of prison? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=377.0s)]
*  He's very credible and the people on MSNBC who made fun of me when I said we had an informant that was missing, they should feel like fools right now. And this is their worst nightmare because, again, this is a credible witness that the FBI flew all the way to Brussels to interview and sent several agents to interview. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=393.0s)]
*  Recapping the news, James Comer's big witness is missing because he's running from the law. He is a literal fugitive from justice. Gal Luft, a dual US Israeli citizen, is also facing charges for arms trafficking, violating sanctions against Iran. He has been indicted for being an unregistered agent of the Chinese state. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=416.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. He was arrested in Cyprus back in February and then subsequently fled and remains a fugitive. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=437.0s)]
*  Okay, so what happens now to the Republicans to take down the Biden administration? Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland is the ranking member of the Oversight Committee that James Comer is currently the chair of and he joins me now. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=444.0s)]
*  It's good to have you Congressman Raskin. What do you make of all of this? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=456.0s)]
*  Well, this was going to be the big mystery whistleblower witness who was finally going to redeem the last six months of wasted effort and failures in Republican investigations on the Oversight Committee. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=463.0s)]
*  And suddenly the whole country knows now the reason he was missing is because he's a fugitive from the US government fleeing these charges of making false statements, being an arms trafficker, trying to set up this Chinese arms for Iranian oil deal, and then also failing to register as a foreign agent. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=478.0s)]
*  And you know, a series of multiple felonies. And it's extraordinary to me as I was leaving the Capitol this evening to learn that my colleagues, rather than simply going home and trying to ride out the Newsday, are doubling down now and saying that the Department of Justice is going after him because of the wealth of information that he presumably has to give them about, I don't know what, their previous failed efforts to get to the bottom of this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=505.0s)]
*  And then there's the reports that getting Joe Biden, the suspicious activities reports that went nowhere and revealed nothing on Biden or their form 1023, which also exploded their allegations of bribery about Biden because it turned out to be the same recycled Giuliani stuff that was rejected by Donald Trump's own US attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=535.0s)]
*  So none of it's leading anywhere. And yet they're continuing to dive back in like the cult members they've become. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=559.0s)]
*  Well, I just want to be clear on that. So my understanding is this indictment with the indictment happened last November. So it happened nine months ago, somewhere around there. Right. Eight or nine months ago, then he's apprehended in Cyprus in February. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=565.0s)]
*  And then he jumps bail. I mean, he escapes. Right. So now it's like a little bit of like the mini Trump thing where Trump's like, I declare for the presidency. And now if you indict me, I'm being persecuted. It seems like a little bit of like he puts out this video being like they're coming after me for my wealth of information. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=579.0s)]
*  Well, knowing that he's been indicted by the government for stuff he's done. Like it seems like maybe the Occam's razor here is he's trying to use this as a shield to protect himself from, you know, being brought to justice. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=595.0s)]
*  Well, you got it. I think Gal Luft wants to use the Republican Party exactly the same way that Donald Trump is using the Republican Party as a shield from criminal investigation and prosecution for accountability for his actions. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=608.0s)]
*  The same way that George Santos wants to use the Republican Party as an effort to essentially launder all of his crimes and all of his money. It's the exact same thing with this guy. But he's using the House Oversight Committee for those purposes. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=621.0s)]
*  Now, I want to talk about another allegation here, which I think is another thing that Comer's pursued, which to me as a higher degree of credibility because there's a named individual in it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=636.0s)]
*  There is an IRS whistleblower who we know actually worked the IRS, who has filed a whistleblower contained and he has alleged that there was political interference that happened from the Department of Justice, other U.S. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=646.0s)]
*  attorneys and maybe Merrick Garland as regards the Hunter Biden case and that David Weiss, the Trump appointed prosecutor who oversaw that case, was not allowed to pursue the case in the ways he wanted to. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=657.0s)]
*  That's the allegation. I think it's a more serious allegation because there's like a real actual person there who's actually gone. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=670.0s)]
*  So there's now a letter from Weiss basically knocking this down to Lindsey Graham and saying, no, this is all nonsense. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=678.0s)]
*  Where do you come down on it? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=686.0s)]
*  All right. And of course, Weiss is Donald Trump's U.S. attorney, but he's a United States attorney for the Department of Justice. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=689.0s)]
*  And, you know, those would be serious allegations. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=700.0s)]
*  But there's a process for going through determining whether or not they're true. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=703.0s)]
*  Weiss rejects them and denies them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=708.0s)]
*  But really what we see is a grasping at straws and attempt to find something, anything to get at Joe Biden. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=710.0s)]
*  And why? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=719.0s)]
*  Why? Because it's a massive distraction from the fact that Donald Trump had one overriding purpose in being in office and one overriding purpose and coming back into office. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=720.0s)]
*  He had a money making operation. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=731.0s)]
*  He converted the presidency into an instrument of profit maximization for himself and his family. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=733.0s)]
*  And he wants to keep this grift going. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=739.0s)]
*  So there's got to be an effort to bring down Joe Biden by putting him in the same category, which is ridiculous. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=742.0s)]
*  And it's not convincing to the American people. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=749.0s)]
*  Quickly and finally, Ben Cardin, who is the senator from your state, has announced he will not be seeking reelection. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=751.0s)]
*  There are folks looking to throw their hat in the ring. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=758.0s)]
*  You made the decision this week that you will not run for Senate. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=762.0s)]
*  Why did you make that decision? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=765.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm not throwing my bandana in the ring at this point because we're look, we're we're still in the thick of this fight to defend American democracy and democratic institutions against the autocrats and the theocrats and the kleptocrats like Donald Trump. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=767.0s)]
*  And I'm exactly where I need to be as the ranking Democrat at the Oversight Committee. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=786.0s)]
*  And when we win the House back in 2024 and we will, I will be the chair of the Oversight Committee. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=792.0s)]
*  And I want to see this through. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=798.0s)]
*  And I want to make sure that we're going to win the House back. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=801.0s)]
*  I'm going to be going all across the country to campaign for fellow Democrats. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=804.0s)]
*  And I'd rather be campaigning for Democrats across America than against fellow Democrats in Maryland. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=808.0s)]
*  And so, you know, that's the judgment that I've made at this point. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=814.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2L27C6MlqI&t=822.0s)]
