Video Description: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is promoting a bizarre conspiracy theory about how "they" are controlling hurricanes—and aiming them at Trump counties. “Conservatives remain so deep in their denial, they’re flailing around for anyone or anything else to blame,” says Chris Hayes on the Republican climate denialism.

# Marjorie Taylor Greene believes 'bizarre' hurricane conspiracy over climate change
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall in Florida early Thursday morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  At this hour, the storm is back to category five strength. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=7.0s)]
*  As the National Hurricane Center advises, quote, Florida residents should get their families and homes ready and evacuate if told to do so. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=11.0s)]
*  Milton is currently reaching maximum sustained winds of 165 miles per hour. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=19.0s)]
*  The storm is expected to pick up forward speed tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=25.0s)]
*  The storm will continue to move across that arc you see there across the Gulf of Mexico until it makes landfall. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=28.0s)]
*  Now, the latest data predicts a storm surge of up to 10 to 15 feet south of Sarasota. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=34.0s)]
*  Localized areas in central and north Florida could also see up to 18 inches of rain, threatening catastrophic flooding. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=42.0s)]
*  Hurricane specialist John Morales, he's the longest tenured TV meteorologist in south Florida, got choked up as he delivered the devastating report last night. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=50.0s)]
*  It's just an incredible, incredible, incredible hurricane. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=59.0s)]
*  It has dropped. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=64.0s)]
*  It has dropped 50 millibars. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=70.0s)]
*  In 10 hours. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=73.0s)]
*  I apologize. This is just horrific. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=77.0s)]
*  When the maximum sustained winds are 160 miles per hour and it it is just gaining strength in the Gulf of Mexico where you can imagine the winds. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=82.0s)]
*  I mean, the seas are just so incredibly, incredibly hot, record hot, as you might imagine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=95.0s)]
*  You know what's driving that. I don't need to tell you global warming, climate change leading to this and becoming an increasing threat. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=102.0s)]
*  As John Morales says, we do know why this is happening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=110.0s)]
*  Climate change is making our earth and especially our oceans hotter. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=113.0s)]
*  The Gulf of Mexico has seen record warm water this year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=118.0s)]
*  We covered it actually in the summer warning that this was going to happen. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=122.0s)]
*  Those higher temperatures fuel stronger storms with higher winds, more rain and worse flooding. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=125.0s)]
*  I mean, all this stuff is complex. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=131.0s)]
*  Storms are complex, but this part is simple. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=134.0s)]
*  The storm essentially sucks up the heat and uses it as energy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=136.0s)]
*  It is like packing more dynamite into a bomb. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=139.0s)]
*  The warmer the water, the more energy there is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=142.0s)]
*  Now, Hurricane Helene just showed us how this phenomenon is wreaking havoc, even in areas previously thought to be safe from these kinds of storms. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=144.0s)]
*  Tucked away deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Asheville, North Carolina was considered a little slice of paradise. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=154.0s)]
*  Some called it a climate haven, suggesting it was immune to extreme weather. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=161.0s)]
*  But last week, that paradise turned out to be an illusion. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=167.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=171.0s)]
*  Pulling battering the area for days, ripping apart homes, washing out roads, toppling trees and cutting off entire towns. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=172.0s)]
*  New research out this week says there is strong evidence human-driven climate change strengthened Helene's destructive power. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=180.0s)]
*  One study saying it made the storm's rainfall up to 20 percent heavier and its winds 7 percent stronger. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=187.0s)]
*  We're seeing these events that are boosted by climate change. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=194.0s)]
*  Stronger, wetter, lasting longer. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=198.0s)]
*  Another report found that a warmer climate led to 50 percent more rain over parts of the Carolinas and Georgia than would have been expected. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=202.0s)]
*  Storms like Helene and what we expect to come from Milton are exactly, precisely what experts have been screaming about for decades now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=210.0s)]
*  As John Morales told Nicole Wallace, it is why he got so emotional over last night's forecast. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=218.0s)]
*  When I saw 50 millibars in 10 hours, I just broke down with a mixture of empathy, angst over these increasing extreme weather events and also frustration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=225.0s)]
*  Because for over 20 years, I've been trying to communicate on on what would be coming if we did not check the injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=236.0s)]
*  And well, here we are. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=248.0s)]
*  And it's not going to get any better. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=250.0s)]
*  So we are now preparing for the second major climate change fueled hurricane in two weeks, which could put a dangerous strain on federal resources. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=252.0s)]
*  New York Times reports the Federal Emergency Management Agency is running out of staff to deal with the potential devastation of Hurricane Milton. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=260.0s)]
*  As of Monday morning, just nine percent of FEMA's personnel were available to respond to the hurricane or other disasters. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=267.0s)]
*  Now, while FEMA says it is well equipped to handle the strains, it is a reminder the challenge of more frequent natural disasters. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=273.0s)]
*  The Times noting that FEMA is also responding to flooding and landslides in Vermont, tornadoes in Kansas, the aftermath of Tropical Storm Debbie in New York and Georgia and the watch fire in Arizona. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=280.0s)]
*  And those are just disasters that were declared in the past two weeks. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=290.0s)]
*  Remember what I'm telling you right now, what we're looking at right now in the last week, what we're preparing for with Milton. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=293.0s)]
*  This is what we are now facing with global average temperatures a little over one degree Celsius higher than the pre-industrial average. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=299.0s)]
*  One. Imagine what it will look like when we reach two degrees, twice as bad, or three or four. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=307.0s)]
*  That is the world Donald Trump would push us towards faster if he returns to the White House. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=316.0s)]
*  Not that he cares, he thinks it would be good for real estate values. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=322.0s)]
*  When I hear these people talking about global warming, that's the global warming you have to worry about. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=326.0s)]
*  Not that the ocean is going to rise in 400 years, an eighth of an inch, and you'll have more seafront property, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=332.0s)]
*  If that happens, I said, is that good or bad? I said, isn't that a good thing? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=338.0s)]
*  If I have a little property on the ocean, I have a little bit more property. I have a little bit more ocean. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=343.0s)]
*  OK, every time I play this clip, we just got to stop for one second. Think about that for give it 10 seconds of your brain power. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=347.0s)]
*  If the oceans rise, do you have more beachfront property? Does that make sense? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=354.0s)]
*  If the oceans rise, you have more beachfront or you have less, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=360.0s)]
*  Now, we've known for decades our planet is warming, that we would start seeing the brutal effects. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=364.0s)]
*  But conservatives remain so deep in their denial, they're flailing around for anyone or anything else to blame. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=368.0s)]
*  Republican Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is now like a big mover and shaker in the Republican Party, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=374.0s)]
*  is promoting a bizarre conspiracy theory about a mysterious they, you can imagine who that is, controlling the weather, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=379.0s)]
*  suggesting that they are sending hurricanes to Republican areas to impact the election. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=387.0s)]
*  Like someone is sitting at some computer somewhere pressing hurricane. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=392.0s)]
*  And it's not just her. She's now being amplified by right-wing media and the Republican nominee himself. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=396.0s)]
*  Has the government figured out how to build a storm into a super storm that will destroy everything in its path and then how to aim it right for where they want to aim it? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=403.0s)]
*  It just happens to miss South Florida, where all the Democrats live. Something strange is going on. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=412.0s)]
*  These are Trump counties. And don't tell me for a second, don't tell me for a second that what we're not seeing is a massive government-pushed voter suppression operation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=419.0s)]
*  You know, it's largely a Republican area. So some people say they did it for that reason. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=430.0s)]
*  I don't even think they're that bad, but they probably maybe they are. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=435.0s)]
*  They, they, they're sending the storms. They are sending the storms. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=438.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's running, they, Jeannie Vance, found a way to get in on it too. Blame it on immigrants. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=443.0s)]
*  You have FEMA, which is there for disaster relief for American citizens after a terrible storm, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=448.0s)]
*  being deployed repeatedly to deal with Kamala Harris's wide open border and the migrant invasion that it's caused, that lack of focus on their core mission, that distraction and focusing instead on illegal immigrants. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=454.0s)]
*  I guarantee that it has made the disaster response worse. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=466.0s)]
*  OK, that's false. Both FEMA and the White House dispute those claims, saying the disaster relief fund is completely separate from other programs. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=469.0s)]
*  But again, it's not really surprising. This is the way the right wing and Republicans, even high ranking ones are reacting. The guy at the top of the ticket, right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=475.0s)]
*  It was never going to be the case they would see the real impacts of climate change, the carbon we put in the atmosphere, the heat that it's trapped that ends up in the ocean, that fuels our storms to see all that, which is again not hard to understand at all. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=483.0s)]
*  After decades of denial and be like, you know what? My bad. That's on us. We were wrong. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=494.0s)]
*  But their behavior in the face of this dire consequence of this impending one to punch from the southeast should serve as a wake up call to everyone stuck here in reality about the very real stakes of this. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=499.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wexbl4Beb6Y&t=513.0s)]
