# Harris reacts to Trump NABJ meltdown ‘The American people deserve better’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk)
*  That was Vice President Kamala Harris addressing the convention of Sigma Gamma [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=0.0s)]
*  Rho Society Incorporated in Houston, Texas. Still with me, Stuart Stevens, senior [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=7.76s)]
*  advisor for the Lincoln Project, the Lindsay Johnson Democratic Strategist, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=12.86s)]
*  and Kadia Goba, reporter for Semaphore who interviewed Donald Trump today at [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=16.56s)]
*  the NABJ conference. So that, you know, to be honest, I thought I thought she'd [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=21.36s)]
*  have a little bit more fun and lean into that conversation that you had today, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=29.22s)]
*  Kadia, with with Donald Trump. But I think I think what we saw was her sort of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=35.5s)]
*  making a note of it and not having that frame how she wants to run this campaign [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=41.46s)]
*  and how she wants to be as president. How did you read what she said there just [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=49.18s)]
*  overall and how she's framing herself as you have others out there, particularly, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  you know, at other media outlets trying to define her a certain way, DEI, you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=62.81999999999999s)]
*  know, candidate, for example. Yeah, I know you raised a good point. I think she was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=70.34s)]
*  very careful about how she characterized that the incident or the interview early [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=76.06s)]
*  today. But she brought it up. Yeah, I mean, she I feel like Donald Trump just gave [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=82.48s)]
*  her, you know, a whole new ad campaign that she could possibly run on in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=93.04s)]
*  future. But she was, you know, respectful about it. I didn't dig too hard. But she [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  said, you know, her framing was this is what you can expect, right? He hasn't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=103.68s)]
*  changed. And like I said, he just kind of gave her that one of the first things I [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=108.16s)]
*  was thinking about when this was happening, I was like, Oh, well, you know, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=114.52s)]
*  this is a great opportunity for his opponent to really highlight that. But [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=117.92s)]
*  also she talked on all the other talk, hit on all the other points. I was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  surprised she didn't bring up didn't do the offense on like, immigration, but she [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=127.36s)]
*  brought up abortion, reminding people like this guy said that he would, you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=132.96s)]
*  know, promise to put judges in and this is what he did. And then pivoted onto [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=137.12s)]
*  like what we now see as the rollback of Roe versus Wade. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=141.68s)]
*  Alencia, for Democrats, this is this is 180 degrees from where you were four [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=147.44s)]
*  weeks ago. There's no doubt about that. The energy is different. The mood of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=152.8s)]
*  country about the presidential campaign has changed. What have you seen that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=158.16s)]
*  translates for you into the possibilities this fall for winning this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=166.28s)]
*  election, holding the house, maybe gaining additional seats there, and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=172.4s)]
*  maybe even keeping the Senate in in viable play, given the way the Harris [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  campaign has really come out of the blocks, and has taken moments like this, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=183.68s)]
*  galvanized, you know, not just those those interests within the Democratic [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=189.72s)]
*  Party, those who are already Democrats support the party, etc. But a lot of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=195.96s)]
*  folks that Stuart and I know, center right, independent voters, center right [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=200.0s)]
*  Republicans who are looking now and taking another look. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=205.88s)]
*  Listen, I think since Vice President Harris has become the presumptive [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=210.96s)]
*  nominee, we still have to go through convention and her accept the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=215.04s)]
*  nomination. The path to our victory has opened up quite a bit more. Right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=217.84s)]
*  I think the reality is in this race, we already knew what we were voting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=222.92s)]
*  against. Right. The past the I would say the seventeen hundredth form of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=226.8s)]
*  ideology that the Republican Party is running on. We knew what we were voting [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=232.4s)]
*  against. We knew that they overturn these rights for women, for black people, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=236.72s)]
*  for anybody who was not white male benefiting from nepotism. But she is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=239.68s)]
*  symbolizing now the hope for the future. We can see hope for the future. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=244.44s)]
*  I want to be very clear that this engagement at Sigma Gamma Rose, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  who already incorporated their conference, I am a member of the Divine [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=252.48s)]
*  Nine. I'm a Delta member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated. This was [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=255.92s)]
*  actually already planned. She was actually going to speak to the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=259.56s)]
*  sororities in the Divine Nine this summer because as many people know, and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=262.8s)]
*  maybe some viewers don't understand, these organizations are anchors in black [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=267.84s)]
*  communities and there are hundreds of thousands of members were already [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=272.4s)]
*  actually excited about her. Now there's even more energy now that she's the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  presumptive nominee and they are even more galvanized to go out and make sure [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=281.2s)]
*  they expand the electorate. Since her since she was announced as her [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  candidacy was announced last week, we see more young people who are engaged. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  The numbers are moving in our favor. We you all have reported extensively on [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  the different coalitions that have organically come up across Zoom from [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=299.16s)]
*  black women and women with black women all the way to white dudes for Kamala [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=304.68s)]
*  Harris this week that raised four million dollars and that coalition is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=308.44s)]
*  going to continue to expand and it's going to include a lot of factions of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=312.68s)]
*  the party from the moderates, the never Trumpers to also the progressives and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=316.56s)]
*  young people and everyone in between. Stewart, our friend Tim Miller put out a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=321.76s)]
*  tweet while watching what was happening on the stage there at the NABJ interview [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=327.56s)]
*  and he said, this interview was an example of why the people who demand [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=336.36s)]
*  that we deplatform Trump are wrong. People should see this. A grumpy, cruel, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=340.36s)]
*  hard of hearing, race-baiting a-hole having to actually answer for his track [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=345.88s)]
*  record in an environment outside of his comfort zone. I happen to agree a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=351.56s)]
*  thousand percent with that view. I know if I recall I think you do too the more [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  the public sees and hears Donald Trump in many cases he makes the case against [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  himself. Yeah, I think what's different about this than flashing back to 2016 [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=371.16s)]
*  where you're just throwing up Trump rallies. This is different. He's on stage [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  with three journalists who are challenging him, who are asking him tough [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=384.68s)]
*  questions. Trump, he doesn't like women. He is terrified of black women. He sees [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  much of what has happened to him as a result of black women and he refuses to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=394.96s)]
*  take responsibility for anything. If you were working for the Donald Trump [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=400.84s)]
*  campaign, when you were watching this, it was like watching a baby call across to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=406.76s)]
*  the interstate at night. You just couldn't look and they couldn't get him off [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=410.4s)]
*  that stage fast enough. This is a long campaign. You can't hide Donald Trump. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  I've seen this before in campaigns. When a candidate thinks they're going to win [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=424.08s)]
*  and then that gets pulled back from them, that can be a devastating moment for him. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=428.32s)]
*  Very few candidates have the emotional maturity to deal with that well. They have [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  to adjust and they have to come back. I don't think Donald Trump has the ability [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=437.24s)]
*  to adjust here. I think this is a Donald Trump, the angry Donald Trump, embittered, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=440.6s)]
*  you owe me, why are you stopping me from what is my rightful? I already am [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  president of the United States. People just don't realize it. And I think it's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  extraordinarily unattractive to most Americans. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6rTNHawTk&t=453.6s)]
