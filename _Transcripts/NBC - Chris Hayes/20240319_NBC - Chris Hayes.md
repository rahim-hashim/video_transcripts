# 'Drowning' New details on Trump's ‘absolutely desperate' finances
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg)
*  Donald Trump cannot pay his bills. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=0.0s)]
*  He is currently drowning in debt, including half a billion dollars in legal judgments [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=2.84s)]
*  against him. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=7.2s)]
*  And while the ex-president owns assets, lots of them, real property that he could sell [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=8.2s)]
*  in a rushed forced liquidation, he doesn't have the actual cash that he needs on hand. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=11.96s)]
*  Just yesterday, we learned that Trump was unable to secure a bond for the $454 million [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  penalty he owes from his New York civil fraud case. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=24.96s)]
*  That is after, quote, approaching about 30 companies that provide appeal bonds. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=29.22s)]
*  In the last year alone, Trump spent more than $55 million in donor money on legal fees. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=33.94s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump's personal finances have always been shaky. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=39.86s)]
*  He received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father's real estate empire, but [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=43.9s)]
*  his businesses managed to lose over a billion dollars in one decade. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=47.34s)]
*  His one real actual business success was playing a successful business person on The Apprentice, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  which actually did earn him over $400 million, including licensing and endorsement deals. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=57.5s)]
*  When Donald Trump came down that golden escalator Trump Tower, he began the other most successful [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=62.94s)]
*  money-making enterprise of his life, which was raking in donations from small-dollar [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=68.74s)]
*  donors. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  And now, just like his personal finances, that part is breaking down. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=74.78s)]
*  CNBC reports that Trump's reelection campaign has begun to see warning signs that the small-dollar [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=80.34s)]
*  donors who fueled his last run from the White House have slowed their support. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=86.18s)]
*  Back in the 2020 cycle, the $378 million he raised from small-dollar contributions represented [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=90.5s)]
*  almost half of the total cash that Trump's campaign pulled in. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  In 2023, Trump's reelection campaign raised 62.5 percent less money from small-dollar [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=100.22s)]
*  donors than it did in 2019 in the run-up to that election. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=106.9s)]
*  In January, the campaign reported raising around $3 million from small-dollar donors. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=111.64s)]
*  $3 million. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=117.04s)]
*  Now compare that to President Biden's campaign raising nearly $2 million in just one day. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=118.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has been hitting up the same group of people for money over and over and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=124.4s)]
*  over and over again, a lot of it to pay his legal bills, like the $55 million he spent [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=127.56s)]
*  last year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=131.32s)]
*  And what's happening is they're kind of running out of cash. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=132.32s)]
*  There's only so much that you can hammer a fundraising list until it stops giving you [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=136.48s)]
*  back the money. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=141.48s)]
*  This is a big deal because Trump's appeal with small-dollar donors has been crucial [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  to his political success. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=147.2s)]
*  It provided him with a direct line to what seemed like endless money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  It insulated him from other parts of the Republican Party infrastructure, which couldn't hurt [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=152.48s)]
*  him by withholding big donors or fundraisers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=156.76s)]
*  It served as a source of power that he wielded over others who were desperate to get their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=159.92s)]
*  hands on that Trump donor list so they could pump those same people for money as well. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=164.12s)]
*  It was even part of his appeal, especially back in 2016, when he claimed to be self-funding [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=169.2s)]
*  his campaign. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=173.28s)]
*  Of course, that wasn't true. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=174.28s)]
*  And the small-dollar donations that sustained him dry up, Trump and his allies are making [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=176.6s)]
*  increasingly desperate appeals. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=181.32s)]
*  If you could chip in, if you've done well, if you remember those great four years that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=184.48s)]
*  we had where you made a lot, we need your help. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=191.44s)]
*  You need to help this man, Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=195.28s)]
*  They're trying to drain him dry. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=198.52s)]
*  He spent more money on lawyers than most people spend on campaigns. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=200.24s)]
*  Give the president some money to fight this bullsh**. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=204.04s)]
*  This is going to destroy America. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=207.44s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm so upset, but please help President Trump. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=209.36s)]
*  If you could afford five or ten bucks. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=213.06s)]
*  I am very humbly asking if you could chip in five, ten, or even $25. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=215.24s)]
*  If you've ever voted for my father, I'm asking you to chip in five, ten, or even $25 to his [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=221.08s)]
*  campaign today. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=225.96s)]
*  Crooked Joe Biden has an army of liberal billionaires bankrolling his campaign. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=227.4s)]
*  But if everyone watching this video chips into my dad's campaign, he'll be able to drown [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  them out once and for all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=236.12s)]
*  With your donation today, we will win back the White House. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=237.56s)]
*  We will make America great again, greater than ever before, I promise you that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so that's just a little sample. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  We could have done that for hours, okay? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=249.24s)]
*  And that's the videos. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=251.56s)]
*  Then there are all the texts and emails. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=253.4s)]
*  You would not believe the sheer volume. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  The Trump campaign sends an average of ten fundraising emails per day, and they're even [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=257.6s)]
*  more dramatic than anything on camera. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=263.32s)]
*  This one sent today includes a quote, solid promise that Trump quote, will never surrender [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  in his quest for presidential immunity. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=269.82s)]
*  Ask his followers to make the same song pledge to me and the rest of the country so we can [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=272.0s)]
*  save America together. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=275.64s)]
*  Of course, with a link to donating. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=277.68s)]
*  Yesterday, this message from Donald Trump claimed that his enemies are lying about his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=279.52s)]
*  comments about a bloodbath and he loses the election. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Quote, before the day is over, I'm asking every single one of my supporters to chip [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=285.8s)]
*  in and say, I stand with President Trump. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=289.74s)]
*  There is even a special Valentine's Day fundraising appeal written as a love letter to Trump's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  wife Melania that included a link to send your love and some cash for the campaign. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  And again, you are probably familiar with the genre. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=303.2s)]
*  It crosses party lines, it crosses ideologies like smaller dollar fundraising like this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=306.08s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  But the problem they have is that they've been doing this so hard, so aggressively for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  so long, like they're just, it's the wells run dry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=316.2s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=320.08s)]
*  That's what they're beginning to realize. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=321.26s)]
*  And clearly we have a presumptive nominee for president who is desperate, I mean absolutely [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=323.41999999999996s)]
*  desperate for immediate cash infusions for two purposes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  Both his personal finances and his political finances. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=333.36s)]
*  And he's in the market, man. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, he's got his hand out, okay? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=341.48s)]
*  He could take that money from just about anyone and promise them just about anything if he [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=344.2s)]
*  gets back in the White House. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  Earlier this month, Trump met with the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, who certainly [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  has policy preferences he would like to see from the U.S. government. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=355.2s)]
*  Musk claimed after the meeting he's not donating to either candidate for president, although [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=358.56s)]
*  Elon Musk says lots of things that turn out not to be true. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=362.46s)]
*  Trump also met with conservative hedge fund manager Jeff Yass, who has a $33 billion stake [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=365.94s)]
*  in TikTok and has reportedly threatened to cut off funding to Republicans who support [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=371.18s)]
*  the TikTok divestment bill. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=375.02s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=376.9s)]
*  Days later, Trump came out and flipped his position on banning the social media platform. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=377.9s)]
*  Of course, there are also many foreign entities who would love to have power and influence [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=383.74s)]
*  over the man who may be the next president of the United States. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=387.41999999999996s)]
*  And Trump may make that even easier for them by bringing in his 2016 campaign manager Paul [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=391.18s)]
*  Manafort, remember him? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=396.14s)]
*  Back into the fold. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=397.88s)]
*  This is a guy who was convicted of tax and bank fraud in relation to his lobbying for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=399.62s)]
*  pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=404.7s)]
*  Prosecutors alleged Manafort shared polling data with, quote, a Russian who the U.S. government [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=408.1s)]
*  said had ties to Russian intelligence. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=411.9s)]
*  Without his small dollar donors, Donald Trump is financially desperate. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  It brings danger in every direction. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=420.06s)]
*  This guy just needing money, cash infusions from wherever he can get it for whatever they [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=422.1s)]
*  need. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=427.98s)]
*  It's danger that's political and legal, national security danger. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=428.98s)]
*  The last thing you want is a president who's an owned man his first day in office. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqwU_OF7rg&t=434.38s)]
