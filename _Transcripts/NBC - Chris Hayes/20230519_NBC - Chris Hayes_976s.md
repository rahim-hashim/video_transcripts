# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 18
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, it is official Florida [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis is running for the Republican nomination for president. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=3.92s)]
*  NBC News confirms he will file the paperwork and make a formal announcement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  next week. And of course, this is not a surprise. It has been widely [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=12.32s)]
*  anticipated because for months DeSantis has been hitting the donor circuit and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=15.72s)]
*  the early campaign trail, making appearances in Iowa, New Hampshire. And [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=20.12s)]
*  in fact, he has turned his entire governing agenda in Florida into a kind [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=24.16s)]
*  of set piece for his presidential campaign. He has been waging a culture [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=29.04s)]
*  war on his own constituents for the purpose of elevating himself. It's a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=34.12s)]
*  very clear and coherent strategy. While Ron DeSantis tours around the country [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  promoting himself and his new memoir titled The Courage to Be Free, at [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=44.44s)]
*  home he runs a government based on the opposite of freedom. His agenda is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  about state authority and its punitive use and decrees from on high. In [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=54.4s)]
*  Florida, he is running a kind of little MAGA kingdom in which Ron DeSantis and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=59.64s)]
*  the Republican Party in the state legislature with their big majorities [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=64.52s)]
*  tell you how to live your life and you don't get to choose. Now we're hearing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=67.64s)]
*  the word authoritarian a lot more these days. In the wake of the first ever [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=73.08s)]
*  attempt to overturn American democracy, particularly, we use it on the show, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump encouraged those authoritarian impulses and Ron DeSantis [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=79.92s)]
*  has stoked them. He's put them into practice. But I think the discussion [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=84.48s)]
*  about the threat of authoritarianism can sometimes feel almost a little [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=89.16s)]
*  remote or academic. That word has a certain kind of historical timbre to it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=92.56s)]
*  We associate the term with like stern historical figures like Stalin or [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Mussolini and that can make it hard to look at Mr. Pudding fingers yucking it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=101.0s)]
*  up on the campaign trail in Iowa and see an authoritarian. But Ron DeSantis [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=105.68s)]
*  really is running on an authoritarian agenda. The policies he has enacted in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=111.6s)]
*  Florida are the opposite of freedom. To me, the opposite of core American values [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=117.12s)]
*  because in Ron DeSantis's Florida, the state will decide what books your child [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=122.12s)]
*  can or cannot read in their school library by threatening teachers and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  librarians with time in prison if they do not comply with vague laws about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=131.0s)]
*  instruction on race, gender and sexuality. The state will decide what [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=135.44s)]
*  women can do with their own bodies by banning abortion at six weeks. Of course, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=140.24s)]
*  that is for all intents and purposes, a complete abortion ban, which means that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=144.84s)]
*  Ron DeSantis and the Republican Party of Florida control the bodies of every [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=149.0s)]
*  Floridian who can get pregnant. It's their body, not yours. The state will [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=153.4s)]
*  also decide how you can dress in public, which costumes you can wear by enacting [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=158.24s)]
*  what is essentially a full ban on drag performances that will also likely [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=163.38s)]
*  restrict pride events. The state will decide what kind of speech corporations [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=167.18s)]
*  can engage in, including which criticism they can make of the government by [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=171.98s)]
*  going after Disney punitively for speaking out against anti LGBTQ laws. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=176.5s)]
*  That fight has become quite notorious, blew up to the point that Disney [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=182.7s)]
*  announced today it's abandoning a $1 billion planned development in Florida. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=186.46s)]
*  We'll see what sort of reprisals the state wages against that company. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=192.26000000000002s)]
*  But Ron DeSantis' dystopian authoritarian vision is most apparent in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=198.58s)]
*  legislation he just signed yesterday. It bans all gender affirming care for all [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=203.18s)]
*  minors in Florida, everyone 18 and younger. That law also empowers state [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  courts to change custody agreements if a child is receiving or is at risk of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=212.62s)]
*  receiving gender affirming care, meaning taking a kid away from a parent. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=217.98s)]
*  Telling parents how they can or cannot raise their own children is among the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=224.7s)]
*  most authoritarian things the government can do. And now that is exactly what [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  Ron DeSantis and the Republican Party in Florida and generally the conservative [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=233.34s)]
*  movement that endorses this are doing purely for ideological and punitive [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=236.9s)]
*  purposes. Now the sick irony here, the one that I just can't get over and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=241.74s)]
*  really kind of sticks with me, is that the right wing movement that gave us [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=246.58s)]
*  this new law signed yesterday is the very same group of people that screamed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  about parental rights for years amidst the pandemic. I get to say whether my [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=256.82s)]
*  kid wears a mask, I get to say whether my kid gets vaccinated, I get to say [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  whether my kid goes to school. And Ron DeSantis was the public face of that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=266.62s)]
*  movement. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  He wants to have the government force kindergartners to wear masks in school. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=273.14s)]
*  He doesn't believe the parents should have a say in that. He thinks that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=279.58s)]
*  should be a decision for the government. Well, I can tell you in Florida, the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=283.14s)]
*  parents are going to be the ones in charge of that decision. Joe Biden [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=286.9s)]
*  suggests that if you don't do lockdown policies, then you should quote get out [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=290.26s)]
*  of the way. But let me tell you this, if you're coming after the rights of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=295.86s)]
*  parents in Florida, I'm standing in your way. I'm not going to let you get away [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=299.86s)]
*  with it. What a tough guy. You see all that swagger. He's going to stand in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=303.54s)]
*  your way. If you're coming after parental rights, if you try to tell a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=308.46s)]
*  parent what they can do with their kids, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=311.5s)]
*  that very same wing of the Republican Party, embodied by Ron DeSantis and the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=314.42s)]
*  government of the state of Florida, has now demanded and produced a situation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=318.34s)]
*  in which the government, that guy you saw there with the tough guy swagger [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=322.46s)]
*  about freedom, is going to decide if your child who lives in your home that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=325.86s)]
*  you gave birth to or raised that you love your kid, what kind of care they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=332.38s)]
*  can get. He decides. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=337.78s)]
*  Care that, to be clear, the American Academy of Pediatrics supports and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  recommends. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=346.46s)]
*  Think about what this means. Right now, as I'm speaking to you, their parents [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=349.42s)]
*  and families in Florida, who have decided as a family, as parents, along [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=352.66s)]
*  with their doctors, that this health care, gender affirming care, is the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=358.06s)]
*  best care for their kids. You may not like it, but you know what? It's none [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=362.18s)]
*  of your, excuse me, goddamn business. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=367.22s)]
*  To me, that is what the courage to be free means. Freedom means that in my [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=372.1s)]
*  household, our family decides what kind of health care our child does or does [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=379.22s)]
*  not get. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  Not Ron DeSantis, not the Republican Party. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=388.5s)]
*  But that is no longer the case in Florida. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  I think this is something that we just made the decision as a state and me as [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=396.38000000000005s)]
*  governor to just say, you know, we're protecting kids and we're going to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=401.86s)]
*  protect kids when it's popular. We'll protect kids even when you take some [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=405.78s)]
*  incoming as a result of maybe offending some ideologies or some agendas out [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=411.05999999999995s)]
*  there, but that's fine. We're happy to do that because this is important. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=415.78s)]
*  They're happy to tell you whether you can get an abortion, whether you can [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=420.73999999999995s)]
*  give birth or not. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=424.73999999999995s)]
*  Government of Florida, Vyra and DeSantis, they made that decision for you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=426.29999999999995s)]
*  They made the decision about your child's health care. They decided the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=428.9s)]
*  kind of care your child can receive. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=432.53999999999996s)]
*  Ron DeSantis probably knows pretty well, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=434.58s)]
*  What's best for your 13 year old, the one that lives in your house? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=437.02s)]
*  Their courts could decide to take that child away from you if you violate their [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=442.46s)]
*  rules, their ideology. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=447.66s)]
*  As a parent, I cannot think of anything more horrifying or un-American than [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=451.1s)]
*  that. And yet it is going to be the centerpiece of Ron DeSantis's presidential [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=456.1s)]
*  campaign. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=461.46000000000004s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=464.98s)]
*  Where are the migrant children? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=466.02s)]
*  You guys, we lost them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=467.7s)]
*  We're accepting them. We love them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=469.18s)]
*  Now that you've lost them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=469.90000000000003s)]
*  We love the migrant children. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  This is the family. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=471.94s)]
*  We lost them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=472.26s)]
*  You can't find them. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=473.46s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=474.5s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=476.02s)]
*  Migrant children missing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=477.38s)]
*  No, no, we don't know anything. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=478.66s)]
*  I don't know. That's Fox News. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=480.18s)]
*  Hey, let me tell you something. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  I need you to save the party. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=483.38s)]
*  Yelling, shouting, raising his voice. He has aggressive, his physical mannerisms [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=486.66s)]
*  are aggressive and I am concerned about it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=492.18s)]
*  I feel threatened by him. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=494.1s)]
*  Jevon Bowman is here with me now to respond to those accusations from Congressman Marjorie [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=497.06s)]
*  Taylor Greene. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=501.54s)]
*  He has been menacing me during the entire commercial break. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=502.02s)]
*  I should note that my full disclosure, my pretty work for you, he no longer does. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=505.38s)]
*  But I, I, I, well, what do you want to say to that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=510.1s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=512.74s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's so nonsensical that it's comical. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=514.02s)]
*  You can see clearly in the video that we were like playfully jousting with each other. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=518.42s)]
*  She was laughing. I was laughing. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=523.78s)]
*  We were talking about each other's party and certain issues. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=525.78s)]
*  So the demeanor and the disposition, you know, on the steps, it was, it was, it was playful. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=529.62s)]
*  We were, we were going after each other. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=534.02s)]
*  So for her the next morning to say what she said, I mean, it's a complete 180 number one. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=536.02s)]
*  It's no longer comical now because now you are using historical racist tropes toward black men [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=541.94s)]
*  menacing his mannerisms. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=550.34s)]
*  I'm afraid that's the stuff that got, you know, Trayvon Martin killed, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=552.6600000000001s)]
*  Tamir Rice killed, Michael Brown killed. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=558.2600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I believe officer Darren Smith literally talked about his presence and his strength as an [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=562.1s)]
*  excuse for killing him. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=567.46s)]
*  And this has happened to black men historically. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=568.82s)]
*  And so now we're in a dangerous space. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=571.46s)]
*  And that's why I wanted to be really, really clear to reporters today, how reckless and dangerous [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=573.62s)]
*  her statements were. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=578.98s)]
*  And she should know better. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=580.58s)]
*  I believe she knows better. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=582.26s)]
*  This is another reason why we need to teach the accurate history of America in our schools and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=584.1s)]
*  make sure African-American history is a part of that because her rhetoric and her behavior in [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=589.7800000000001s)]
*  Congress outside of me, pictures with the AR-15 with the squad behind her chasing David Hogg and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=595.38s)]
*  stalking him as he engaged in activism around gun violence, her rhetoric, her language, her behavior [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=603.46s)]
*  has been aggressive and intimidating since she's gotten into Congress. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=610.42s)]
*  Now she's trying to displace it onto me. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=613.78s)]
*  I want to say also that if this gesture, which you were doing is aggressive, that all of my [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=615.46s)]
*  paisans are in trouble. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=622.9s)]
*  That's New York City right there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=625.3s)]
*  But that is New York City. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=626.66s)]
*  But the other thing to get to your serious point, I don't want to... [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=627.86s)]
*  What I thought was, well, if she had said this without the video, like we had the video, right? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=633.4599999999999s)]
*  So you could look at the video and it was like, this is ridiculous. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=639.78s)]
*  But when someone says like, this black man is intimidating and physically aggressive, I mean, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=641.86s)]
*  yeah, that's a serious thing to say in the society in which we live and have lived for a long time. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=648.1s)]
*  And can have real consequences. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=653.38s)]
*  Again, throughout American history and not just about black men, but women of color as well. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=655.0600000000001s)]
*  And when I first got to Congress and I had my first conversation with the squad, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=660.34s)]
*  remember they were coming off of Donald Trump. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=664.6600000000001s)]
*  They would talk about the number of death threats they would receive after Trump would [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=666.9000000000001s)]
*  say something about them. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=671.86s)]
*  Send them back or something like that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=673.7s)]
*  Rise in death threats, have to increase security. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=675.94s)]
*  So this is dangerous territory. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=679.0600000000001s)]
*  We're walking in here. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=680.5s)]
*  We got to be very clear about that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=681.38s)]
*  And we need her to say on the record, one, she should apologize to me on the record. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=683.46s)]
*  Two, ask her directly, do you want physical violence to be inflicted upon Congressman Bowman? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=688.66s)]
*  And let her answer that question. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=695.06s)]
*  Because at the end of her statement, it was, we need to watch him. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=696.82s)]
*  That's almost like Donald Trump, you know, stand by and stand back to the Proud Boys in [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=701.3s)]
*  that debate a couple of years ago. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=707.22s)]
*  We need to watch him. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=708.98s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=710.58s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=713.5400000000001s)]
*  And again, this is why we have to teach history accurately so we can all be more enlightened [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=714.34s)]
*  as we govern. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=719.22s)]
*  I want to ask you about, you know, we played the tape of you and Thomas Massey and you [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=719.7800000000001s)]
*  had that exchange. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=724.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=724.82s)]
*  She said I shoved him, which I didn't shove. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=725.14s)]
*  Clearly you didn't. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=726.9000000000001s)]
*  Yes, it would be news if Congressman Jamal Bowman shoved Thomas Massey. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=729.3000000000001s)]
*  I saw that in the tape. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=732.82s)]
*  I thought, wait a second. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=733.62s)]
*  No. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=734.5s)]
*  What's the deal with these interactions? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=737.0600000000001s)]
*  Is this a thing you're doing now? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=740.0200000000001s)]
*  Is it just in the moment? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=741.7s)]
*  Are you like, I am doing this as a tactical thing or I can't help myself? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=744.5s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=751.22s)]
*  It's literally organic. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=752.1s)]
*  It just happens. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=753.94s)]
*  So the Massey thing, I wasn't yelling at him. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=754.6600000000001s)]
*  I was yelling at journalists to ask Republicans about what they found to do more. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=757.38s)]
*  He walked up. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=761.0600000000001s)]
*  And then he walked up and then that became a thing. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=761.46s)]
*  With Byron Donalds, we usually talk about sports as we walk down the steps. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=763.94s)]
*  I saw them approach him to ask him about the Santas. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=768.5s)]
*  So I started going at him like, yeah, I want to hear what you have to say. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=771.14s)]
*  It's really just who I am in terms of how I talk to people on a consistent basis. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=775.06s)]
*  So it's not really a thing that's become a thing. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=781.2199999999999s)]
*  And I get a lot of questions, this confrontational style. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't mean to be that way. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=787.9399999999999s)]
*  However, I am extremely frustrated consistently by the lack of action in Congress [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=790.5799999999999s)]
*  and how everyone is all about decorum and kids are dying every day from gun violence [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=797.46s)]
*  and one in five children go to bed hungry. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=803.3000000000001s)]
*  And we have all of these issues and we don't have the sense of urgency to do something about it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=805.62s)]
*  And people in our districts want us to do something about it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=810.34s)]
*  So it's authentically me. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=813.3000000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, it's like, okay, this place is obtuse. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=815.7s)]
*  It takes way too long to do anything. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=820.58s)]
*  And I'm not a lifelong politician or lawyer or business person. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=822.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm not rich. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=826.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm an educator. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=827.22s)]
*  So I'm coming in with that energy and hopefully we can get stuff done. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=828.5s)]
*  Let me ask you a follow-up on that gun violence question. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=833.22s)]
*  This is something that I'm so obsessed with at this point. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=835.62s)]
*  If you talk about violent crime, right, then the right will talk about violent crime all the time. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=838.9s)]
*  And they want to run ads and Democrats like you and Libs are soft on violent crime. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=844.58s)]
*  The second you call it gun violence, which is the most serious violent crime we have in the U.S., [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=848.4200000000001s)]
*  unquestionably, it's the most dangerous form of violent crime. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=852.6600000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden, like the political valence gets flipped. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=855.06s)]
*  And it's like, well, there's really nothing we can do about gun violence. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=857.3s)]
*  Violent crime, we got cops, all this stuff. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=859.4599999999999s)]
*  Gun violence, you know, what's going to happen? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=862.5s)]
*  It's so strange to me how much it's the same thing. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=865.3s)]
*  Like, it is the same thing. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=868.7399999999999s)]
*  Like America has too much gun violence. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=870.5s)]
*  It has too much violence. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  It has too many homicides. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=873.38s)]
*  Too many people die from this. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=874.7399999999999s)]
*  We need to bring that number down. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=876.5799999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=878.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=879.38s)]
*  I mean, yes. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=880.0999999999999s)]
*  But it's been quoted in totally different ways. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=880.9799999999999s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=883.14s)]
*  And it's why Congress is often like upside down world. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=885.38s)]
*  And Republicans will say these things. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=889.54s)]
*  Many of the many of supporters support what they say. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=892.1s)]
*  Many of their support support what they say. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=894.74s)]
*  And what I want for our party to do is push back and take back the narrative and be very [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=896.74s)]
*  clear on what we're talking about. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=901.94s)]
*  Do not acquiesce or cede ground to their talking points because we feel we need to be tougher on [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=903.78s)]
*  crime. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=911.06s)]
*  Talk about public safety. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=911.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=913.0600000000001s)]
*  Talk about public health. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=913.62s)]
*  I mean, you talk about poverty. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=915.14s)]
*  You're a principal. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=916.82s)]
*  I saw kids coming to school every day hungry, stressed, frustrated, living in public housing [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=917.46s)]
*  and we stop investing in. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_N2Uu4sxUQ&t=922.66s)]
