# Hayes: Overdose deaths are dropping. The reason why will surprise you.
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c)
*  Even allies of Donald Trump are now admitting that his plan for tariffs are going to drive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=0.0s)]
*  up the cost of pretty much everything for consumers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=4.16s)]
*  So why do it? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=6.48s)]
*  One of the ostensible reasons, he says he's launching this trade war, is to end the scourge [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=8.22s)]
*  of fentanyl, which is a real and enormous problem facing the U.S. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=12.88s)]
*  A new report issued by the CDC says fentanyl now replaces heroin as the deadliest drug [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=18.52s)]
*  in America. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=24.44s)]
*  Authorities overwhelmed so many deaths in Los Angeles the school district is now putting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=25.44s)]
*  the overdose reversing drug Narcan in every school. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=29.96s)]
*  A more than 1000% spike in overdose calls, likely caused by drugs laced with fentanyl. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=33.64s)]
*  It's an extremely powerful synthetic opioid that contributes to about 100,000 U.S. overdose [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=40.56s)]
*  deaths a year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  And for the past decade, it's been laced into lots of other drugs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  It's caused users of those drugs to overdose unwittingly. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=51.24s)]
*  The problem is massive. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  Back in 2021, for instance, U.S. life expectancy dropped to its lowest level in two decades. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=57.28s)]
*  And CDC data showed that even after COVID-19, of course, which was driving a lot of that, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=63.4s)]
*  drug overdoses, most notably synthetic opioids like fentanyl, were the primary drivers of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=68.76s)]
*  shorter American lifespans. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  So this is an enormous problem. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  And it's a problem that is so big, it doesn't have a fast or easy fix. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=79.56s)]
*  There's no satisfying silver bullet. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=85.48s)]
*  But something seems to be changing recently. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=88.56s)]
*  After years of relentless rises in overdose deaths, New York Times reports, the United [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=92.92s)]
*  States has seen a remarkable reversal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=97.48s)]
*  For seven straight months, according to federal data, drug fatalities have been declining. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=99.30000000000001s)]
*  The difference is dramatic. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=104.84s)]
*  It's the largest decrease on record. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=106.12s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of reasons at play here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=108.28s)]
*  For instance, more funding for better treatment, education and prevention matters. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=110.86s)]
*  It's largely coming from the federal government. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=115.44s)]
*  In fact, back in September, when people started first asking about this drop in overdose fatalities [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=116.44s)]
*  and its causes, Health and Human Services Secretary Javier Bracera told us on this show [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  about their strategy, that they had done harm reduction measures that were taking hold across [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=127.52s)]
*  the country, making test strips and Narcan, a drug that reverses an opioid overdose, more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  readily available. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=138.4s)]
*  So this was partly HHS federal policy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=139.4s)]
*  All of that was important, steadily helping to sort of beat back this scourge. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=143.0s)]
*  But drug policy experts tell the Times they believe there's another surprising reason. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  That's changes in the drug supply itself, which are in turn influencing how people are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  using drugs. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=156.2s)]
*  So for the first time since 2021, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, says the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=157.54s)]
*  potency of street fentanyl in America has gone down. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  Pure fentanyl is becoming scarcer and also more expensive, in part because of law enforcement [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=167.28s)]
*  efforts, the White House says. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=172.44s)]
*  There's another factor, and this brings us back to Trump and tariffs on what he's trying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=173.44s)]
*  to do now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=176.84s)]
*  Last year, President Biden had this big bilateral meeting with the Chinese president Xi in California. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=178.16s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this, but we covered it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=183.08s)]
*  He had a live press conference. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=185.52s)]
*  And the big takeaway from that meeting was that both sides signed onto an agreement on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=187.88s)]
*  stopping the flow of the chemical precursors that are largely generated in China and used [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=192.32s)]
*  to make fentanyl to stop the flow from China to Mexico and the U.S. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=198.16s)]
*  It was a rare area of open cooperation between U.S. and Chinese officials amidst a fraught [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=203.16s)]
*  relationship these days, helping reduce the supply chain of fentanyl in this country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=207.8s)]
*  So again, this is all a bunch of factors working together. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=212.12s)]
*  There's no simple silver bullet here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=215.04s)]
*  But all these policies combine, the harm reduction, the increased treatment, the test strips, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=217.62s)]
*  the attacking the precursor chemicals. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=222.76s)]
*  It seems to be working. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=225.78s)]
*  We're having an effect. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=227.08s)]
*  The fact that this is working is, I would contend, a story that almost no one in America [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=229.0s)]
*  knows. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  Wasn't part of the Democratic campaign. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's a good reminder of a sort of hard, well-worn truth. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=242.08s)]
*  Building things and fixing things is a lot more difficult than breaking them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=247.96s)]
*  Having difficult problems like an overdose epidemic requires a bunch of people coordinating [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=254.8s)]
*  their efforts. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=258.8s)]
*  And the doing of that work, of governing, is much, much harder than populist posturing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=260.52s)]
*  about the problems. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=266.56s)]
*  Which is what, to be fair, Donald Trump is quite skilled at. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=268.76s)]
*  When you lose a son or a daughter to fentanyl, or a wife or anybody else, but when you lose [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=274.0s)]
*  a son or daughter, your life is destroyed, their lives are destroyed, they've destroyed [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=278.78s)]
*  so many families. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=282.92s)]
*  It comes from Mexico. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=284.2s)]
*  Something's got to be done. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=286.56s)]
*  That's something for Trump is to get tough, to crack down and stop these other countries [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=288.6s)]
*  from humiliating us by flooding us with drugs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=292.72s)]
*  But again, there's a record to look at here, right? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=295.68s)]
*  Trump campaigned on stopping the fentanyl crisis when he won in 2016, and he created [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  a task force after he won. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=303.32s)]
*  And as you can see on this chart, despite all the hardline politics and his tough talk [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=304.64s)]
*  and his best efforts, what happened? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=309.0s)]
*  Oh, overdose deaths just kept going up on his watch. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=312.08s)]
*  They plateaued a bit in 2018 and then skyrocketed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=314.4s)]
*  Almost as if promises are easier than results. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=318.2s)]
*  But what's happening there in the end? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=321.76s)]
*  It's actually going down for the first time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  And this is the fundamental issue we face. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=324.28s)]
*  The guy that we just elected is not interested in the difficult, serious things you have [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=329.0s)]
*  to do to fix stuff. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=333.44s)]
*  But he was adept at channeling people's frustration, genuine and righteous, correct frustration [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=335.76s)]
*  and rage about things like 100,000 Americans dying of fentanyl every year, these big complex [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=341.52s)]
*  problems and making them feel seen and agreeing with them that the system sucks. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=346.52s)]
*  But that does not actually fix our problems or their problems. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=351.88s)]
*  This is not what he's in it for. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=355.79999999999995s)]
*  The good news here is that it is possible to make improvements in people's lives. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=359.12s)]
*  And sometimes we don't know how, sometimes we know some of the solutions and we have [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  to try a bunch of stuff and it takes hard work by a lot of people over a long time, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=367.48s)]
*  including thousands of those bad bureaucrats in the federal government. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=371.68s)]
*  That's the good news. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  The bad news is that I think it's become harder than ever for anyone, the Democratic Party [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  or the Paris campaign or Joe Biden in particular, to communicate and sell that basic truth to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=383.72s)]
*  the American people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1MRk6yHg0c&t=391.6s)]
