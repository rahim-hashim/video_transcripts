# Harrowing details of an Israeli family’s escape from Hamas
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4)
*  So at first I'm hearing this gunfire from the fields, but then I hear it from the road, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=0.0s)]
*  and then I hear it from the neighborhood, and then I hear it outside my window. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=5.78s)]
*  Then I hear shouting, and I understand Arabic, I understood exactly what was happening. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=9.92s)]
*  Basically I understood that Hamas has infiltrated our kibbutz, that there are terrorists outside [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=17.28s)]
*  my window. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=22.48s)]
*  And I'm locked in my house and inside my safe room with two young girls, and I don't know [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=23.96s)]
*  if anyone is going to come to save us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=30.72s)]
*  One of the most gripping accounts about what happened in Israel over the weekend that has [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  just stuck with me that I can't stop thinking about was from a reporter for the Israeli [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=36.44s)]
*  newspaper Haaretz. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=39.64s)]
*  His name is Amir Tibon. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=41.68s)]
*  He lives with his family in the kibbutz near Gaza border, and he spoke to the Atlantic's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Yair Rosenberg to tell him the story of how the attack unfolded and how they managed to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  improbably walk away with their lives. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=51.36s)]
*  And Yair Rosenberg, who conducted that interview, joins me now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=53.36s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=56.04s)]
*  It was just a grueling account. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=57.68s)]
*  Take me through what he told you about how this unfolded. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so Amir lives, as you said, right near the Gaza border. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=63.96s)]
*  It's a few football fields, and they're so close to the Gaza border that they don't have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=68.92s)]
*  an iron dome because it would be useless. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=74.12s)]
*  And so instead every home by law has a safe room, which is not what you think of as a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=76.84s)]
*  fancy room. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  It's just a reinforced concrete room that you put the kids into sleep, and then if you [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  hear rockets, as the parents, you run into that safe room. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  And this is because the way that iron dome works, the sort of trajectory, it's too close [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  to the border for it to work. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=92.92s)]
*  That's how close they are. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  And so what actually saves their lives, ironically, is that they fire mortars at the village before [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=96.44s)]
*  they invade on foot. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  And so they hear the sound of the mortar, they think, okay, this is another rocket attack [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  where the kids are sleeping in the safe room. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=107.68s)]
*  And they go running to the safe room and wait it out like we usually do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=110.2s)]
*  And then maybe as soon as there's a lull, we'll pick up and go. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  And they're starting to pack in the safe room, getting ready to do that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=115.36s)]
*  And then as you heard, Amir says, then he hears gunfire that they never hear. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=122.6s)]
*  That shouldn't be there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=123.6s)]
*  And it gets closer and closer. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=124.6s)]
*  Amir, you need to understand, as a reporter, he speaks Arabic, he wrote a biography of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=125.6s)]
*  the Palestinian president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  And he knows once he hears them talking what is going on, which is that there are literally [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=130.96s)]
*  terrorists in his house. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=134.72s)]
*  They're on a group text with the other families in the kibbutz. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=135.72s)]
*  And everyone's like, there are terrorists inside my house. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=139.72s)]
*  And so then he texts his colleague who does the military affairs correspondent for our [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  entrance and he says, this is going on in my house. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=147.0s)]
*  And his colleague writes back and says, yes, Amir, I know they're in your house, but they're [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=149.72s)]
*  actually in not just everybody's houses, they're in all of the border communities. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=153.0s)]
*  And that's when Amir got very, very frightened because then he realized, okay, it's one place [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  the army could dispatch someone. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  Maybe it's like one infiltration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=163.48s)]
*  If it's an entire border, there's no way they can get to us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  So there's this sort of palpable sense that comes through here, which is this shock of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=168.72s)]
*  the scale of the infiltration. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  And just also a sense that this sort of reliance or faith in the government, that the army [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  would be nearby and the realization that it is not, that it is at the moment overwhelmed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=180.56s)]
*  and not there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=186.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=187.28s)]
*  And the psychology of calling his father who was retired. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=188.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=190.96s)]
*  So that's where I go is he texts his colleague and then he texts his father and tells him [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=191.96s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=194.88s)]
*  They're in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=196.04s)]
*  They're an hour and 20 minutes away by car. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=197.04s)]
*  They say, we're coming. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=198.28s)]
*  Families are in their 60s. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=199.28s)]
*  And they just get on the road. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=201.56s)]
*  And his father's a retired general and he only has a pistol because he does not in fact [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=202.56s)]
*  hand out guns to just anybody, including retired service members. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=206.4s)]
*  And so he, but he has a pistol and he starts and makes his way there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=209.28s)]
*  And as the story goes, they keep encountering survivors, ambushes, all these things. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=212.88s)]
*  They go through the music festival. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=217.44s)]
*  You know, they pick up people who are walking away from the music festival and they take [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  them to safety. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  So they don't just keep going straight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=224.2s)]
*  What I find so remarkable, what I heard it is that if it was my kid, maybe I would just [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=225.48s)]
*  keep going straight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=229.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=230.6s)]
*  And like, you know, these people are alive, they'll be OK or something like that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=231.6s)]
*  But every single person they see, a wounded soldier, they see these refugees, these people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  have been injured at the music festival but are still alive and they keep taking them [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=237.84s)]
*  to safety. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=240.6s)]
*  Eventually they give away their car to take some people to the hospital. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=241.6s)]
*  So how does Amir's dad eventually get to knock out all this place where his son is and his [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=243.44s)]
*  granddaughters are? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=248.16s)]
*  He finds he bumps into another retired Israeli general who also just showed up because nobody [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=249.32s)]
*  else was there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=253.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=254.84s)]
*  And he had a civilian car. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=255.84s)]
*  It's not a jeep. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not armored. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  There's nothing like that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  It's just like a normal car you drive to work. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  And they get on the road and they just drive together. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  They meet up with some special forces who are preparing to go house to house, which [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=263.2s)]
*  is the most dangerous thing you can do in counterterrorism, try to get people out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=266.24s)]
*  And they link up. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=270.44s)]
*  And as Amir tells it, right, they can tell that something's going on because now there's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=271.44s)]
*  more gunfire but there are two kinds of guns. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=276.12s)]
*  And so they know there's a battle. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=278.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=279.48s)]
*  But you know what's going to happen. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=280.48s)]
*  It's getting closer and closer and closer to them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=281.48s)]
*  And then they hear his father's voice and his daughter says, grandfather is here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=282.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=286.8s)]
*  And they know they're safe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=287.8s)]
*  I want to read to you from the account. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=288.8s)]
*  We hear just hearing the gunfire getting closer and closer. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=289.8s)]
*  The girls had fallen asleep and now they woke up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=291.96s)]
*  I think it's 2 p.m. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=293.68s)]
*  They haven't had anything to eat since last night. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=294.68s)]
*  There's no light. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=297.12s)]
*  We don't have cell phones anymore. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=298.12s)]
*  So we can't even show them our faces. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=299.12s)]
*  And there's one sentence that is keeping them from falling apart and starting to cry. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=300.12s)]
*  I'm telling them grandfather is coming. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=303.48s)]
*  I tell them if we stay quiet, your grandfather will come and get us out of here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=305.56s)]
*  And at 4 p.m. after 10 hours like this, we hear a long bang on the window. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=309.16s)]
*  We hear the voice of my father, Galea, our oldest daughter says, Sabahigeya, grandfather [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=312.92s)]
*  is here. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  And that's when we all just start crying. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=318.24s)]
*  And that's when we knew we were safe. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=319.6s)]
*  He has very strong thoughts about the security failure. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=323.16s)]
*  This is obviously someone who is a journalist. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=327.6s)]
*  He's a learned man. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  He he's a very critical Netanyahu government. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  I think in the interview calls him the worst government Israel's ever had. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  I think he uses that phrase. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  But there is a sense of just that he said there was a social contract that we would [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  live here and the government would protect us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=343.58s)]
*  And they failed in that social contract. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=345.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=347.1s)]
*  So many countries, not just Israel, one of the ways you secure your borders is you put [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=348.1s)]
*  people on the borders because the idea is and this is actually this is something that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=351.5s)]
*  my wife was a Tomlin professor point out is in the Tomlin, they say that you don't destroy [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=355.42s)]
*  a village on the border, even if it's extremely sinful, because then the border itself will [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  erode and you might get invaded. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=362.1s)]
*  But this was a this is a general strategic thing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  So you put citizens on the border, but then you have to protect them, obviously, if they're [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=369.70000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  So no one's going to encroach on your land while people are there unless they want to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  attack. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=373.06s)]
*  And they expected right that the army would come and the army not only did it stop, it [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=374.26000000000005s)]
*  didn't stop people from getting in. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=378.58000000000004s)]
*  So one of the things he talks about in the piece is that there were there was there was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  a way that people were afraid that they would be attacked, but it wasn't on the ground. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=383.54s)]
*  It was underground. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=387.06s)]
*  In 2014, the last time Hamas and Israel fought on the ground in a ground invasion into Gaza, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=388.06s)]
*  Israel discovered a ton of tunnels, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=394.34000000000003s)]
*  the tunnels. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=395.38s)]
*  And this was talked about a lot by Israeli politicians and American politicians, the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=396.38s)]
*  tunnels, the tunnels, the tunnels. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=399.82s)]
*  And the irony is they understood, but they didn't understand. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=401.17999999999995s)]
*  They understood that these were they got intelligence and they realized, oh, these tunnels are literally [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=404.02s)]
*  under communities like Amir's. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=407.65999999999997s)]
*  And the goal was to literally pop up all at once. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=409.29999999999995s)]
*  The intelligence was 200 people all at once and just kill mass killing civilians and maybe [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=411.82s)]
*  kidnap some people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=417.58s)]
*  And in other words, exactly what we saw nine years later, basically. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=418.78s)]
*  But instead of going underground, they just came over the border. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=422.86s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=425.82s)]
*  Israel spent a lot of money closing all those tunnels, building effectively an underground [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=426.82s)]
*  wall. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=430.22s)]
*  But they didn't actually secure above ground nearly as well as they thought. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=431.22s)]
*  And that is why you end up with just a ground invasion right on land. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=434.54s)]
*  And so they understood the tunnels were a threat. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=438.94s)]
*  But I think this is something important to understand. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=441.18s)]
*  Amir did not say this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=442.82s)]
*  This is me talking to you as a reporter and analyst. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=443.82s)]
*  You have this intelligence in 2014 that they sort of uncovered by dumb luck because they [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=447.1s)]
*  go into this ground war with Hamas and they discover that Hamas was just about to execute [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=450.34s)]
*  this plan and they find these tunnels. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=453.65999999999997s)]
*  They want to mass kill civilians on the border. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=455.53999999999996s)]
*  And through dumb luck, another Netanyahu government escaped that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=457.58s)]
*  But they were almost sleepwalking into that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=460.7s)]
*  And at the time, I think a lot of reporters and analysts sort of dismissed it because [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=462.94s)]
*  they said, OK, they found this intelligence. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  Maybe Hamas wasn't serious. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=467.97999999999996s)]
*  Maybe it was just a plan. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=468.97999999999996s)]
*  Or maybe it's the idea for the security services releasing something just scam monger. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=469.97999999999996s)]
*  But the security services do that to reinforce the need for their existence. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=473.65999999999997s)]
*  But now we know that actually they just waited. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=478.58s)]
*  They just planned for another nine years and then they did it a different way. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=480.54s)]
*  Gary Rosenberg, who conducted that amazing interview in the Atlantic. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=484.38s)]
*  Thank you so much. Appreciate it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=487.7s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcDUu9d5g4&t=488.86s)]
