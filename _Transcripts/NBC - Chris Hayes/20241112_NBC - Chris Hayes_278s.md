# Don’t be bamboozled by these election postmortems, warns Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI)
*  All right, we're one week after the election and the left, center-left is in the midst of a giant reckoning about what went wrong for Kamala Harris and the Democrats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=0.0s)]
*  It reminds me of the last time Republicans did something like this. That was back in 2012 when Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=7.5s)]
*  In the wake of that defeat, which was, you know, a definitive but narrow defeat, the Republican National Committee launched a massive review of their failures that became known as the autopsy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=15.0s)]
*  They surveyed 36,000 people. They held 3000 group listening sessions. They hosted more than 50 focus groups. It was a real thing. It wasn't just a sort of we're pretending to listen thing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=26.0s)]
*  And by March of 2013, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, remember that guy? He was ready to announce the self-flagellating results. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=36.0s)]
*  When Republicans lost in November, it was a wake-up call. To get a fresh start, we had to be honest with ourselves and with our voters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=45.0s)]
*  We want to build our party and we want to do it with bold strokes to show that we're up to the challenge and we're done with business as usual. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=56.0s)]
*  Our message was weak. Our ground game was insufficient. We weren't inclusive. We were behind in both data and digital. And our primary and debate process needed improvement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=67.0s)]
*  So there's no one solution. There's a long list of them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=82.0s)]
*  Now, key on that long list was trying to win over the emerging Obama coalition by moving to the center on certain issues, specifically embracing comprehensive immigration reform. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=88.0s)]
*  The report warned, quote, if we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=98.0s)]
*  But of course, instead of heeding that advice, what happened in the chaotic years that followed was the Republican Party nominated a guy who called Mexican immigrants rapists, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=106.0s)]
*  promised to implement a ban of all billion Muslims entering the country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=116.0s)]
*  And after all that hand-wringing, the Republican Party tossed the entire project in the trash and Donald Trump won, securing an improbable victory in Electoral College, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=120.0s)]
*  basically doing sort of the opposite of what the autopsy said to do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=130.0s)]
*  So that was 2012 to 2016. You remember the Republicans also lost another election recently. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=135.0s)]
*  Do you remember this one? This was in 2020. Remember that one? Republicans lost that year and they lost the popular vote for the fourth time in a row, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=141.0s)]
*  which is the longest stretch for any major party since the 40s. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=149.0s)]
*  Now, you also recall there was not a lot of soul-searching. In fact, I would say it was basically the opposite. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=153.0s)]
*  Donald Trump insisted that the votes were there or they'd been stolen, that it was all a big lie, proceeded to foment a violent coup, was impeached for a second time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=162.0s)]
*  Some Republicans in the winning days of the administration ran for the exits. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=174.0s)]
*  But as a whole, there was no law autopsy. The party never engaged in any serious discourse about what they did wrong, little at the margins or how they could correct it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=177.0s)]
*  What to do? Win back voters. And we've been rejected by America four elections in a row. They were just like, no, we're going to do it again. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=185.0s)]
*  They went with the same guy again, who acted every bit as psychotic and malevolent as he did the first time around. Anyone. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=195.0s)]
*  Okay. So, yes, Democrats can go ahead, should go ahead, do all this sort of discourse, look at the data, argue about what happened, post-mortem hand-wringing, all that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=203.0s)]
*  I've participated in a lot of it. I've been spending a lot of time debating with folks, in discussion with people on my podcast, other places, thinking about it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=215.0s)]
*  But don't be bamboozled by anyone who says they have the one true answer. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=225.0s)]
*  Okay. We have seen the unexpected happen time and time again. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=232.0s)]
*  I mean, none of us could have imagined a former community organizer and law school professor and anti-war protester named Barack Hussein Obama sweeping to victory just four years after George W. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=238.0s)]
*  Bush's reelection. And we have no idea where we will be four years from now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ05uX3jdoI&t=252.0s)]
