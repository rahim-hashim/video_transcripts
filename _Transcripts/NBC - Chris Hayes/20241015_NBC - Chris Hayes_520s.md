# Harris warns ‘unhinged’ Trump is out for ‘unchecked power’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Eight decades ago, the United States joined [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=0.0s)]
*  an alliance of nations in a world war to defeat fascism. Millions of Americans fought and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=4.64s)]
*  sacrificed in that war, including the father and mother of General Mark Milley, who in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=9.84s)]
*  2019 would become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top-ranking general in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=15.8s)]
*  the U.S. military when Donald Trump was president. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=20.84s)]
*  And now Mark Milley is warning that fascism is taking hold again, not in Germany or Italy [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=23.72s)]
*  but here in America, telling journalist Bob Woodward that the biggest threat to democracy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=30.28s)]
*  and safety in the nation is its 45th president, the man he served under, the man who wants [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=34.88s)]
*  to be the 47th president, Donald Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=40.6s)]
*  As Woodward recounts in his new book, General Milley told him, quote, He is the most dangerous [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=43.92s)]
*  person ever. I had suspicions when I talked to you about his mental decline and so forth. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=48.56s)]
*  But now I realize he's a total fascist. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=52.68s)]
*  He's the most dangerous person in this country, a fascist to the core, Milley repeated to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=55.8s)]
*  me. I will never forget the intensity of his worry. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Former top general is warning that on Election Day, 21 days from now, America could elect [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=65.36s)]
*  a fascist to be president. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=71.32s)]
*  And Mark Milley is right, because Donald Trump is running a straightforwardly fascist campaign [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=73.4s)]
*  at this point. It's becoming harder to ignore as threats of violence and racism become [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=78.6s)]
*  increasingly central feature of his rhetoric and his rallies. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  It was on full display this week as he chose to hold a key rally in the heart of blue [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=88.24s)]
*  Colorado, not a battleground state, in the Denver suburb of Aurora, which is where for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=92.96s)]
*  weeks Trump and running mate G.D. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=98.36s)]
*  Vance have pushed a fake narrative that the city is paralyzed by gangs of migrants. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=99.8s)]
*  Now, to be clear, it's a bigoted lie. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=103.92s)]
*  Every bit is false and racist, as Trump's claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=106.08s)]
*  And just like they did in Springfield, local Republicans, including the Republican [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  mayor of the city of Aurora, Colorado, are calling out Trump's lies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=117.0s)]
*  But that doesn't stop him and his campaign from using Aurora to make their disgusting, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=121.76s)]
*  dishonest argument about an enemy within, complete with visuals saying America was under [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  occupation and needs liberating. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=132.84s)]
*  Trump aide Stephen Miller even led rally goers through two minutes of hate as he pointed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=135.96s)]
*  at scary photos of alleged migrant criminals. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=141.68s)]
*  Look at all these photos around me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=145.36s)]
*  Are these the kids you grew up with? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=148.16s)]
*  Are these the neighbors you were raised with? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=150.44s)]
*  Are these the neighbors that you want in your city? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  No, these are the criminal migrants that Kamala Harris brought into your community and as [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=158.36s)]
*  swiftly as they came, Donald Trump will send them back. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=164.56s)]
*  He's a creepy, weird guy, not a particularly charismatic speaker, but also not lacking in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  subtlety. Trump got right up and turned the fascism up to 11, amplifying the racist [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=178.28s)]
*  hatred of migrants, vowing to mobilize a state to use violence against them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=183.56s)]
*  Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=189.0s)]
*  dungeons of the Third World. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=196.92s)]
*  I'm announcing today that upon taking office, we will have an Operation Aurora at the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=199.04s)]
*  federal level. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=204.96s)]
*  To expedite the removals of these savage gangs, and I will invoke the Alien Enemies [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=205.88s)]
*  Act of 1798. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=220.64s)]
*  Yes, the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=223.2s)]
*  Trump is promising to round up migrants using a law passed under John Adams, nation's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=224.72s)]
*  second president, along with the Remember Alien and Sedition Acts. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=229.16s)]
*  That law was designed to allow the president to authorize the relocation, arrest or [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  deportation of any man older than 14 years old who hailed from a country at war with the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=237.56s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=242.12s)]
*  It was invoked by Woodrow Wilson to throw Germans out of the country in World War One, and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  it also led to the U.S. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=247.4s)]
*  internment of Japanese Americans during World War Two. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=248.72s)]
*  It's a disgusting stain on the history of American pluralistic democracy, and Donald [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=252.8s)]
*  Trump wants to use it to round people up on American streets. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=256.8s)]
*  And if you think you're safe because you're not a migrant, Trump would never use that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  power against you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, on Sunday, he talked about who he thinks the real enemy is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  I think the bigger problem are the people from within. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=270.32s)]
*  We have some very bad people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=274.48s)]
*  And I think they're the... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=278.08s)]
*  And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard or if really [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=279.2s)]
*  necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=284.36s)]
*  We have two enemies. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=288.92s)]
*  We have the outside enemy and then we have the enemy from within. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  And the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=294.16s)]
*  these countries. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=298.76s)]
*  Again, this is not complicated or controversial. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  This is just textbook fascist way of talking, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=302.6s)]
*  The idea that if you resist, you, your neighbors, your family could be domestic enemies of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=306.24s)]
*  the state, more dangerous than a foreign adversary. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=311.24s)]
*  And this is the campaign Donald Trump is running for president. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=314.64s)]
*  It's all out there for all of us to see. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  The only way it could be more fascist is if he painted Democrats as unworthy moral [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=319.8s)]
*  degenerates. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=323.48s)]
*  Kamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=325.36s)]
*  Kamala's for they them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=329.92s)]
*  President Trump is for you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=331.56s)]
*  I'm Donald J. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=333.04s)]
*  Trump and I approve this message. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=333.8s)]
*  That ad is being run by the Trump campaign Wall to Wall and Swing States on football [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=336.04s)]
*  weekends during major Major League Baseball playoffs. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  I've seen it dozens of dozens of times and they're making a bet here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=341.92s)]
*  Pretty straightforward bet. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=346.92s)]
*  He and the Trump campaign believe that that kind of thing, fear and bigotry is going [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=348.72s)]
*  to win them the election. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=352.64s)]
*  That's the bet of this fascist campaign is a war on truth on the people who tell [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=354.56s)]
*  truths. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  It promises a violent ultimate victory over every perceived enemy of Donald Trump's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=359.8s)]
*  using the power of the state, invoking the voice of the people against the stab in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  the back. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=368.12s)]
*  And he's running neck and neck in the polls with the sitting Democratic vice [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=370.24s)]
*  president. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=373.52s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=373.8s)]
*  Well, for one thing, after decades of far right media programming, a lot of Americans [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  are primed for an authoritarian leader. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=379.08s)]
*  I mean, there's some portion of the country, I mean, tens of millions of people that I [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=380.92s)]
*  think just affirmatively like the strongman pitch. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=384.32s)]
*  They want that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=387.2s)]
*  Now, of course, rarely works out for them in the long run. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=388.76s)]
*  Survivors of these kinds of regimes stand as evidence that no supporter is really safe [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=392.12s)]
*  from the regime they boost. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=396.2s)]
*  The second critical advantage fascism has in America today is that it's a very [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  radicalist. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=403.64s)]
*  The press, by and large, still doesn't know how to fully communicate the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  perilousness of our situation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=408.52s)]
*  In part, somewhat understandably, because Donald Trump is, in fact, the world's most [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=411.08s)]
*  famous liar. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=415.52s)]
*  He is such a liar that even many of his biggest supporters simply think he'll never [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=416.68s)]
*  do the things he says he'll do. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  As one Republican pollster told the New York Times this week, the normal rules just [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=424.52s)]
*  don't apply to Donald Trump. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=428.28s)]
*  And you've seen it time and time again. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=429.32s)]
*  That pollster said that his polling and focus groups indicated people think he says [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=430.68s)]
*  things for effect, that he's blustering because that's part of what he does. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=434.32s)]
*  His shtick. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=438.04s)]
*  They don't believe it's actually going to happen. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=439.16s)]
*  And again, I think this is defensible at some level. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=441.76s)]
*  Like, I get why that's the case, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=444.72s)]
*  The question whether you should take Trump seriously or not did get a definitive [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=447.32s)]
*  answer in 2021 in his last week's in office. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=452.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=456.2s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=457.16s)]
*  After he lost the 2020 election and attempted a coup to stay in power, including the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  inciting the deadly insurrection of the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0sahPWzVY&t=463.84s)]
