# 'Trickle-down approach failed America’: Hayes on the Biden case for ‘Bidenomics’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ)
*  Here's the thing about presidents and the economy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=0.0s)]
*  If you're the president, you're going to get credit if the economy is good and you're going [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  to get blamed if it's bad, whether or not you are the cause of either. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=5.78s)]
*  Here's a great example of that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=10.92s)]
*  Barack Obama and Democratic congressional majorities rescued the economy from the financial [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=12.64s)]
*  crisis of the previous Republican president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=16.88s)]
*  Then Donald Trump takes over and turns around and starts taking credit for the best economy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=20.3s)]
*  ever, even though he inherited an economy that had finally, after too long, gathered [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=24.16s)]
*  enough strength after the shock of 2008. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=29.2s)]
*  Here's what it looks like. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=31.64s)]
*  This is the line of growth, the growth domestic product, beginning in 2009 to January this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=32.8s)]
*  year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=38.16s)]
*  The shaded gray area in the middle there, that's the 2020 recession that happened because [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=39.16s)]
*  of COVID. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Here's the average growth that happened when Donald Trump took office. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=44.0s)]
*  See how that's just like a straight line? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=47.68s)]
*  There's no big disjuncture there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=49.64s)]
*  It's not like, oh, oh yeah, that's where Donald Trump took over. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=50.96s)]
*  The Trump economy just continued on the trajectory that had been laid for it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump still got credit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=58.4s)]
*  If you look at the polling, he got credit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=59.72s)]
*  In fact, presidents' political fortunes are so tied to the performance of the economy [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=61.4s)]
*  that decades of political science literature has shown the best way to predict reelection [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=66.16s)]
*  for a sitting incumbent president is basically what the economy is doing in the election [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=71.56s)]
*  year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=75.6s)]
*  Now, historically, when presidents oversee huge changes in economic fortunes, their fates [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=76.6s)]
*  then rest on that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=81.8s)]
*  So an example, 1981, Ronald Reagan takes over a time of stagflation and recession. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=83.84s)]
*  By 1994, the inflation had come down, the economy was growing, and Reagan ran with it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  It's morning again in America. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=96.0s)]
*  Today more men and women will go to work than ever before in our country's history. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=99.2s)]
*  With interest rates at about half the record highs of 1980, nearly 2,000 families today [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  will buy new homes more than at any time in the past four years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=109.44s)]
*  It's morning again in America. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=114.28s)]
*  Every time I see that, I'm like, that was a really good political ad. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=116.8s)]
*  Morning again in America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=120.44s)]
*  Similarly, Bill Clinton took over. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=121.88s)]
*  He also took over during recession. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=123.8s)]
*  But by 1996, the economy was roaring and he beat Bob Dole. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=125.88s)]
*  Now, Joe Biden took over the American economy as president, one of the weirdest, most intense [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=130.84s)]
*  crises we've ever seen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  It was something that the world hadn't seen in 100 years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  But he has turned it around. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=140.64s)]
*  Today he was in Chicago to take credit for what he called Bidenomics. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=143.04s)]
*  Folks, let me say it as clearly as I can. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=147.04s)]
*  The trickle-down approach failed the middle class. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=150.64s)]
*  It failed America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  Bidenomics is working. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  When I took office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  Today, the U.S. has the highest economic growth rate, leading the world economies since the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=164.36s)]
*  pandemic, the highest in the world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=170.52s)]
*  As Biden might say, that's true, folks, literally. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  No joke. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=176.68s)]
*  By all accounts, the Biden administration, the American economy is in a lot, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=177.8s)]
*  Less than two months into office, Democrats passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=181.24s)]
*  Party Line vote. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  Then they passed the infrastructure bill that was bipartisan. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  Then Democrats, along with some Republicans, passed the $52 billion Chips Act. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=190.2s)]
*  And then they went on with zero Republican support to pass the sweeping $750 billion [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  And all of that together really has changed the American economy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  Here's a graph, GDP among the G7, right, seven richest economies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  The yellow line, the top line there, represents the United States, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=211.6s)]
*  And the white dotted line in the middle represents pre-COVID GDP. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=216.92s)]
*  We are doing the best. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=221.55999999999997s)]
*  Again, that's not the seven richest economies, but the seven in the G7. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=222.55999999999997s)]
*  We are doing the best of any of our peers in the world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=225.48s)]
*  We have the highest post-pandemic growth. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=229.16s)]
*  Look, that yellow line on top, we're beating everyone. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=231.04s)]
*  Here's another graph of inflation among G7 countries, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  These are our peer countries. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  This is the one where you want to be on the bottom. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  The United States is the black line there, right where you'd want it to be. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=242.04s)]
*  That means we have the lowest inflation, meaning the highest growth and the lowest inflation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=245.04s)]
*  Here's a graph of the U.S. consumer price index, which measures everything you can think [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=249.64s)]
*  of from when Joe Biden took office in January 2021 to this May, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=253.44s)]
*  That's the measure of inflation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=257.86s)]
*  That red arrow on your screen is when Democrats passed the somewhat cheekily named, in my [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=260.08s)]
*  view, Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=265.68s)]
*  Look what happened after they passed the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Inflation reduced. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  It went down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=273.56s)]
*  Inflation actually slowed in May to the lowest rate in two years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=275.68s)]
*  Right now, here's where things stand. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=278.8s)]
*  After all the disruption, after all the difficulty and the headwinds, we have one of the strongest [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=281.44s)]
*  economies in the entire world, stronger than any of our peer countries with higher growth [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=286.76s)]
*  and lower inflation and a booming jobs market, possibly one of the strongest economies we [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=291.82s)]
*  have seen. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=296.56s)]
*  I mean, according to the latest estimate, under the Biden administration, the U.S. has [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=297.56s)]
*  created about 13.6 million jobs since Biden took office. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=301.32s)]
*  That is more than double the combined total of Trump's first three years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=305.48s)]
*  Part of that is due to COVID, of course, but it didn't have to necessarily come out that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=308.84s)]
*  way, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=312.8s)]
*  You get credit when you're there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=313.8s)]
*  The unemployment rate in May was just above the lowest level since 1969. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  Consumer confidence is now coming back up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=320.3s)]
*  It's its highest level since early 2022. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=322.36s)]
*  That's when inflation really started to bite. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=325.24s)]
*  Rating starts surged last month by the most and more than three decades. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=327.72s)]
*  And in the post-pandemic economy, low-income workers are making huge wage gains, historic [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=332.36s)]
*  wage gains. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=337.86s)]
*  We haven't seen them before. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=338.86s)]
*  We also have record investments in green energy, unbelievable amounts of clean energy now coming [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=339.86s)]
*  online. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=344.70000000000005s)]
*  We have unprecedented amounts of labor power, at least unprecedented in the 21st century, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=345.70000000000005s)]
*  that's for sure. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=350.24s)]
*  It has resulted in more unions forming and more strikes. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=351.24s)]
*  I mean, this is in total, if it continues this way, if there is a soft landing, if we [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=355.44s)]
*  avoid a recession, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=360.16s)]
*  It is one of the most impressive macroeconomic interventions in recent American history in [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=362.14000000000004s)]
*  the last 100 years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=368.56s)]
*  We end up in 2024 with these trends continuing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=369.56s)]
*  Joe Biden has one of the best economic stories to tell of any president in the last century, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  which is why he's going to be telling that story right here on MSNBC tomorrow. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=380.04s)]
*  In this room, when he sits down for a live studio interview here at 30 Rock with Nicole Wallace. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HfW2C7djQ&t=384.44s)]
