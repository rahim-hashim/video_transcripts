# Trump caught ‘cursing audibly’ during Stormy Daniels testimony
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s)
*  Since the start of this trial, Donald Trump has violated his gag order 10 times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=0.0s)]
*  Just this week on Monday, Trump was fined another $1,000 for doing a phone interview [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=5.68s)]
*  where he said the jury was picked so fast from a pool of 95% Democrats. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=10.24s)]
*  Now the judge gave him a stern warning, saying, quote, it appears the $1,000 fines are not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=15.36s)]
*  serving as a deterrent, which, yes, obviously, Judge. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=20.28s)]
*  The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=23.56s)]
*  You are the former president of the United States. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Also true. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=27.86s)]
*  I'm possibly the next president as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=28.86s)]
*  But he warned Trump that his continued willful violations of this court's orders threaten [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  the administration of justice, constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=35.74s)]
*  I cannot allow that to continue. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  It appears the judge was right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=43.18s)]
*  It is not serving as a deterrent because just early this morning, Trump posted this, quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=44.18s)]
*  I have just recently been told who the witness is today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=47.86s)]
*  Apparently references to Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=50.9s)]
*  This is unprecedented. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=52.78s)]
*  No time for lawyers to repair. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=53.86s)]
*  No leverage has ever run a trial in such a biased and partisan way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=55.7s)]
*  I should tell you the post was quickly deleted from his account. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=58.940000000000005s)]
*  Back with me at the table, MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin, former federal prosecutor Harry [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  Lippman. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=66.62s)]
*  I should say that post, again, on the line, not a direct violation, but it is about a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=67.62s)]
*  witness which gets into territory. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  So I want to read this part. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=73.84s)]
*  Do I have this? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=76.08s)]
*  Do I have it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=77.08s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=79.08s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=81.06s)]
*  There's a sidebar between Mershon and Todd Blanch at some point that happens. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=83.06s)]
*  You guys don't hear this, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=88.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=89.5s)]
*  Okay, so we're getting this later. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=90.5s)]
*  I understand your client is upset at this point, Judge Mershon, but he is cursing audibly [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=91.5s)]
*  and he is shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=99.1s)]
*  It is the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=101.78s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, I will talk to him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  The court. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=106.26s)]
*  So I'm speaking to you here at the bench because I don't want to embarrass him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=107.26s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, I will talk to him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=109.5s)]
*  The court, you need to speak to him. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=110.9s)]
*  I won't tolerate that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=112.06s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, I will talk to him. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=113.06s)]
*  That's pretty wild behavior from the defendant. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=115.62s)]
*  And yet I've seen this movie before, Chris. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=118.42s)]
*  This is my fourth Trump trial in 12 months and I've seen this before. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  I saw it at the Eugene Carroll trial. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=123.7s)]
*  I saw it at the civil fraud trial. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=125.14s)]
*  Remember, Trump did not attend the first of the Eugene Carroll trials. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=127.06s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=129.62s)]
*  And I'll venture a guess that it went better for him for not having been there, not just [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=130.62s)]
*  because he didn't testify, but because he does stuff like this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  At the second Eugene Carroll trial, he banged his hands on the table, looked at the jury, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=136.86s)]
*  when she was testifying. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=140.9s)]
*  It's never happened. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=142.3s)]
*  Audibly. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=143.54000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  You just cannot. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, just to be clear, take a step back. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  Like absolutely prohibitive. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=150.34s)]
*  The judge called it what it is. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=151.34s)]
*  Contemptuous. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=152.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's literally contemptuous. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  And he's also said before that he would not find a violation of the gag order suesponte, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=155.82000000000002s)]
*  meaning on his own without a motion. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=161.22000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, what the client does in court is also not extrajudicial, as he pointed out [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=162.9s)]
*  the other day. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  But I think he is dead serious when he talks to Blanche, which is why you hear this repeated [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=169.22s)]
*  incantation of, I will talk to him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=173.7s)]
*  I will talk to him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=175.58s)]
*  I don't think we saw any of that for the remainder of the day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=176.58s)]
*  But I think Trump is dancing on the head of a pin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=180.42s)]
*  The problem is the DA's office also knows that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=183.82s)]
*  And they know that Roshan is prepared to send Trump to jail for as little or as much time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=186.62s)]
*  up to 30 days as possible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=191.86s)]
*  And so if they come forward with another alleged violation, they know it has to be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=194.2s)]
*  a serious one that is worthy of the punishment that Judge Roshan has stated he's willing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  to impose. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=204.04s)]
*  But the big detail, I think he'll lie to you, is he deleted it after half an hour. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  He's nervous. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=209.92s)]
*  No, right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=210.92s)]
*  Yes, no, we said that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=211.92s)]
*  But my point being that, right, so there is something that's happening here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=212.92s)]
*  Now let me just ask the mistrial question, and then I want to get your sense of sort [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  of the day of Stormy Daniels and how she did, because we haven't talked about Kross yet. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  So just quickly on the mistrial motion, he says as a threshold matter, Mr. Blanch, I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=222.28s)]
*  agree there were things that would have been better left unsaid. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=229.16s)]
*  You said he was quite pointed on that, Harry. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=232.28s)]
*  In fact, sustained his own objection. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=233.64s)]
*  I think the witness was a little difficult to control, but ultimately I'm not going to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=235.36s)]
*  give a mistrial. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=238.72s)]
*  Is that about what you would anticipate? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=239.72s)]
*  At most. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=242.64s)]
*  I mean, look, it really wasn't something that could prejudice the entire proceedings, et [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=243.64s)]
*  cetera. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=248.8s)]
*  He had laid down these guardrails, and that was exactly where they kept in the questioning. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=250.36s)]
*  But it was really Stormy herself who really did go outside the answers to quite a bit. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=256.2s)]
*  So I don't think he was really flirting with the mistrial, but he wanted to, and he told [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=261.68s)]
*  the DA to take her back and caution her, shorten her answers, and she did. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=268.2s)]
*  I was thinking of Katherine Christian, our frequent guest here who worked in that office [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=273.64s)]
*  in that court for 25 years, who's like, people like to cross. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=276.76s)]
*  There's a lot of line crossing, and it's sort of, you know, you're kind of getting as much, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=280.44s)]
*  it's like in the playoffs, the NBA, like you're going to sort of push until you get the whistle, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  Like that's kind of the intent. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  So I want to get your sense. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  The cross seemed to me not that effective as I read it, but I was not in the room. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=292.68s)]
*  Did you think it was effective, Lisa? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=296.68s)]
*  I thought there were moments in time where there were inconsistencies in her story, and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=298.8s)]
*  she appeared to tie herself a little bit up into knots. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=303.76s)]
*  But on the whole, the tone that the defense took with her, which was combative from the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=306.4s)]
*  start. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=312.2s)]
*  And this is Susan Necklis, who hasn't done a ton of witnesses in this trial. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=313.2s)]
*  She hasn't, and my suspicion is because she was saving herself for the two big ones today. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=315.88s)]
*  And I expect that she'll be the one to cross-examine Michael Cohen. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=322.08s)]
*  Susan Necklis was incredibly well-prepared. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=325.4s)]
*  She knew that book that Stormy Daniels has written inside and out, and yet it didn't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=327.88s)]
*  quite pay off for her because she was combative with Stormy, and the tone was nasty to a point [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=332.8s)]
*  that I think the jury will ultimately find empathy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  Also, Stormy did get much more succinct in her answers and almost was more emboldened [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  by getting to answer leading questions, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=351.76s)]
*  The fact that she can say false and just stop right there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=354.76s)]
*  There was a few like weird kind of Perry Mason moments. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=358.0s)]
*  Textbook mistakes, I gotta say, on Necklis' part. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  You want a cross to be crisp and have the witness answer every question. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=364.88s)]
*  Yes, correct, correct. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=370.16s)]
*  And when you get to the point where you've implied you're lying, that's when you stop [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  and go to the next topic. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=375.56s)]
*  She went for broke repeatedly. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=377.0s)]
*  Like, you made it all up, haven't you? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=378.6s)]
*  False. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  And then she was stuck, and there were repeated sidebars also. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=382.68s)]
*  Her rhythm is everything on cross, and her rhythm was repeatedly broken. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=386.08s)]
*  It's so funny when you're in deposition and they're asking you these questions and you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  know you're saying yes succinctly because you're like, where's it going? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=394.11999999999995s)]
*  Where's it going? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=396.67999999999995s)]
*  Or you know that like, yes, yes, I know you've got an idea here, right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  What was your evaluation of her overall sort of credibility today in terms of what this [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=402.0s)]
*  witness meant for the case? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=407.96s)]
*  I thought it was strong because substantially the core of the story was sympathetic and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=410.12s)]
*  she substantiated everything. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=417.28s)]
*  But I found myself not certain. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=418.84s)]
*  I thought there were different members of the jury who reacted to her differently. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=421.32s)]
*  She was an unusual kind of witness, much more colorful, much more vivid and dramatic. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  So I thought overall fine, but I wouldn't be surprised if some among the jury were, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  a little bit nonplussed and I don't know how it'll go back there. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=440.04s)]
*  Remember, she's a witness. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=445.4s)]
*  Doesn't matter for the law. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=446.8s)]
*  She matters for the feeling of the case, the righteousness of the case. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=447.92s)]
*  Even if she were making it all up, it wouldn't matter for the charges and yet it would be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=451.68s)]
*  devastating for the case. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=455.92s)]
*  We want them to like her and I think they largely did. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=457.2s)]
*  I wondered though how you felt. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=461.16s)]
*  I was uncertain. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=463.52s)]
*  I think Stormy Daniels, as Kerry said at the very beginning, is sort of a complicated person [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=466.56s)]
*  and she's a very conversational person who had her own objectives in being a witness. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=471.04s)]
*  Again, I go back to the fact that for her, this was a traumatic event. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=475.88s)]
*  She wanted to tell her truth and her lived experience and how it fits into this case [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=480.36s)]
*  are not one and the same. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=486.16s)]
*  And that posed problems for the prosecution in the sense that Susan Necklis, I'm sorry, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  Susan Hoffinger, who took her direct examination, is an extremely experienced prosecutor. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=493.64000000000004s)]
*  She's not a person that would just lead a witness casually or erroneously. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=498.6s)]
*  And yet there were times where I felt like she was boxed and she didn't have any choice [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  but to ask leading questions to prevent Stormy Daniels from going on and on about things [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=506.6s)]
*  that Mershon had already warned were irrelevant or prejudicial or both. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=512.12s)]
*  It's really, really, really interesting stuff. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=517.12s)]
*  What she said. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  You're going to come back on Thursday and we'll see. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=520.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, they'll probably be redirect, we imagine. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=523.92s)]
*  And wow, what a day. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=527.68s)]
*  That was honestly, I cannot thank you both enough. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=529.3199999999999s)]
*  That was fantastic. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  You guys are putting in incredible work. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=533.3199999999999s)]
*  It was great. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  I feel like I, this is what I, I don't even need to be there. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  I got exactly what I needed. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=537.76s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, Harry Libman, thank you both. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=539.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fabLeCBjC3s&t=550.56s)]
