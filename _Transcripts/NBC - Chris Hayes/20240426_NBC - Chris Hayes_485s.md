# ‘All the king’s men’: Supreme Court ‘openly colluding' with Trump on immunity
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA)
*  As Donald Trump sat in a New York courtroom in his 2016 election interference trial, one of his other legal teams was in Washington, D.C., arguing before the Supreme Court that he should have immunity from his 2020 election interference case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, as we said last night on our special program last night, the arguments were frankly shocking. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=13.76s)]
*  Many legal observers, people I know personally who were no illusions about this court, genuinely taken aback by the fact that conservative justices seem to be almost openly colluding with Donald Trump, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=19.64s)]
*  reconceptualizing the president in real time as a sort of lawless dictator and just ignoring all the constitutional, textual, historical evidence that points in the other direction. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=32.08s)]
*  To my mind, one of the most galling things, and it didn't get mentioned yesterday during our arguments, but it's worth mentioning here, is that during Donald Trump's own impeachment trial for this very matter, his attempts to overturn the election, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=45.44s)]
*  his own lawyer before the nation and before the Senate argued the literal opposite of what his lawyer is now arguing to the Supreme Court. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=58.36s)]
*  The senator from Texas's question raises a very, very important point. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=69.24s)]
*  There is no such thing as a January exception to impeachment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=75.6s)]
*  There is only the text of the Constitution, which makes very clear that a former president is subject to criminal sanction after his presidency for any illegal acts he commits. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=80.52s)]
*  You did not hallucinate that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=94.6s)]
*  That was Donald Trump's lawyer in the Senate saying the following. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=96.36s)]
*  The text of the Constitution makes very clear that a former president is subject to criminal sanction after his presidency for any legal, illegal acts he commits. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  That was the argument Trump's lawyers used in 2021 to help avoid conviction in the Senate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=114.52s)]
*  Don't worry, you can vote to acquit him, and we all still know because it's obvious that he could face criminal sanctions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=119.28s)]
*  Now, his lawyers across the street in the Supreme Court three years later are making literally the opposite argument to a receptive Supreme Court. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=127.92s)]
*  As Jumel Bowie put it in The New York Times, Trump has asked the Supreme Court if he is in effect a king, and at least four members of the court, among them the so-called originalists, have said, in essence, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=139.88s)]
*  I'll have to think about it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=148.72s)]
*  Jumel Bowie, opinion columnist for The New York Times, joins me now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=150.27999999999997s)]
*  Jumel, I love your column today. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  I thought it was really fantastic work. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=155.04s)]
*  One of the things I liked about it was all the historical evidence you entered, which was bizarrely absent from all the originalists. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=159.0s)]
*  I mean, you got Trump's lawyer clinging like a life raft to one Ben Franklin quote, which he keeps throwing out there every time, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=168.16s)]
*  when there's just an enormous corpus of writing from folks who were actually at the Constitutional Convention, who were at state conventions saying, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=175.4s)]
*  early Supreme Court justices saying, like, obviously the president's not immune. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=182.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  I pulled that from the great historian's brief, kind of a collection of really excellent historians put together a brief with the Brennan Center basically kind of laying out, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=188.12s)]
*  here is all the evidence against the claim that the president is sort of criminally immune. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  But to be completely honest with you, even doing that feels like an extra like a silly exercise to some extent, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=203.92s)]
*  because because it's just to me at least self evident that the president is criminally liable for legal acts like a president, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  if a president who has criminal immunity. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=222.24s)]
*  So the president is a civil officer under the Constitution. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=224.6s)]
*  If that person's criminal immunity, they are no longer a president. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=229.68s)]
*  By definition, they are a king. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=233.28s)]
*  They are some other thing that stands above the entire system, but they're not a president. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=235.48s)]
*  And so it's just sort of like system breaking to suppose that the president is above the law in any in any sense. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=240.12s)]
*  And so you can marshal all of this historical evidence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=248.28s)]
*  I think it's worth doing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=250.44s)]
*  It's worth showing in detail that the people who constructed this thing thought a lot about this specific question and gave us pretty straightforward answers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=251.68s)]
*  They don't really require any interpretation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=262.04s)]
*  But I also think it's worth saying that, listen, by definition, the president has to be legally accountable. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=264.56s)]
*  Yeah, this really is a kind of go with your gut situation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=270.76s)]
*  Like, what is your intuition about this is correct as an American, as you know, the we threw off the tyranny of the monarch. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=273.6s)]
*  Like, no one is above the law. Like, that is correct. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=281.64s)]
*  And that's what the lower courts found. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=284.12s)]
*  The other way I agree with you that it feels like shadow boxing is and this, I think, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=285.72s)]
*  was what was so appalling about the arguments yesterday is they don't it feels like the fix is in that it's cooked, you know, that they don't they're not really listening or reasoning legally. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=290.52s)]
*  What they're doing is trying to find an out for him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. Right. I mean, I think the big the big tell the giveaway that they refuse to deal with the facts in question, right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=309.08s)]
*  They refuse to deal with the actual situation that we're facing. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=315.96s)]
*  They're spinning these hypotheticals. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=319.6s)]
*  What if president, you know, is afraid of being prosecuted and then they're going to stay in office? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=321.12s)]
*  It's like, yeah, what if. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  But like, what actually happened is that the president that was defeated in the election and then refused to leave and summon a mob to overturn the process by which he is supposed to leave. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=330.16s)]
*  And that wasn't because he was afraid of prosecution. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  If Donald Trump had just like went gently off into the night after losing, he could still run for real. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=344.96s)]
*  Run again. Like no one would no one would care. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. There wouldn't be a prosecution. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=354.84s)]
*  This is happening because he tried to overturn the process. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=357.0s)]
*  And so this isn't some sort of vengeful, you know, Biden's and vengeful Justice Department going after Trump because he signs a bills they didn't like. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=361.32s)]
*  It's because he he he did something genuinely transgressive and system threatening. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=369.84s)]
*  And the fact that the court just decided that this didn't matter. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  We're going to talk about abstractions and hypotheticals like this is a law school class is I think you're right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  It is the tell. It is telling us that the fixes them that they are trying to find a way to not have to come down hard on Trump. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=384.64s)]
*  I also felt a little bit like I was in a sort of like lefty postmodern undergrad classroom where like they're they're sort of like, well, who what president doesn't break the law. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=393.72s)]
*  They're all crooks. Really? It's like really. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  Is that is that the position of the Supreme Court? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=406.72s)]
*  Like, are they all correct? Like, I don't know. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=409.6s)]
*  I don't know. That's not what I thought you would think. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=411.56s)]
*  The last thing here just briefly is I think you and I share the part of what was upsetting to is that this isn't over yet. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=414.92s)]
*  And I'm worried about this court like deathly worried about what they have set up for us in the future. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=422.8s)]
*  Right. You know, at the very least, they've delayed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=429.32s)]
*  They delayed a trial. The trial will be delayed. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=433.68s)]
*  The public will not be able to get a sense. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=435.76s)]
*  No. The jury of citizens right decides that Trump is guilty here to think it's important information for the public to know. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=438.32s)]
*  And it's also Trump could win in November. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's setting up a constitutional crisis. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=448.16s)]
*  Setting up a situation in which Trump kills and tried to kill the investigation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=450.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Then we're entering a whole new a whole new chapter of American history in a bad way. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=456.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Jamal Bowie, as always. Thank you, sir. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFPB9PHSxA&t=462.0s)]
