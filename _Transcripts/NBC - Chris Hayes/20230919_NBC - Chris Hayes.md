# Republicans have not learned ‘obvious lesson’ on how to defeat Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM)
*  Right now, according to basically every poll that exists, Donald Trump is crushing everyone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Republican primary field. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=5.0s)]
*  Somehow, they have not learned what was probably the single most obvious important lesson of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=6.8s)]
*  when he crushed the previous field in 2016, and it is this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=11.72s)]
*  You cannot successfully defeat Donald Trump in a Republican primary by running to his [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=15.16s)]
*  right and insisting to the base that he is not a real conservative. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=19.96s)]
*  Remember, back in the 2016 cycle? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=24.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=27.44s)]
*  and discarded. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Newsflash, the Republican party has been fighting against a single-payer system for a decade. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single-payer system. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=42.44s)]
*  If people think Donald Trump's a conservative, prove it to me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=46.52s)]
*  I mean, really, can you trust Donald Trump to actually be a conservative? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=52.16s)]
*  I don't think so, and I think the conservative cause is worth fighting for. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=56.84s)]
*  I just don't believe Donald Trump is a reliable conservative Republican. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  Good luck with Paul Ryan trying to find a conservative agenda with this guy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=66.12s)]
*  No, good luck to you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=69.84s)]
*  The base didn't care. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=71.4s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=72.4s)]
*  Not only did none of that work, it probably helped Trump enormously. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=74.36s)]
*  He was viewed by the 2016 electorate as more moderate than Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  Yet, of course, all that meant nothing for how he governed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=81.68s)]
*  We knew that would be the case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  He signed the largest corporate tax cuts in history. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=86.0s)]
*  He appointed three Supreme Court justices with the explicit plan to overturn Roe v. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=88.72s)]
*  Wade, along with a slew of ideological lower court judges. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=93.24s)]
*  And yet, somehow, unbelievably, the Republicans in the field this time are doing it all over [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=97.84s)]
*  again, rewriting the same stop Trump script. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=102.32s)]
*  In 2016, Donald Trump promised to govern as a conservative, but he makes no such promise [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=106.8s)]
*  today. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=112.6s)]
*  I think those pro-life folks that we really want to stand with us, they're not standing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=113.6s)]
*  President Trump said he would negotiate with the Democrats and walk back away from what [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=118.8s)]
*  I believe where we need to be, which is a 15-week limit on the federal level. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=123.24s)]
*  I think if he's going into this saying he's going to make the Democrats happy with respect [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=127.0s)]
*  to right to life, I think all pro-lifers should know that he's preparing to sell you out. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  While they all worry about how conservative Trump is, they are making his job easier. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=138.92s)]
*  He's no longer competing the primary. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=144.64s)]
*  He's essentially moved on to the general election. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=145.92s)]
*  Those Republicans don't understand their own base. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=149.32s)]
*  They keep having to learn this lesson over and over, how Trump redefined conservatism [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=151.44s)]
*  and what it means. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXis43t9KIM&t=156.39999999999998s)]
