# ‘Gangsterism’: Ukraine agrees to minerals deal with Trump to secure U.S. support
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA)
*  Yesterday, on the three-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the UN General [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=0.0s)]
*  Assembly adopted two resolutions calling for an end to the war. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=4.92s)]
*  Notably, the United States joined Russia in voting against the first one, and the U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=8.56s)]
*  abstained from voting in its own second resolution, which acknowledged the loss of life on both [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=14.4s)]
*  sides but did not mention Russia's aggression or condemn the invasion. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=18.92s)]
*  The Trump administration abstained because it did not agree with amendments to the resolution [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=23.44s)]
*  that called out Russia, rightly, I would say, as the invading aggressor. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=27.12s)]
*  I mean, this is a shocking change from the U.S., and it comes after President Donald [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Trump decided to open direct negotiations with Russia last week on ending this war that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=36.92s)]
*  did not include the country that Russia invaded, Ukraine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=41.52s)]
*  Our country went from throwing bipartisan support behind Ukraine, the country that got [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=46.08s)]
*  invaded had its territory stolen by Russia, has been bombed to smithereens, onto the side [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=49.44s)]
*  of Russia, the country that did the invading. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=56.04s)]
*  Something that does not really happen that often in foreign affairs, certainly not in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=59.84s)]
*  American affairs. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=62.92s)]
*  Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman served as the director of European [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=64.64s)]
*  Affairs for National Security Council in Trump's first administration until he resigned in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=67.88s)]
*  February 2020. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=72.12s)]
*  He's the author of the new book, The Folly of Realism, How the West Deceived Itself About [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=73.12s)]
*  Russia and Betrayed Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=77.16s)]
*  It just came out today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=79.08s)]
*  You can get it wherever books are sold. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=80.08s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=81.72s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=82.72s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=83.72s)]
*  I'll go into specifics and then I want to talk about your book. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=84.76s)]
*  Have we ever seen a 180 of this magnitude at your time working in foreign policy? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=89.8s)]
*  It's not just in my time in foreign policy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=95.84s)]
*  I'm a history student and I can't think about a reversal that our country faced, transitioning [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=97.64s)]
*  between different administrations, Republican, Democrat, Democrat to Republican, that is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=103.28s)]
*  such an about face. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=107.16s)]
*  There's always some level of continuity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=109.56s)]
*  Foreign affairs, there's a famous line that politics ends at the nation's shores. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=112.44s)]
*  There tends to be some continuity. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=117.48s)]
*  This absolute 180 degree reversal is unprecedented. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=120.0s)]
*  To someone that says, yeah, Putin seems bad, Russia seems bad, they do seem like the aggressor, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=123.64s)]
*  but the war does seem like it's gone on for a while and does make sense to negotiate some [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=128.74s)]
*  peace. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=133.74s)]
*  So what's wrong with this? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=134.74s)]
*  I think if you have a path towards peace, that's great. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=135.88s)]
*  But if you're repeating the same mistakes that we've done for the past 30 years that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=139.96s)]
*  I talk about in the folly of realism, catering to Russia, conducting a Russia first policy, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=143.28s)]
*  succumbing to hopes that you could do more with Russia, that's what's being dangled in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=148.68s)]
*  front of Trump right now, or fears that Russia is going to escalate to war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  If you're repeating those same mistakes over and over, it doesn't get you closer to peace. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=158.6s)]
*  If anything, it's a huge setback to the agenda of peace because now Putin banks those gimmies, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=162.6s)]
*  that appeasement, and looks to do more. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=169.88s)]
*  He looks for complete capitulation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=172.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I'm always worried about appeasement analogies because they can be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=174.56s)]
*  over deployed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=180.16s)]
*  I've heard way too many Saddam Hussein, Neville Chamberlain during the run of the Iraq war. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=181.16s)]
*  But in the case here of what happened in Crimea particularly and then the escalation of Ukraine, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=188.44s)]
*  with no real provocation in between other than the Ukrainians deciding who they wanted [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=193.44s)]
*  to be their own leader, it does seem like it has some teeth. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=197.64s)]
*  Well, I think I'd like to take it in a more delicate way and talk about specifically this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  idea of hopes and fears, hopes that Russia could be integrated into the democratic order [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=206.92s)]
*  in the 90s, somewhat justified at the end of the Cold War, lots of aspirations for Russia [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  and Ukraine, fears that if you take a hard line to Russia with conditionality or condemnation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  that could break the relationship and you recede back into Cold War. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=223.64s)]
*  That may have been justified in the 90s. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=226.92s)]
*  By the time you get to the 2000s, it's absolutely clear that Russia is moving in the direction [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=228.76s)]
*  of a bad actor, whether it's the Chechen Wars, whether it's the graduation from mischief [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  making malign influence to outright hybrid warfare like they did mucking around in the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=236.84s)]
*  Ukrainians election or military aggression starting in Georgia and then graduating through [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=242.24s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  That is a clear case of the US not following its own best interests, somehow trying to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  pin Russia back and support the vulnerable allies so that they're harder targets. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=255.22s)]
*  We did none of that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=259.82s)]
*  One of the things, you know, I've been very sympathetic to through the years left critiques [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=260.82s)]
*  of sort of liberal internationalism, you know, even critiques of NATO, largely because there's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=264.86s)]
*  a hypocrisy tension inherited, like rules based international order and values. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=270.18s)]
*  But like, we need Saudi and we need the and we're not going to cross Israel on UN resolutions [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=274.94s)]
*  because they're our ally and we stand behind them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=282.46s)]
*  The particulars don't really matter there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=284.42s)]
*  So there's there's lots of room for that critique of hypocrisy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=286.82s)]
*  But the Trump alternative is a kind of almost gangsterism. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=289.82s)]
*  I mean, today we've got this news about the mineral deal, right? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=294.42s)]
*  Like what's in it for me? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  What's in it for us? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  Give us your mineral. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  Give us your treasure or we won't protect you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=301.64s)]
*  The interesting thing is that there there is maybe a right way of doing this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  There's some transactionality that's important. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=308.3s)]
*  The best relationships that we've had with with Ukraine with partners is when there's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=310.5s)]
*  a combination of values and interests. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=314.82s)]
*  If we could if Russia, if, correction, if Ukraine could hook the U.S. with mineral deals [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=317.44s)]
*  that are fair and Ukraine gets investment form, that could be something that garners [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=322.92s)]
*  the Trump administration's attention. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=327.22s)]
*  But it can't be gangsterism. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=329.14s)]
*  It has to be something that that serves both parties. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=330.14s)]
*  I think that's where we might get to, even though the soundbite is Trump wins. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=332.94s)]
*  You worked in the Trump White House. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=336.64s)]
*  You were sort of at the center of that first phone, the perfect phone call, the impeachment, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=338.8s)]
*  all that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=342.44s)]
*  Why is why what do you get? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=343.44s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=346.36s)]
*  Why is he hate Ukraine so much? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=347.36s)]
*  Why does he hate Zelensky? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  He hates it because he was caught up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=351.56s)]
*  That phone call that I reported precipitated the first impeachment and he blames Ukraine [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=354.24s)]
*  for that, right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=358.64s)]
*  Not his own corruption that precipitated it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  He blames other folks because he's an egotistical narcissist. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=363.62s)]
*  He wants to settle a score with Ukraine. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=367.46s)]
*  He also wants to cater to Putin, who he admires greatly, the strongman Machismo and things [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=369.5s)]
*  of that nature. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  So some of that is understandable. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  But what he's doing now actually is almost inexplicable. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=378.82s)]
*  It's almost like a Manchurian candidate type situation because there's nothing in it for [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=382.26s)]
*  him. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=388.46s)]
*  He's not going to get his deal. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=389.46s)]
*  Nor is there much political upside, I think. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=390.46s)]
*  That's the other thing about this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=392.4s)]
*  There's not the huge consistency for this particular foreign policy he's pursuing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=394.58s)]
*  Alexander Vindman, thank you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=397.85999999999996s)]
*  His new book, The Folly of Realism is out today. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=399.5s)]
*  You should check it out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyfGCXpTRNA&t=402.26s)]
