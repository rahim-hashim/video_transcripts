Bernie Sanders: “Netanyahu’s right wing government is blocking the borders and preventing the massive amount of aid that needs to get through from getting through and people are dying as a result.

# Bernie Sanders: ‘We should stop funding Netanyahu’s war machine’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g)
*  This morning was reported that the Republican Senate retreat would feature a very high profile [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=0.0s)]
*  keynote speaker, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=5.16s)]
*  The last minute he canceled, he was replaced with Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=9.0s)]
*  Herzog. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu makes no secret about his preference for Republicans in U.S. politics. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Recently he's been in conflict with President Joe Biden over the aims of Israel's continuing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=18.56s)]
*  war in Gaza as the situation on the ground gets more dire by the day, with more than [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=22.8s)]
*  30,000 Palestinians already dead, nearly 2 million internally displaced, and according [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=27.68s)]
*  to multiple NGOs, hundreds of thousands right now at risk of starvation across the territory. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=32.68s)]
*  Last week, after a state of the union address, Biden was caught on a hot mic essentially [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=40.96s)]
*  saying that things are going to change for Netanyahu. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=44.36s)]
*  Don't repeat this, I'm on a hot mic. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=47.36s)]
*  Much of that frustration centers around calls for a ceasefire, the desire to prevent an [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=63.8s)]
*  Israeli incursion into the city of Ra'afe. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=68.22s)]
*  That's sort of the last place where people sought refuge. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=70.48s)]
*  There's 1.4 million Palestinians now there in tents, like you see. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=74.24s)]
*  So just days later after the state of the union, Netanyahu insisted that that offensive, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  which the Biden administration opposes, will go forward. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=82.56s)]
*  Now a group of Democratic senators have sent a letter to the administration urging conditions [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=85.74s)]
*  on any armed shipments to Israel, saying, quote, the United States should not provide [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  military assistance to any country that interferes with U.S. humanitarian assistance. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  I'm joined now by the lead signatory of that letter, Independent Senator Bernie Sanders [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=99.64s)]
*  of Vermont. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=103.76s)]
*  Senator, what is your aim here with this letter? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=104.76s)]
*  Chris, my aim is to make it clear that Israel is breaking the law. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=109.56s)]
*  This is not debatable. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=116.48s)]
*  Section 6201 of the Foreign Policy Act, Foreign Assistance Act, makes it clear that any country [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=120.32s)]
*  that interferes with the provision of U.S. humanitarian aid will not get funding from [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  the United States of America. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=136.32s)]
*  And that's clearly what Israel is doing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=138.04s)]
*  What is going on, as you've just indicated, and I hope everybody understands it, is unprecedented. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=140.88s)]
*  It is unspeakable. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=147.4s)]
*  And it's not just tens of thousands of people have been killed and wounded. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=149.4s)]
*  At this moment, Chris, as we speak, hundreds of thousands of children are facing starvation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  And the reason for that is Netanyahu's right-wing government is blocking the borders and preventing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  the massive amount of aid that needs to get through from getting through. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=168.64s)]
*  And people are dying as a result. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=174.12s)]
*  That is in violation of American law. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=176.0s)]
*  We should stop funding Netanyahu's war machine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=178.7s)]
*  I should say here that the Israeli government, and particularly the unity government that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  is running the war since the attack by Hamas on October 7th, they say they're not blocking [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=186.16s)]
*  aid. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=191.44s)]
*  They say that they're blocking dual-use goods, that they're letting aid through, that it's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=192.44s)]
*  the fault of the aid groups or the U.S. or others. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  You do not seem swayed by that contention. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=200.52s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Everybody knows what's going on. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=204.4s)]
*  Several senators, Senator Van Hollen, Senator Merkley, were there at the border. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=206.08s)]
*  What they're doing is doing these checks, which take hours and hours and hours, and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=210.4s)]
*  slowing up the ability of trucks to get through. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=217.88s)]
*  Everybody knows that that's the case. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=221.26s)]
*  And that's got to change. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=223.76s)]
*  We cannot, as a nation, be complicit in the starvation of human beings and of children. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=225.0s)]
*  There's an urgent humanitarian issue here, which is the fact that, again, the UN World [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=234.96s)]
*  Food Program, Cindy McCain, people that don't have a particular political dog in the fight [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=242.28s)]
*  saying, look, this is an emergency situation of mass starvation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=248.16s)]
*  There's also a political ramification in domestic politics, and just the fact that it just seems [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=254.28s)]
*  clear increasingly that the politics for Joe Biden are basically the opposite of the politics [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=258.48s)]
*  for Prime Minister Netanyahu, that the longer the war goes in some ways, the more that he's [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=263.2s)]
*  spared from the possibility of calls for new elections, his coalition falling apart, whereas [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=268.24s)]
*  the longer this goes, the worse it is for the Democratic coalition, which is extremely [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=275.16s)]
*  torn apart on this issue. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  And I would argue, Chris, it's not just the Democratic base and young people who are very, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=282.56s)]
*  very distraught by what's going on, as they should be. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  It is people all across the board. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=292.8s)]
*  If you're a conservative Republican, you do not want America to be complicit in the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=294.48s)]
*  starvation of children. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=299.2s)]
*  And bottom line is the law is being broken. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=301.52s)]
*  The law has got to be enforced. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=305.8s)]
*  And if Israel does not open those borders and allow the thousands of trucks that are needed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=308.0s)]
*  to feed desperate people in, funding for the Israeli war machine should stop. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=312.64s)]
*  You have a new proposal this week that I just saw today, which I've actually been thinking [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  about because I've just been doing some research on the movement that pushed for the 40-hour [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=325.04s)]
*  work week or the eight-hour work day for a book I'm writing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=329.44s)]
*  And the legislation would move past that to a 32-hour work week with no loss of pay, that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=334.16s)]
*  it's not a radical idea. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=342.36s)]
*  It's time for working people to benefit from advances in AI, automation, new technology, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=343.68s)]
*  conscious corporate CEOs and wealthy stockholders on Wall Street. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=348.32s)]
*  How would legislation like that work, actually? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=351.92s)]
*  Well, for a start, the 40-hour week, as I recall, was established in 1940. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=354.28s)]
*  That is, 83, 84 years ago. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=362.68s)]
*  There have been a few modest changes in the economy over the last 84 years. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=366.8s)]
*  And what's gone on is workers today are far more productive. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=373.0s)]
*  I mean, think about all of the technology and equipment that's out there today. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  So the question that we're going to be asking tomorrow is who benefits from all of the changes [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=380.36s)]
*  that have taken place in the economy, the new technology, and, by the way, the artificial [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=385.92s)]
*  intelligence and robotics that's sitting around the corner that is going to transform [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  the entire economy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=395.92s)]
*  Most people, if you got a job today, it's going to be very different 10, 15 years ago [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=396.92s)]
*  from today if you have that job. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  So what we are saying is, with all of this new technology and increase in worker productivity, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=404.72s)]
*  workers should benefit from these changes, not just large corporations and the stockholders. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=410.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=416.88000000000005s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, as always, pleasure. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=417.88000000000005s)]
*  Sir, thank you for joining. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=419.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx-5NqHKV_g&t=434.72s)]
