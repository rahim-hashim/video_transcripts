# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 17
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was in court again today, along with the writer E. Jean Carroll, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=2.0s)]
*  the woman who a civil jury concluded, after a lengthy trial, lots of evidence, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=6.0s)]
*  had been both sexually assaulted and then subsequently defamed by Donald Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=10.0s)]
*  They found that he sexually assaulted her and defamed her. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=16.0s)]
*  And she is now suing for additional damages after Donald Trump continued to defame her. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=20.0s)]
*  Today, Trump was there to do what he did in his civil trial for fraud, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=25.0s)]
*  to basically make himself the center of attention, to upend the proceedings, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=29.0s)]
*  to further intimidate the people trying to hold him to account, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=33.0s)]
*  in short, to subvert the orderly working of justice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=36.0s)]
*  And today, he was very close to being thrown out of that courtroom. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=41.0s)]
*  More on that in a second. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=45.0s)]
*  Before I get to that, it's worth recounting the actual details here, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=47.0s)]
*  because it's easy for them to get overshadowed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=51.0s)]
*  Here's a story from a woman who was in court, starting two decades ago, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=54.0s)]
*  with an encounter in a Fifth Avenue department store and an assault in a dressing room. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=58.0s)]
*  The minute I was in there, he shut the door and pushed me up against the wall [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=64.0s)]
*  and bang, bang my head on the wall and kissed me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=68.0s)]
*  It was so shocking. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=74.0s)]
*  So he pushed me, held me with his shoulder, and I was wearing a coat dress and tights, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=76.0s)]
*  and so that's what... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=83.0s)]
*  He pulled him with both hands? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=86.0s)]
*  One. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=89.0s)]
*  And that was when it turned serious. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=91.0s)]
*  I realized that this was a fight. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=96.0s)]
*  It was against my will, and it hurt, and it was a fight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=101.0s)]
*  That is the definition of rape, one definition. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=106.0s)]
*  That's the definition. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=110.0s)]
*  That is the definition of rape. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=112.0s)]
*  Now, when E. Jean Carroll came forward, Trump attacked her again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=114.0s)]
*  He said, she's a liar, she just wants fame, she's not my type, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=118.0s)]
*  and he cannot stop being vicious and defamatory. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=122.0s)]
*  Even after a jury sat and heard evidence that you did this, you monster, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=126.0s)]
*  day in, day out he keeps doing it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=131.0s)]
*  Why is he choosing to go to court? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=133.0s)]
*  Why is he voluntarily drawing attention to the details of this despicable act? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=135.0s)]
*  He just won the Iowa caucuses, there are primaries ahead in New Hampshire and South Carolina. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=139.0s)]
*  Why in the middle of a presidential campaign would he direct everyone's attention to a case [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=143.0s)]
*  in which he has already been found liable for sexual assault? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=147.0s)]
*  I think there's an answer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=152.0s)]
*  It ties into the by now soul-deadening discourse taking place again [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=154.0s)]
*  on the roots of Trump's political appeal, which we've all watched for eight years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=159.0s)]
*  The core dynamic Trump has created is one in where he is constantly playing the victim, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=165.0s)]
*  who's always persecuted, but, and this is key, is always getting away with it anyway. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=170.0s)]
*  He's very open, very open in his campaign rallies about how his power [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=176.0s)]
*  comes from this combination of victimhood and impunity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=181.0s)]
*  I've been indicted more than Alphonse Capone. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=185.0s)]
*  You know who Alphonse Capone is? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=188.0s)]
*  The greatest gangster of all time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=192.0s)]
*  The greatest, right? I'm like Capone, who got away with it, until he didn't. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=194.0s)]
*  But getting away with it, that's the fantasy he is selling to so many people, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=199.0s)]
*  a fantasy that a lot of people really want to buy into. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=202.0s)]
*  Plenty of people daydream about what they might do in life without restraints, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=205.0s)]
*  what they would say or do to their boss or their coworker or their sister-in-law. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=209.0s)]
*  They want to imagine a world in which they, like Trump, can transgress in any way they want to, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=214.0s)]
*  in which they can say whatever they want to, whoever they want, and not face consequences, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=219.0s)]
*  in which they could lie, cheat, and steal, maybe even use force. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=223.0s)]
*  It's a sort of seductive mythos, I think particularly to a certain kind of man, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=227.0s)]
*  as the polling pairs out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=231.0s)]
*  Seductive mythos that he is selling and selling openly when he tells people, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=233.0s)]
*  I am your retribution. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=237.0s)]
*  And he's been selling it since the beginning of his political career eight years ago. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=239.0s)]
*  They say, I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=244.0s)]
*  Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=247.0s)]
*  and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay? It's like incredible. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=250.0s)]
*  People laugh there, but we learned back then in 2016, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=254.0s)]
*  this wasn't just a public campaign schtick for Trump. It's how he views himself. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=256.0s)]
*  We learned it when he was caught on tape in private talking about how he treats women. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=261.0s)]
*  I've got to use some Tic Tacs just in case they start kissing me. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=267.0s)]
*  You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful women. I just start kissing them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=270.0s)]
*  It's like a magnet. I just kiss. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=274.0s)]
*  I don't need to wait. And when you're starved, they let you do it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=276.0s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=279.0s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=280.0s)]
*  Grab them by the b****. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=281.0s)]
*  I can do anything. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=283.0s)]
*  You can do anything. That is the whole game, isn't it? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=285.0s)]
*  Consent doesn't matter. What other people want to do doesn't matter. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=288.0s)]
*  The law doesn't matter. It's a huge part of the appeal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=291.0s)]
*  And so here he is in court again, a place where people are required normally [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=297.0s)]
*  to submit themselves before the power of the law. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=302.0s)]
*  And if you've ever been on the wrong side of it, you know the power of the law [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=305.0s)]
*  in the United States is a serious thing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=308.0s)]
*  And how seriously did Trump take it today? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=311.0s)]
*  Well, his lawyers started out by asking for a delay in the trial so he could [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=313.0s)]
*  attend the funeral of his mother-in-law, which the judge denied, saying Trump is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=316.0s)]
*  under no requirement to attend the trial. He just wants to be there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=320.0s)]
*  That brought the first of several courtroom shouting matches. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=323.0s)]
*  Former President Trump, as E.G. and Carol has been testifying, is making some side commentary [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=329.0s)]
*  that her attorneys say is within earshot of the jury. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=334.0s)]
*  Former President Trump had a bunch of very noticeable reactions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=338.0s)]
*  He often shakes his head or mouths, that's not true. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=342.0s)]
*  That's when Judge Kaplan, for the second time today, reminded former President Trump [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=345.0s)]
*  that he should not be making comments that the jury could hear or that even audience [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=350.0s)]
*  members could hear, and then said, you have a right to attend, you do not have the right [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=354.0s)]
*  to be disruptive or to disregard court orders. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=360.0s)]
*  I hope that I do not have to remove you from the courtroom. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=363.0s)]
*  And guess how Donald Trump responded to Judge Kaplan saying that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=368.0s)]
*  He said, quote, I would love it. I would love it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=371.0s)]
*  Because he wants to be the victim here, mumbling under his breath, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=373.0s)]
*  clowering at the woman he's already been found to have assaulted in a dressing room, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=377.0s)]
*  and then defamed and continuing to defame, refusing to stop defaming her. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=381.0s)]
*  Even when it brings harassment and threats down upon her, even when confronted by a judge [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=387.0s)]
*  who knows Trump is angling to be thrown out of a court proceeding, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=391.0s)]
*  he does not even need to be attending because he wants to be a martyr. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=394.0s)]
*  This is the central focus of his campaign, as he made clear today, again, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=399.0s)]
*  by posting to social media, trashing the judge during the hearing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=404.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=408.0s)]
*  The point is that what Trump believes personally about himself, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=412.0s)]
*  and I think this is a genuine belief to the extent he has any self-awareness, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=416.0s)]
*  and what he is selling people in the base particularly, but generally, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=420.0s)]
*  is what he is also trying to achieve in the court and in the country, which is immunity. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=424.0s)]
*  Complete immunity. Total supremacy over everyone and everything, even the law. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=431.0s)]
*  And it is precisely what is so shocking about him as a person, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=440.0s)]
*  how long through sheer shameless and sociopathic behavior, he has been able to get away with it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=443.0s)]
*  It is also the reason why it is so important to bend him to the will of the law of our nation, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=449.0s)]
*  the law that we are all, as democratic citizens, collective participants in. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=457.0s)]
*  It's important at a moral level to hold him to account for his transgressions, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=463.0s)]
*  like defaming the woman he sexually assaulted or trying to end the republic. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=467.0s)]
*  It is important at a democratic level to demonstrate the supremacy of the rule of law [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=471.0s)]
*  and to show that no one is above it, but it is also supremely important politically. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=475.0s)]
*  The moments Trump has been politically weakest are the moments when he looks like a loser, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=483.0s)]
*  which is in the end what he truly, truly is. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=488.0s)]
*  Like after January 6th failed and he could not overturn the election, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=493.0s)]
*  and he flew out of town, apparently with a bunch of classified documents. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=496.0s)]
*  And after the 2022 midterms, when all his candidates lost [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=499.0s)]
*  and Republican party insiders again started grumbling about Trump being an albatross around their neck. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=502.0s)]
*  The con job he has been running his whole time in politics is that he is a winner. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=507.0s)]
*  The guy has never actually won a national majority of the votes, never. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=512.0s)]
*  And now he is working on the next phase of the con job, selling the notion [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=517.0s)]
*  that even the law itself cannot hold him and cannot restrain him, that he is sovereign over it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=521.0s)]
*  And so there's a million reasons the law has to hold Donald Trump to account. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=528.0s)]
*  But one of the biggest ones is to puncture the political myth of invulnerability [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=532.0s)]
*  and impunity that he is selling to his faithful base. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=536.0s)]
*  Yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate, urging his colleagues to pass a resolution [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=542.0s)]
*  asking for accountability that would require the Biden administration to report [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=548.0s)]
*  on possible, quote, violations of internationally recognized human rights by the government of Israel. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=551.0s)]
*  And to certify the, quote, no unit of the Israeli security forces receiving US assistance [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=557.0s)]
*  has committed any gross violations of human rights. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=562.0s)]
*  Only 11 senators of the 100 supported moving the resolution to even be considered for a vote. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=566.0s)]
*  The vast majority voted to just table it without even bringing it to a vote. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=572.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=576.0s)]
*  He chairs the Health, Education and Labor Committee. It's good to have you, Senator. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=579.0s)]
*  First, so some context here. My understanding is that it is already the case under US law [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=582.0s)]
*  and this is due to things that happened during the Cold War, which found the US was supplying arms [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=586.0s)]
*  to various governments that were using those arms then for human rights abuses. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=592.0s)]
*  That it's already a part of US law that the State Department has to certify when they give weapons to anyone. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=595.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter who it is, but those weapons are not being used to violate international humanitarian law. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=601.0s)]
*  That's right. Chris, this is a long-standing law that says something that's very sensible. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=606.0s)]
*  If the taxpayers of this country are providing military equipment to any nation on earth, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=611.0s)]
*  we have to make sure that that country is using it consistent with international law and human rights. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=617.0s)]
*  This is long-standing. That's correct. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=623.0s)]
*  And so you're explaining to me what the vote was on yesterday in that context. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=626.0s)]
*  What the vote was on yesterday was to have the State Department do a study on whether or not [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=632.0s)]
*  Israel was violating international law and human rights. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=641.0s)]
*  And given the fact that many of the weapons that Israel has used in the last hundred days [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=648.0s)]
*  come from the United States of America, we certainly have a right to know that. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=657.0s)]
*  My view from day one, Chris, has been that Israel has the right to respond to Hamas' barbaric attack on October 7th. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=662.0s)]
*  But they do not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=673.0s)]
*  which is what we are seeing right now. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=678.0s)]
*  And as you've just mentioned, the humanitarian situation in Gaza now is unbelievably bad, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=680.0s)]
*  and we're looking at the possibility of hundreds of thousands of children starving. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=687.0s)]
*  We cannot allow that to happen. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=692.0s)]
*  You know, we've had reporting throughout here, and I think it's quite established, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=694.0s)]
*  that the Biden administration, through Secretary Blinken, through Jake Sullivan, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=697.0s)]
*  even in person-to-person calls between the president and Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=701.0s)]
*  have been urging a timeline, a vision for a post-conflict form of reconstruction [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=707.0s)]
*  to ratchet down the intensity and scale of bombardment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=713.0s)]
*  As of yet, that doesn't seem like it's happening. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=717.0s)]
*  I just wonder, like, as a U.S. senator, does anyone have any sense of a timeline here? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=720.0s)]
*  Is this when this phase of this war might end? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=725.0s)]
*  I think there is a huge frustration when we see President Biden appropriately saying [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=731.0s)]
*  that he is concerned about indiscriminate bombing and the humanitarian disaster, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=738.0s)]
*  urging Netanyahu and his right-wing government to do the right thing. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=744.0s)]
*  And Netanyahu basically says, hey, you know, screw you. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=749.0s)]
*  We will do exactly what we want to do and when we want to do it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=752.0s)]
*  So the bombing right now, you know, what we are looking at, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=756.0s)]
*  I want people to appreciate this, 70 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=759.0s)]
*  You got 1.9 million people who have been displaced from their homes. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=768.0s)]
*  They need food, they need water, they need medical supplies. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=772.0s)]
*  As I mentioned a moment ago, children are now on the verge of starvation. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=775.0s)]
*  This is not what the people of America want when they provide billions of dollars to Israel. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=781.0s)]
*  And it's high time that we told Netanyahu that he's not getting another nickel [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=787.0s)]
*  unless he radically changes his attitude towards the Palestinian people and the nature of his military campaign. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=792.0s)]
*  Two of your colleagues, I think, if I'm not mistaken, I believe it was Senator Van Hollen and Senator Merkley, both went to Ra'a. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=801.0s)]
*  That, of course, is the border town between Gaza and Egypt proper. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=810.0s)]
*  And Jeff Merkley wrote this. I just want to read it to you and get your reaction because there's a bunch of issues in getting that humanitarian aid in. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=816.0s)]
*  Senator Merkley writing that trucks filled with food, water and medical supplies are lined up waiting to be granted entry into Gaza. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=822.0s)]
*  Even if all the items on a truck have been pre-approved by Israel to ensure they are not, quote, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=828.0s)]
*  dual use items that have a potential military purpose, Israeli authorities can and do still reject some items as an inspection site. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=832.0s)]
*  And then this is interesting. And if a single item is rejected, the entire truckload is rejected. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=839.0s)]
*  How concerned are people, you and your colleagues, about the specter of mass starvation, which is what the World Food Program is warning about? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=845.0s)]
*  To me, it's unbelievable. I mean, how do you say concerned? I would hope that we're more than concerned. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=853.0s)]
*  We are sitting here supplying the Netanyahu government with the arms they need and in the process of starving hundreds of thousands of children. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=860.0s)]
*  Concern is too a modesty word. We have got to act and we've got to act now. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=869.0s)]
*  What Merkley was talking about is not only is the bombing making it impossible for trucks, you know, if you're a truck driver trying to deliver your goods, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=875.0s)]
*  you're not going to do it when you're getting bombed. But in addition to that, what Israel has done at the border has made it extremely difficult for these trucks to get through. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=886.0s)]
*  And bottom line here is we cannot turn our backs on the enormous, the enormity of the suffering that is now taking place in Gaza. We have got to act. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=898.0s)]
*  You are a Jewish-American. You have family that was killed by Hitler. You've talked about that. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=908.0s)]
*  You're the closest I think any American Jewish candidate has ever come to the presidency or at least a nomination. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=916.0s)]
*  And you were in Israel in a kibbutz in your youth. This has been just a wrenching time, I think, for international and American Jews. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=924.0s)]
*  What do you feel and think as a Jew watching all this play out in these last hundred days? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=932.0s)]
*  Well, you know, Chris, what I would hope that no matter what my religious background is, I would respond accordingly. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=939.0s)]
*  You know, if this was taking place in Italy or in Ireland, I would feel the same way. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=948.0s)]
*  But I have to tell you, having spent months in Israel as a kid, knowing the history of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=954.0s)]
*  for me to see a right-wing Israeli government create this kind of misery in Gaza is extraordinarily upsetting. No question about that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=963.0s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time today. I appreciate it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=975.0s)]
*  A few hours ago, New York Democratic Congressman Daniel Goldman introduced a resolution to censure his fellow New Yorker, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=979.0s)]
*  the fourth most powerful Republican in the House, Belize Stefanik, for comments like this one. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=987.0s)]
*  Do you think that the people who stormed the Capitol should be held responsible to the full extent of the bomb? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=992.0s)]
*  I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages. I have concerns. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=998.0s)]
*  We have a role in Congress of oversight over our treatments of prisoners. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1003.0s)]
*  Hostages. She called them hostages, like the Israelis taken by Hamas. Hostages. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1008.0s)]
*  Congressman Goldman says that Stefanik's support for convicted criminals who've been charged with offenses against the United States government is, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1014.0s)]
*  quote, unacceptable for a member of Congress. And Congressman Goldman joins me now. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1020.0s)]
*  Congressman, was the hostages comment that tipped you over? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1025.0s)]
*  It was sort of the breaking point, I think. Her rhetoric and support for the January 6 insurrectionists [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1029.0s)]
*  and for generally the conspiracy theories peddled by the criminal defendant Donald Trump have been ratcheting up. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1036.0s)]
*  And it's one thing for a rank-and-file member to be saying those things. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1044.0s)]
*  It's altogether something different for the number four person in the leadership of the House to be attacking our democracy, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1048.0s)]
*  giving support to those who attacked this Capitol where I stand right now. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1056.0s)]
*  And instead of doing the work of the House and passing a budget and providing aid to our allies around the world [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1062.0s)]
*  and addressing the issues such as the border and inflation and other things that the American people care about. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1072.0s)]
*  But this is 2024, Chris. It's an election year. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1078.0s)]
*  And we just cannot have members of Congress who are lining up, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1081.0s)]
*  gearing up to subvert our democracy once again. And it just felt like we need to lay a marker down right now. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1087.0s)]
*  I don't care what Donald Trump says, but sitting members of Congress have a separate oath to this body and to our Constitution. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1095.0s)]
*  There's also an interesting context here reporting today from our own NBC and CNBC that there's discussions [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1103.0s)]
*  of at least Stefanik as a possible running mate to Donald Trump. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1110.0s)]
*  The thought of Stefanik as a possible choice for Vice President, Trump nodded approvingly. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1113.0s)]
*  She's a killer, he said according to the person at the event. I suspect he doesn't mean that literally. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1117.0s)]
*  And then further, if you're Trump, you want someone who's loyal above all else, a Republican campaign operative said. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1122.0s)]
*  And this is important, particularly because he sees Mike Pence as having made a fatal sin. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1128.0s)]
*  Of course, Mike Pence's fatal sin was preserving the republic in the face of the most concerted effort to destroy it since the Civil War. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1133.0s)]
*  Does it worry you that the way that your colleague Elise Stefanik appears to be auditioning for a role as Vice President is to basically give aid in comfort to the very people who tried to overturn the Constitutional Republic? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1143.0s)]
*  Well, not only that, Chris, she has refused to say that she will certify the election as Mike Pence did. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1157.0s)]
*  And that is clear. And it's been clear since 2019 when Elise Stefanik flipped a switch to go from a relatively low key, low level, rational Republican from upstate New York to Trump's biggest defender in the impeachment hearings and then beyond. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1166.0s)]
*  And it is clear that she is channeling Donald Trump in every way that she can trying to audition to become the vice president. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1187.0s)]
*  And given that she has no morals and no integrity because she completely flip flops in all of her policies and politics, for sure, you can't trust her to do the right thing. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1194.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what Donald Trump wants. He wants a sycophant. He wants a yes person who will do whatever he says. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1208.0s)]
*  And it is clear that Elise Stefanik in the run up to the 2024 election is trying to play that game. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uRu3jntV0&t=1215.0s)]
