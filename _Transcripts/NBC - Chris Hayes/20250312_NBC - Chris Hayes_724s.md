# 'I'm going': Tim Walz to hold town halls in Republican districts in wake of DOGE cuts
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA)
*  Governor Tim Walz is Democrat of Minnesota, a state heavily impacted by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's government purges and its trade war with Canada, which of course it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=4.12s)]
*  borders Governor Walz joins me now. Governor, great to have you in the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=7.8s)]
*  program. Thanks for having me, Chris. Let me just start with what this all looks [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=10.08s)]
*  like from your positions. Governor of Minnesota, obviously a state right next [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=16.4s)]
*  to Canada. I imagine you have good relationships. I imagine there's a lot [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=21.54s)]
*  of trade that goes on between your state and Canada. What does this, what has [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=24.52s)]
*  this all meant for your state? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, first, yeah, Minnesotans like Canadians. We share a lot and we share [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=32.46s)]
*  a great relationship. First of all, they're our biggest trading partners. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  It's incredibly disruptive. The number of people who cross the border both [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=40.54s)]
*  ways. Minnesotans going into Canada to work and Canadians coming into [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=44.1s)]
*  Minnesota. It's beneficial to both of our countries. Look, we get 90% of our [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=47.42s)]
*  potash, which is the fertilizer for our huge ag economy. That's real impacts on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=52.82s)]
*  real producers driving up costs for producers at a time when we can't sell [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=58.62s)]
*  our products because Donald Trump has this ridiculous trade war going on. And [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  just quite honestly, the chaos and the uncertainty that it causes. So many [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=66.74s)]
*  Minnesotans are asking when was Canada our enemy? And it makes no sense. It's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=71.9s)]
*  very difficult as a governor to be able to set and think about budgets, to be [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=77.14s)]
*  able to think about how are we going to continue to attract folks here? And then [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=81.24s)]
*  he starts as he did today, a day that I've dreaded as a teacher, as a parent [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=85.18s)]
*  of a student in public schools and as governor, a senseless attack on the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=90.34s)]
*  Department of Education. And I hope that your I think your viewers know this is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=94.5s)]
*  there's no plan behind this. Donald Trump doesn't know how anything works. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is this caricature that had a reality TV show that pretended like he [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  knew how to run businesses. The reality is he doesn't. As a governor, we have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  to make these things work. Local school districts have to understand what are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=113.38s)]
*  the impacts going to be when you lay off 1300 experts who are there to make sure [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=117.38s)]
*  that every one of our children get an equitable education. And so it's chaos. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=121.58s)]
*  And and look, I think he thrives in this. And then he tells his supporters that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=125.88s)]
*  only he can fix it. He's the guy who goes and starts the fire and then stands [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=129.78s)]
*  there and gives directions and acts like he knows how to put the fire out. He has [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=135.1s)]
*  no clue. So it's an arsonist with our economy. It's an arsonist with our [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=138.44s)]
*  institutions. He surrounds himself with people. The idea that the secretary of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=142.42s)]
*  Education would not know what IDA meant individuals disability and Education Act. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=147.66s)]
*  That's like your mechanic not knowing how to put air in your tire. And she's in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=154.22s)]
*  charge of this nation's educational progress. It is catastrophic. And look, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=158.17999999999998s)]
*  the short term numbers you were talking about, Chris, are real. And I think it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=162.61999999999998s)]
*  flips people like, oh, you know, people who say, you know, I voted for Donald [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=165.61999999999998s)]
*  Trump. I didn't know he would fire me. No kidding. No kidding. What I worry [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=169.78s)]
*  about is the generational change that this would make. Look, Ruby Bridges needed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=173.5s)]
*  to be escorted into those schools and the folks who went into Little Rock [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  because we didn't have an education department that ensured her civil rights [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  were respected. That's gone now. And my son, those of you, your viewers who are [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=186.82s)]
*  out there now who have individual education plans that let them thrive and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=191.62s)]
*  be their best people. What do they want us to do? Warehouse these kids, not give [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=195.02s)]
*  them the skills. And this is going to impact local schools directly. So it is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=198.92s)]
*  absolute chaos. And the question I ask is, you said it, Chris, he didn't run [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=203.44s)]
*  on this stuff. He told you lower prices. You know, one thing Linda McMahon and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=208.82s)]
*  her press conference did not say she did not use the word Children. If I'm not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=212.92s)]
*  mistaken, she did not talk about educational outcomes. They view [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  education as an expense. Just like Elon Musk talks about entitlement programs. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=219.98s)]
*  Those aren't entitlement programs. Those are the things keeping my mom alive. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=224.0s)]
*  She paid into Social Security for 80 years. She should get that money back. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=227.08s)]
*  And that's not what they believe. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=230.52s)]
*  I want to go back just on that Canada issue and then come back around the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  education cuts. I mean, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=237.08s)]
*  you know, this insanity about we're going to take Canada, 51st state calling [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Justin Trudeau governor. It's nuts and it's stupid and silly. But at a certain [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=243.68s)]
*  level, it's like I think across the border. Understandably, they're starting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=247.4s)]
*  to take it seriously. It's the only possible feasible rationale that anyone [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=251.2s)]
*  could kind of figure out for this trade war he's launching. And I wonder again, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=256.52s)]
*  as a border state with relationship, you've been talking to your, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=262.2s)]
*  other leaders in Canada. There was this 25% surcharge on your electricity, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=266.36s)]
*  which was dropped at the last second. Yeah, like, what do you make of those [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=270.02s)]
*  threats and what they mean to that relationship between our two nations? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=278.4s)]
*  Yeah. And so I don't blame the Canadians. They have to respond to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=278.6s)]
*  protect their sovereignty and what they're doing. And when Donald Trump [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=283.8s)]
*  puts these on and takes them off, this has so much more damage than him [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=287.0s)]
*  pretending like it didn't impact. We have become untrustworthy. And so if [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=291.0s)]
*  they are buying our soybeans or they're buying our corn, they're going [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=295.72s)]
*  to go look for a fair trading partner. And what Donald Trump doesn't [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  understand, he thinks what he did in 2018, where we subsidized farmers to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  the tune of about a dollar 63 bushel of soybeans just to keep them above [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=306.88s)]
*  water as he was fighting his trade war. We lost markets that took us decades [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=311.6s)]
*  to cultivate. They went to Brazil. They went to Argentina. And now we've [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=315.76s)]
*  got a surplus of products. Why input costs have gone up and nowhere to sell [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=320.04s)]
*  them. This is catastrophic. I had an event out on a farm. Look, I know many [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=324.04s)]
*  of those people didn't vote for us. But what I tell you what I know about [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=328.4s)]
*  farmers is they understand international trade a hell of a lot better than [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=331.68s)]
*  Donald Trump. And they know this is just ridiculous. I think he gets this in his [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=334.96s)]
*  head and it's, you know, it is like it's like pretend for him like it's not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  real. These are long term cultural shared values. They matter. And the damage [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=344.4s)]
*  that's being done, the lack of trust that's happening, very difficult. So [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  when I call Premier Ford or I call to Manitoba, they feel bad. They know that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  this is not all the American people doing it, but they feel like they have [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  no recourse except to respond accordingly. And again, he negotiated the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=363.64s)]
*  damn trade deal with them. If trade is so bad with Canada, he was the guy who [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=368.52s)]
*  signed the deal. This it defies logic. But look, I think is so he ran business. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=374.96s)]
*  He stiffed contractors. He stiffed workers. He doesn't pay his bills. He [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=381.0s)]
*  declares bankruptcy. The one thing is his claim that he's the business [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=385.52s)]
*  president, he is the worst possible business executive that I have ever [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=390.36s)]
*  witnessed. And I hope you know this what we need. I need the business community [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=394.76s)]
*  speak up. The Wall Street Journal. Thank you. Thank you for saying this is the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=398.76s)]
*  stupidest trade war because I've been saying it. And so now I can go back to my [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  constituents, Republican constituents and say this is the reality of what you're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=405.76s)]
*  facing. So I again there is going to be pain. The richness of a setting senator [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=410.62s)]
*  like Tommy Tuberville or Elon Musk only is going to have to endure pain. Are you [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=416.52s)]
*  kidding me? Are you kidding me? Again, this I think Americans have had it. I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  hope they've had it. And now we just need to do what we can do to make the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=426.88s)]
*  case. And look, I own this. We wouldn't be in this mess if we'd have won the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=429.84s)]
*  election. And we didn't. We have to make sure that Americans know it's not just [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=433.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump is bad, but we're offering them something better. And I [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=437.44s)]
*  think that's what we need to work on. Let me ask you about that. You said I [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=441.08s)]
*  own this. I mean, obviously I think look, after any election, there's just a [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=445.16s)]
*  billion different counterfactuals you can run. There's so many different [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  things. One of the things I've seen in a few interviews you've given, which I [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  think is interesting, is a sense that the campaign that you and your running [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=456.0s)]
*  mate Kamala Harris ran was risk averse, that it was careful. And one of the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  things I've really perceived is it seems to me there's a huge gap between Musk, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump and MAGA world, which seem recklessly risk seeking. I mean, truly, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=469.84s)]
*  there's no amount of risk they can't brook. Like they really want as much risk [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=475.08s)]
*  as possible. And Democrats who seem excessively risk averse, do you think [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=478.4s)]
*  it's a fair characterization? Am I on to something here? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=483.4s)]
*  No, I think you are. And look, I'm conservative. I believe that systems [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  work for a long time, that you don't have to break them. Are there [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=492.88s)]
*  improvements that need to be done? Yes. And I think we're guilty of some times [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  of not acting. Could the Department of Education be more efficient? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=499.24s)]
*  Absolutely. Are there things we can do there? To get rid of it makes no sense. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=502.2s)]
*  And so my point on this, and again, I'm probably the last person to give advice [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=506.08s)]
*  because we didn't get it done, but I just felt like Donald Trump floods the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=510.44s)]
*  zone with this. And I think, Chris, if you'd go ask the average American, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=513.6s)]
*  what does the Department of Education do? They might not have a clear vision of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=517.64s)]
*  it. So when Trump says it's a bunch of bureaucrats interfering with your local [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=521.8s)]
*  schools, give local control, we'll give you the money, it sounds pretty good. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=525.56s)]
*  And we have not provided what that alternative looks like. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=529.92s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think it's fair. And look, I do agree. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=534.16s)]
*  And I think there's a place for this, the disruptors, the folks that shake up [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=538.28s)]
*  systems in a way that are positive for people. But I keep saying this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=542.64s)]
*  What is the goal at the end of the day? What is the goal and where is it backed [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=546.92s)]
*  up? There's not a single economist backs tariffs. There's no one there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=551.04s)]
*  You know, Linda McMahon, I don't I bet she's never been in a public school. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=554.88s)]
*  What is she going to do to improve our students' outcomes and lives? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=558.6s)]
*  And there is a vacuum for us to fill. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=562.6s)]
*  We should get out there and fill it. Talk about what we're going to do. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=566.12s)]
*  Speaking of filling a vacuum, there was a word reported last week, the head of the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  Republican Congressional Committee that sort of, you know, is talking to those [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=574.28s)]
*  front line members, basically telling all members, House members, Republican [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=578.0s)]
*  members, don't have town halls. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=581.36s)]
*  It's not worth it. You're just going to get yelled at. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=583.24s)]
*  Don't do it. And a few Democrats and I think you're one of them have basically [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=585.76s)]
*  said, look, we'll do it if you've got if you've got an area of this country that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=589.4s)]
*  that you want to talk to someone and your own Republican rep won't talk to you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=593.64s)]
*  I'll go do it. Are you is that still an open offer from you? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=597.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going. I'm going Friday, I think I'm headed to Iowa. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=603.0s)]
*  I'm going to go I'm going to go do it. I've been asked by these folks if it works. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=607.0s)]
*  I I'm going to go use the platform that I have and hand them the megaphone to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=610.2s)]
*  talk about this. I wouldn't do those town halls if I were them either, because they [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=615.08s)]
*  have to defend cutting Medicare, cutting Medicaid, hurting their local public [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=618.44s)]
*  school, fighting a trade war with Canada, just the nonsense and defending President [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  Musk. So I went I lived through these in 2010 when the Tea Party was there and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  they're telling them that these are outside agitators. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=631.96s)]
*  I heard a few Democrats in 2010 try and say, oh, don't worry about it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=634.12s)]
*  These are outside educators. They were not. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=637.84s)]
*  They were my neighbors. And they were mad and confused about what was going to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=639.52s)]
*  happen. Now, did the Republicans gin those up? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=642.88s)]
*  Yeah, they threw fuel on that fire. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=645.68s)]
*  I'm going to go out there and make sure that those folks down in Iowa know that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=647.96s)]
*  their rep doesn't want to come talk to him. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=651.36s)]
*  But he voted for this stuff. He voted to defund these things. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=653.04s)]
*  He voted to make it impossible to talk to the VA and cut seventy thousand people to [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=656.04s)]
*  care for our veterans. By the way, many of those seventy thousand veterans [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=660.12s)]
*  themselves. So I think again, this is us going out and talking to people, making [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  the case that people are absolutely clear that both parties are not the same. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=668.92s)]
*  One stands with Elon Musk, the billionaires and the dismantling of America as we know [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  it and one that's going to be there for their families. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=678.68s)]
*  And if we're not out there, Donald Trump, all the podcasts, all the money will fill [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=681.04s)]
*  that void. So, yeah, I'm going. And if they ask, I'll go. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=685.68s)]
*  And look, I hope people show up at that town hall and say, look, Governor, what are [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=688.8399999999999s)]
*  you offering? Are you offering anything better? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=692.4s)]
*  That's fair. But not to turn your back and not do it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=694.16s)]
*  It's dangerous, dangerous. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=697.44s)]
*  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, thank you so much for your time tonight, sir. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  Come back anytime. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWu-ju7nRA&t=702.6s)]
