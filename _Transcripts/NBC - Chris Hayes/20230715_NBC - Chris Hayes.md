# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 14
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ)
*  A number of Republican candidates who are not under criminal indictment gathered in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Iowa today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=4.7s)]
*  A half dozen were at the Far-Right Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines to be interviewed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=5.7s)]
*  on stage by a disgraced former cable news host. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=10.0s)]
*  It is an important event in the state with the first nominating contest of the GOP primaries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  It's a particularly crucial moment for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who faces a widening [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  gap with frontrunner Donald Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=22.8s)]
*  A loss of support within the Murdoch media empire, which could be crucial, and growing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  concerns among big donors who are reportedly starting to look elsewhere. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=29.04s)]
*  DeSantis is now begging those donors to stay put. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=33.28s)]
*  In a confidential memo first obtained by NBC News, the campaign says not to worry about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=36.04s)]
*  its frequent missteps and sagging poll numbers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=40.24s)]
*  Why would donors ever worry about that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=42.96s)]
*  Brendan Buck served as a senior advisor to House speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=45.04s)]
*  He also worked for Ryan as the vice presidential nominee in 2012, and he joins me now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=48.64s)]
*  I think of you as a creature of the part of the GOP that would have both the staff level [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=54.32s)]
*  and the donor level been looking for an alternative to Trump and maybe look favorably on DeSantis [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=61.76s)]
*  coming out of that Florida election. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=69.64s)]
*  What do you think the issue is here? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=72.34s)]
*  Maybe everyone's just jumping the gun too early? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=73.8s)]
*  What's your assessment of where things stand? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  We may be jumping the gun a little too early, but I think there's two problems. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=79.38s)]
*  One is of strategy, and I think kind of getting to the point you were making. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=82.44s)]
*  One, Ron DeSantis seems to believe that there's a lane there for him among Trump voters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=86.6s)]
*  I think what Ron DeSantis needs to appreciate is all of the people who are not voting for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=93.48s)]
*  Donald Trump are looking for somebody else. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=99.24s)]
*  They're ready to turn the page, and yet he is running a very Trump-like campaign. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  He wants to appeal to Trump voters. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=106.2s)]
*  I think you have to look at people like me who are ready to turn the page, who are rooting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=108.24s)]
*  for someone to be someone unlike Donald Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=112.12s)]
*  So I don't quite understand where he thinks this big pool of votes is going to come from. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=115.48s)]
*  There's a big pool of votes who say they don't want to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  We've seen that, and I really think it's his own fault that there are 13 candidates now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  He waited so long, and he was so unimpressive when he first came out that he had all of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=127.76s)]
*  these people rush in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=132.56s)]
*  But I think that gets to the second point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=133.56s)]
*  One is I'm just not so sure he's very good at this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  I think there is a lack of charm that exists, and we've heard this a lot, and I was around [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=139.64s)]
*  him a bit in the House of Representatives. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Charmless is putting it nicely with this person, and it shows up when he's meeting with donors. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=146.64s)]
*  It shows up when he's out on the campaign trail. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, at some point, you have to make people feel something. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=155.64s)]
*  And for whatever you think about Donald Trump, he makes you feel something. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=158.92s)]
*  But Ron DeSantis is a bit dull, and so it makes people very easy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  It's not very hard for people to look at him and say, I'm not sure this is it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=166.28s)]
*  And they start looking at others, and that's what a lot of people are doing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this reading from the NBC News reporting that across the DeSantis political universe, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=173.56s)]
*  there's a heightened awareness of the importance of the early states. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=178.24s)]
*  The reality, he will burn out without strong performances there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=181.0s)]
*  From my understanding, if we don't see a bump in the polls, we're basically going to shut [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=184.28s)]
*  down the idea of a national operation, a DeSantis-aligned operative said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  I've, of course, seen this before, although, again, this is so early, and I've also seen [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=190.72s)]
*  a million ups and downs, so I'm not writing any obituaries here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=194.68s)]
*  But on your first point, this does strike me as the biggest thing, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  It's going to be Trump and someone else. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=201.28s)]
*  Like, in the end, Trump's not going to go away. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=204.16s)]
*  So it's going to be Trump and someone who is not Donald Trump at some point in this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  primary, or Trump's going to walk with it if it's split. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=211.8s)]
*  And he really doesn't seem to want, he hasn't figured out how to occupy that without being [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=215.28s)]
*  the anti-Trump, which I understand if you're running a Republican primary is difficult, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=220.8s)]
*  but you can be the alternative, and that has not been the foot forward that they have put rhetorically. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  So he puts out this four-page memo, and there are two sentences about how he might take on Donald Trump. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's your biggest problem. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=235.92s)]
*  Like, they're name-checking Doug Burgum in this memo, and they're talking about Tim Scott [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=237.76s)]
*  and punching down without a whole lot of focus on the person who is swamping them in the polling. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  So at some point, you have to realize your path is not being like Donald Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  So people are voting for him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=253.64s)]
*  You need to figure out how to take this person on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=255.0s)]
*  There are a few things in there that they're talking about doing, and that's fine. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=257.0s)]
*  But it seems like a complete lack of awareness of what the real dynamic is here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=261.44s)]
*  And people are going to start walking away from him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=265.24s)]
*  I think a lot of the polling for Ron DeSantis was people hoping that he's the best person, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=267.96s)]
*  that they've been told that he's the best alternative. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=274.36s)]
*  And they think that this is—look, I will take Ron DeSantis 100 times out of 100 over [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=276.32s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=280.56s)]
*  A lot of people like that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=281.6s)]
*  But I think it is largely his own fault that now he has to talk about Tim Scott instead [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=283.92s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=287.96s)]
*  If he had made this a one-on-one race from the very beginning, his memo talks about how [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=288.96s)]
*  they want to move on from questions about Donald Trump in contrast with Joe Biden. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=293.56s)]
*  Well, that's nice, but that's not actually how you're going to win this race. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  You have to take on the person who's beating you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=300.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=303.24s)]
*  That's not the race you're running. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=304.24s)]
*  You have to win the other one first. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=305.24s)]
*  And they're all doing that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=306.24s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=307.24s)]
*  He's not the only one doing that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=308.24s)]
*  There's an opportunity there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=310.44s)]
*  I mean, Chris Christie gets on TV every time he talks about this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=311.68s)]
*  I mean, getting attention is probably the hardest thing for a lot of these people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=314.88s)]
*  So I don't think Chris Christie is very viable in terms of his unfavorables. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=319.68s)]
*  But there is an audience, there is a conversation that is going to be had at some point between [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=324.0s)]
*  somebody and Donald Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  And if Ron DeSantis wants to be the alternative, he needs to welcome that conversation and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=330.16s)]
*  start it pretty soon. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=334.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=336.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=337.64s)]
*  And again, this is not, I would not have anyone, I would not hire myself out to give advice [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=338.64s)]
*  on Republican primary politics. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=344.48s)]
*  I don't necessarily have any keen comparative advantage there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=346.32s)]
*  But it does strike me that when you look at the polling, right, like Trump is at 50 percent, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=351.6s)]
*  he's at 55. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=356.0s)]
*  Like, you've got to think about how do we build out the 45? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=357.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, he's at 53 July 12th, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=362.56s)]
*  So that's 47 that are not there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=364.84s)]
*  Like, that's your, if you're picking the fruit off the tree, that's the low-hanging fruit. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=367.08s)]
*  How do I get that first 47? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=371.4s)]
*  When I get that, then I can worry about how do I eat into this guy's support. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=373.4s)]
*  But if you build up your strength, that's the thing that's going to bring people over, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=379.44s)]
*  I think, ultimately. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=383.64s)]
*  You've got to think about that first, I think. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=385.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  But like I said, there's still a lot of opportunities. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=389.23999999999995s)]
*  There's going to be a debate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=391.23999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump's not going to be there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=392.52s)]
*  And maybe he'll have a great performance and show that he is the alternate. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=393.72s)]
*  He is the person. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=396.6s)]
*  He has a lot of money. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=397.6s)]
*  There are a lot of people who are rooting for him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=398.6s)]
*  So, I mean, I don't think we can write him off quite yet, but absolutely. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=400.08s)]
*  He needs to consolidate that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  Again, I think it's his fault that there's a lot of people looking around right now. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  But he still has time to clean that up. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=408.04s)]
*  Or else you're going to start here and talk about Glenn Youngkin and Brian Kemp getting in. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  Because there are a lot of normie Republicans who are ready to look for somebody else. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=413.12s)]
*  And there's a big pool that I think he needs to be a little more focused on. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=419.44s)]
*  That, yeah, the normie Republican vote is the one to watch here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=423.92s)]
*  Brendan Buck, thank you very much. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=427.44s)]
*  In Ohio, early voting began this week in a rare and, frankly, onerous August election [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=431.44s)]
*  that was shoved onto the calendar by the state's gerrymandered Republican legislature. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=436.48s)]
*  It is a last-minute, desperate attempt by Republican lawmakers to stop their own voters [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  from approving a fall election day ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=447.04s)]
*  into the Ohio state constitution. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=452.16s)]
*  This August ballot measure, a few months before then, would raise the threshold needed to pass [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60 percent. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=459.92s)]
*  Meaning that if this one's successful, which they're hoping to sort of sneak past people, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=464.0s)]
*  then the abortion rights amendment that's going to be on the ballot in the fall would [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=468.24s)]
*  have to win over 60 percent of the vote as opposed to a simple majority. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  Not long ago, these same Republicans decried August elections, voted to ban, effectively, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=476.16s)]
*  most of them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=480.88s)]
*  But there are no lengths to which they will not go to make sure that every woman who gets [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=481.92s)]
*  pregnant in Ohio is forced to give birth. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=486.24s)]
*  David Pepper is a former chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, author of the new book, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=489.84s)]
*  Saving Democracy, a user's manual for every American. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=494.0s)]
*  He's been chronicling all the ongoing anti-democratic efforts of Republicans in Ohio [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=496.64s)]
*  and states across the country. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=500.88s)]
*  David, great to have you on. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=502.24s)]
*  I continue to think this is one of the most sort of like [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  bald-faced brazen stunts that any Republican legislature has pulled. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  How are things going with what's now called issue one in your state? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  It is bold-faced. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=517.84s)]
*  And what we're seeing here is a Republican party that's gotten away with lawlessness [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=518.8s)]
*  for the last couple of years. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  And as we see everywhere in the country, when someone or some entity feels no accountability [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=523.12s)]
*  for being lawless, they double down, they triple down, and that's what this is. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=528.64s)]
*  The first week of early vote is underway, and it seems to be off to a good start. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=532.48s)]
*  We're seeing in more Democratic-leaning counties that we presume will be more likely to vote no. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  Five in 10 times the turnout of last August in more rural Republican-leaning counties. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  It's been two to four times, maybe. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  So clearly, people, you know, the whole point of an August election for them was [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=550.4799999999999s)]
*  do it when no one's paying attention, do it when people are offering summer break or something. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=554.8s)]
*  And the good news is people are working incredibly hard to basically knock on every door, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=559.68s)]
*  make every phone call, send postcards so that people are seeing what this is and how, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=564.72s)]
*  as you say, blatant and attempted is to basically lock in the minority rule when it comes to this [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=570.72s)]
*  November beyond. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=576.24s)]
*  And it seems to at least be off to a good start now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=577.36s)]
*  People, again, it's not August 8th, the election. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=580.32s)]
*  It's between now and August 8th. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  The more that people vote early, the better. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's off to a decent start. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=586.4s)]
*  So for the folks that are—it is called issue one, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=590.0s)]
*  The folks that want to keep abortion banned or ban abortion in Ohio want a yes. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=593.36s)]
*  The folks that want to keep that threshold at 50 percent are voting no. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=597.52s)]
*  And I was wondering how the yes folks, right, the opponents of abortion rights and people [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=602.64s)]
*  were trying to push to make it harder to amend the Constitution were going to message it, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=606.88s)]
*  because at one level saying make it hard to amend the Constitution is going to be hard messaging. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=610.56s)]
*  And then if you go to the real issue, right, abortion, that's going to be hard messaging. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=614.96s)]
*  So I was not surprised to see that this is one of the ads that the pro issue one folks [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=618.8s)]
*  are running about, of course, trans folks. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=623.92s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=627.3599999999999s)]
*  You promised you'd keep the bad guys away. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=628.4799999999999s)]
*  Protect her. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=632.24s)]
*  Now's your chance. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=633.76s)]
*  Out-of-state special interests that put trans ideology in classrooms and encourage sex [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=635.12s)]
*  changes for kids are hiding behind slick ads. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  Don't be fooled. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  Don't. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=645.36s)]
*  We saw messaging like this on Michigan when they had a state constitutional amendment on abortion. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=647.76s)]
*  What do you think of those ads? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=652.88s)]
*  I don't even understand how that has any relevance to the issue. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=655.04s)]
*  One. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=658.72s)]
*  Here's the problem for them. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=659.04s)]
*  Not only is abortion at 60 percent in Ohio, like Iowa, so they can't talk about it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=660.48s)]
*  They literally had a polling call that someone leaked and they said, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=665.92s)]
*  whatever we do, don't make out an abortion. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=669.2s)]
*  But the other thing they're trying to do, we think about is they're trying [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=672.32s)]
*  to convince a group of people, Ohioans, to take power from themselves and give it to politicians [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=675.12s)]
*  who happen to be most corrupt politicians in the country. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=681.44s)]
*  That's a really hard thing to ask. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  Most people in America right now aren't exactly excited to give more power to politicians, so [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=686.16s)]
*  they can't run on what they're doing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=692.32s)]
*  So it's got to be one lie after the next or an ad like that, which is totally changing the subject, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=694.24s)]
*  has nothing to do with what's on the ballot in August. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=700.4s)]
*  They really are stuck without a message. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=703.44s)]
*  I think that's why you see some of the officials behind this are lashing out right now, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=705.2s)]
*  because I think it's not going very well. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=709.76s)]
*  The ads are absurd because the heart of their argument is offensive. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=711.84s)]
*  And that's why we're seeing Kasich, Bob Taft, the Libertarian Party and others [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=716.08s)]
*  all coming together and saying, even if they happen to be against abortion access, this is crazy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=721.44s)]
*  This is absolutely undemocratic. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  And so we see this broad coalition against it, because as you said, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=729.2s)]
*  it's so aggressive, it's so illegitimate, and it's been done in such an inappropriate way, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=732.64s)]
*  scheduling on a date that they made it illegal only months ago. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  You just called it one of the most corrupt state houses in the country. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=742.4799999999999s)]
*  And of course, that's always very, very competitive category. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=745.3599999999999s)]
*  But if I'm not mistaken, the former Republican speaker of the Ohio House, if I'm not mistaken, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  was recently sentenced to quite a long sentence for a big corruption conviction. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=753.92s)]
*  Yeah, he just got sentenced to 20 years two weeks ago or three weeks ago. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=758.88s)]
*  So they are literally asking, as the biggest bribery scandal in Ohio history plays out, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  hey, why don't we give those people more power? And why don't we lock the politicians, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=768.16s)]
*  and why don't we lock the voters of Ohio more out of their government so they can hold the most [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  corrupt state house accountable? By the way, when I say that, it's not me saying it, that was the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=778.2399999999999s)]
*  headline in USA Today a couple of years ago when this bribery scandal first broke. That's what the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  FBI considered the most corrupt state house in the country right here in Ohio. There's been not [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=788.0s)]
*  one reform to actually improve the ethics or lawlessness of Ohio's state house since that [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=793.36s)]
*  scandal. The only actually make them even less accountable than before, even though before is [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=800.72s)]
*  what led to the largest bribery scandal in the history of Ohio. So special interests are lining [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=807.36s)]
*  up to support this thing because they know this will mean they have more of a lock on the state [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=811.76s)]
*  house, and the people who don't like what they're doing can do less about it than they can today [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=816.0s)]
*  if this thing passes. It really is an audacious thing to just shove this thing in August, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=822.08s)]
*  say vote to raise the threshold to 60%. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=828.0s)]
*  but we'll see what the voters of Ohio think about it. I was just saying, they're just saying take [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=833.84s)]
*  away your own power while we maintain the corrupt system we have. It's a terrible argument, which is [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=839.36s)]
*  why you have the absurd ad you just showed. They have to change the subject. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=844.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlSXmGtFAaQ&t=874.08s)]
