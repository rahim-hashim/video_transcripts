# ‘Do they think we’re stupid?’: Melania Trump backs abortion rights just before election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis)
*  That's not the biggest story to come from the memoir's promotion so far. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=0.0s)]
*  So far the big bombshell is Melania Trump's new public defense of abortion rights. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=3.0s)]
*  Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=9.0s)]
*  Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=15.0s)]
*  Individual freedom. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=24.0s)]
*  What does my body, my choice really mean? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=27.0s)]
*  What on earth? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=38.0s)]
*  Now for his part, Melania's husband, who you may recall killed Roe v. Wade, consigning millions of women to have no control over their bodies, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=40.0s)]
*  brushed it off as the heartfelt opinion of his beloved and independent wife. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=47.0s)]
*  We spoke about it and I said, you have to write what you believe. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=51.0s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what to do. You have to write what you believe. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=56.0s)]
*  She's very beloved. People love our former first lady, I can tell you that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=59.0s)]
*  But I said you have to stick with your heart. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=65.0s)]
*  Now to be clear, this is part of an age-old pattern, a transparently craven and cynical attempt to appeal to women, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=68.0s)]
*  where Republican first ladies speak out in favor of abortion rights in stark contrast to their husbands' actual policies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=75.0s)]
*  Betty Ford pioneered this, doing it nearly 50 years ago. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=81.0s)]
*  I feel very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=86.0s)]
*  And in my words, bring it out of the backwoods and put it in the hospitals where it belonged. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=95.0s)]
*  I thought it was a great, great decision. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=101.0s)]
*  Jessica Valenti is the author of The Abortion Everyday Substack, where today she warns, don't fall for Melania's misdirection. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=104.0s)]
*  She is also the author of the brand new book, the essential book, Abortion, Our Body, Their Lies, and the Truce We Used to Win. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=112.0s)]
*  You can get that wherever you get your books, and I highly recommend it. She joins me now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=119.0s)]
*  Jessica, you had a sentence, I think, in your piece today that was, to me, summed it up, which was, I think you wrote, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=122.0s)]
*  how stupid do they think we are? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=127.0s)]
*  I mean, apparently pretty stupid. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=131.0s)]
*  It's really, I mean, maybe she is pro-choice, who knows, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=134.0s)]
*  But it's sort of irrelevant. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=138.0s)]
*  The fact that she is coming out with this a few weeks before the election in a time when her husband is trailing with women, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=139.0s)]
*  I think at last count was 21 points in a moment when women dying from abortion bans is all over the news. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=146.0s)]
*  I don't think that that is a coincidence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=154.0s)]
*  It is pretty craven and pretty disgusting to see actually as someone who writes about this all the time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah, you wrote, Melania has always been complicit in her husband's reign of terror and bigotry, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=164.0s)]
*  and now in the moment of unthinkable suffering, she is hawking a $40 book on the backs of dead women. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=168.0s)]
*  The one thing I will say about this, and this was evident in JD Vance's debate performance earlier in the week, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=174.0s)]
*  is like they do at least understand they're on the wrong side of this and are trying every trick in the book. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=180.0s)]
*  Denial, lies, evasion to get away from. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=190.0s)]
*  It's all distraction, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=195.0s)]
*  We had Trump saying that he was going to cover IVF. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=197.0s)]
*  Now he's saying that he would veto a national abortion ban, which we know is not true. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=200.0s)]
*  And we know that they're using, you know, funny games around language there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=204.0s)]
*  And having the first lady come out not just with this statement, but with that video in an ad that really looks like sort of like a bad 90s perfume commercial, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=208.0s)]
*  that's all anyone is talking about when it comes to abortion rights news. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXcn-Rq1lis&t=219.0s)]
