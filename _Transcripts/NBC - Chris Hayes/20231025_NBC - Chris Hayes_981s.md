# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 24
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI)
*  Nancy Pelosi has represented San Francisco for more than 35 years. She is of course [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=0.0s)]
*  former Democratic Speaker of the House, led the House Democratic caucus for 20 years, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=3.92s)]
*  and Speaker Emerita Pelosi joins me now. It's great to have you here. I guess my first question [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=7.44s)]
*  to you is someone who has started in politics from the time you were a child with your father as the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=14.08s)]
*  the Mayor of Baltimore and no politics very well. Are you surprised it has gotten this bad over there [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=19.84s)]
*  and it's gone this long? Well first may I thank you for the opportunity to spend some time with you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=27.84s)]
*  What I learned in Baltimore from my father was how to count votes. That's always really important [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=36.4s)]
*  and that seems to be something that is lacking on the other side of the aisle. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Am I surprised? I'm rarely surprised in politics but I do think that it is surprising that the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=47.6s)]
*  Republicans do not honor the oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=55.2s)]
*  States, to honor the institution in which we serve, and to respect the obligation that we have to the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=61.28s)]
*  American people to get the job done for them. And so whatever differences we may have, and we all [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=69.04s)]
*  have our differences in politics within our party, vis-a-vis the other party and the rest, at some [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=76.16s)]
*  point you have to come to a decision as to how you're going to get the job done. You weigh the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=82.56s)]
*  equities. I care about this, I care about that, but do I care about the American people the most? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=88.64s)]
*  Do I care about my oath of office? Do I respect the institution in which I serve? That should outweigh [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=95.28s)]
*  any of the other differences that we all have within our parties or within the Congress. I want [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  to follow up on that, a little bit of shop talk from someone who is I think by widely seen across [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=108.88s)]
*  the ideological spectrum by observers as one of the most effective legislative leaders of our time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=114.0s)]
*  You heard Saul Hill maybe talking about the sort of resentments that have built up, right? People [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=122.08s)]
*  are mad, these sort of after each round there's some new faction. How do you go about on the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=126.72s)]
*  democratic side where there is I think more of a sheer governing vision, like stitching those [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=133.76s)]
*  factions together? What is your approach? What would be an approach of a leader who rises to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=138.56s)]
*  the occasion to try to like get people over that sense of feeling angry or hurt or snubbed? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=143.84s)]
*  I would say one word which would define it all, respect. Respect which leads you to build consensus [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=152.0s)]
*  to come to a place where people weigh the equities and as I said before, come to a conclusion that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=159.28s)]
*  for this vote at this time, this is the right thing for our country. I also accept any compliment [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=166.24s)]
*  on behalf of my House Democrats by the courage to make some of the difficult decisions that are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  needed to come to consensus on a particular vote and live to have another debate another day, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=179.28s)]
*  but not try to win every fight every day. Pick your fights carefully, respect your caucus and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=186.88s)]
*  build consensus. By the way, I was down to two votes. I was down to two. I was down to two. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=195.76s)]
*  Yes and it was and we never saw anything like this as many people have remarked upon. One of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=204.0s)]
*  the things that happened today which seems to me a really, I mean part of this frankly I find sort [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  of entertaining because it's just it's sort of funny to watch, but something that's sort of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=214.16s)]
*  darker to me is the fact that Tom Emmer's vote to certify the election and any vote to certify [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=219.44s)]
*  the election to uphold as Jimmy Raskin often puts it, the Constitutional Republic is clearly a red [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=225.6s)]
*  line for Donald Trump personally and the MAGA faction. I wonder what you think the implications [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=231.04s)]
*  are for the country and for the House if that is the case, if that is a disqualifying vote. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=236.0s)]
*  Well let's just look at today. Today you had the former president of the United States [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=242.0s)]
*  in court, his chief chief as he called himself in his book, Meadows, Mark Meadows, saying that he [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=248.56s)]
*  told the president that he was wrong about the election, at least that's what's represented in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=256.4s)]
*  the press. The president's in court, the president's chief is getting immunity for what he has to say [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  about what the president knew about the election and you have the Republicans in Congress listening [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=270.72s)]
*  to a president in court whose own chief of staff is saying he was wrong and they're using that as [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=277.36s)]
*  the basis on how they go forward. What I gained from that, what I learned from that is to the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=286.16s)]
*  Republicans in America take back your party, the grand old party, a great party that made such a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  contribution to our country with great leadership in so many ways. Again who am I to be advocating [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=298.32s)]
*  for a strong Republican party but it's what our country needs in addition to a strong Democratic [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=306.4s)]
*  party, whatever other party that people put out there, but not to have a cult to really effectively [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  a thug as the represent manifestation of the Republican party now. The same day he's in court [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=319.2s)]
*  his chief of staff asks for immunity and they're following the lead of the person [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  whom his chief of staff is asking for immunity to tell the truth about. Something's wrong with this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  picture and I just think that if we can just get over this and the Republicans can be their true [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=340.8s)]
*  self, their conservative self, not fringe element off the spectrum of where you are in terms of the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  role of government. They don't believe in governance, understand that. So this for them is not any [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=354.8s)]
*  break in the action. They don't want any action. This is it. This is like glory hallelujah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=362.64s)]
*  They don't seem in a rush. They don't seem particularly, I mean they're mad at each other. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=370.08s)]
*  I want to ask about one of the things, one of the pressing reasons there's a government shutdown [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=373.76s)]
*  that will happen and obviously as the president announced in that primetime speech, aid, right, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=377.92s)]
*  an aid package to Ukraine and to Israel. Those are the pressing concerns for a policy agenda. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=383.12s)]
*  I want to ask about the Israel portion of that because we've talked about some of the internal [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=390.08s)]
*  factions in the Republican Party and in the Democratic Party I think there's widespread [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=394.56s)]
*  consensus and support for that aid package but there are about two dozen members who are now [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=398.8s)]
*  calling for a ceasefire and sponsoring a resolution concerned about escalation and what it would mean [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=402.64s)]
*  both at a humanitarian and strategic level. I wonder if you are having intra caucus conversations [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  about those concerns, if you share those concerns and where you think the party goes next on this, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=413.12s)]
*  the next step in this very, very difficult situation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=418.0s)]
*  Well first let me just say that our priority right now is to get the hostages freed. I thought that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=422.4s)]
*  what Secretary Blinken said today at the United Nations calling for humanitarian pause in the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=428.72s)]
*  military actions so that we can try to find a more peaceful path and especially right away to get [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=436.96s)]
*  more hostages freed. Not just American, although that's our responsibility, but all the hostages [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=445.36s)]
*  freed. The ceasefire, I think the humanitarian pause is the appropriate way to go. Look, what Hamas did [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=452.16s)]
*  was barbaric in Israel. It was barbaric. It was outside the circle of civilized human behavior [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=463.12s)]
*  and if it happened to your family you would want justice. I'm not talking about revenge, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  I want just, I'm saying justice. So there has to be some other place we go instead of just saying [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=475.92s)]
*  let's have a ceasefire. I mean we had a ceasefire in Ney that was broken by Hamas on October 7th [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  so let's remember that. But there may be some a few votes in our caucus who may not support the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=491.12s)]
*  package but I think by and large it will be overwhelmingly supported. We just have to get a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  speaker on the Republican side. They won, they've got the confidence of the American people. Now [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  they should show they're worthy of that confidence by at least electing a leader, a speaker, so that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=512.72s)]
*  we can conduct the business of Congress and that includes coming forth with this package and then [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=518.64s)]
*  keeping government open after that. But to your point I think there may be a few votes from [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  against and some of those votes have been vocal but overwhelmingly there will be support for it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=532.4s)]
*  Well yes, you're right that the order of operations here requires a speaker of the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  house before any of that can happen, at least as the rules are currently constituted though [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=543.12s)]
*  who knows what tomorrow will bring. Congresswoman and Speaker of America Nancy Pelosi, always a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=546.4s)]
*  pleasure to have you on. Thank you ma'am. My pleasure. Yet another day with a double dose [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=550.48s)]
*  of bad news for Donald Trump when news broke today that two members of his inner coup circle [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  are reportedly talking with prosecutors including his former chief of staff. The day began with one [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=560.0s)]
*  of his former lawyers and co-defendants pleading guilty in the Georgia Rico case. You may recognize [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=564.88s)]
*  her sitting right there and it ended with ABC News reporting that his former chief of staff Mark [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=570.16s)]
*  Meadows there on the left has been talking with special counsel Jack Smith and his team in exchange [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=574.56s)]
*  for immunity. According to ABC News citing sources familiar with the matter, Mark Meadows has spoken [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  with special counsel Jack Smith's team at least three times this year including once before a [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=584.64s)]
*  federal grand jury which came only after Smith granted Meadows immunity to testify under oath. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, NBC News has not independently verified the reporting and Meadows lawyer told NBC News in part, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=595.5999999999999s)]
*  I told ABC their story was largely inaccurate. We didn't specify what was inaccurate so we're [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=602.0s)]
*  just trying to sort that out. Now the Meadows news broke just hours after another one of Trump's [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=607.76s)]
*  former attorneys, Jenna Ellis, pleaded guilty in Trump's Rico case. In the weeks after the 2020 [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=613.12s)]
*  election you may remember Ellis seen there over Rudy's shoulder traveled extensively with Rudy [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=619.44s)]
*  Giuliani, kind of his number two lieutenant, pushing the big lie in several states including [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  Georgia. She is now the fourth person and the third attorney to plead guilty in that Georgia [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=629.04s)]
*  Rico case and the first to read out a statement in court. As an attorney who is also a Christian, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=635.36s)]
*  I take my responsibilities as a lawyer very seriously and I endeavor to be a person of sound [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=642.64s)]
*  moral and ethical character in all of my dealings. In the wake of the 2020 presidential election [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=648.4s)]
*  I believed that challenging the results on behalf of President Trump should be pursued in a just [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=655.52s)]
*  and legal way. If I knew then what I know now I would have declined to represent Donald Trump [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=660.4s)]
*  in these post-election challenges. I look back on this whole experience with deep remorse. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  Timmy Dio, Ganga Williams, a former federal prosecutor who served as a senior investigative [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=671.04s)]
*  counsels of the January 6th committee and he joins me now. I just got to start by noting you [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=675.04s)]
*  got a day where you've got the third Trump lawyer pleading guilty on the same day that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=680.0s)]
*  one of his ex-lawyers Michael Cohen sitting testifying against him in a civil fraud case [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=685.44s)]
*  after having pleaded guilty as well. Like the unbelievable and I would dare say unprecedented [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=689.44s)]
*  run of lawyers for this guy ending up with criminal pleas. I don't think that I don't think that I [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=694.96s)]
*  think this is a record-setting run that Donald Trump's lawyers are on. Probably so but you know [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=700.48s)]
*  if there's one thing lawyers are is risk-averse. That's why it's so rare. That's my point. Yeah but [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the lawyers are also going to be well equipped to see the danger they're facing with [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=711.44s)]
*  criminal exposure. In terms of pleas. In terms of pleas. I mean I think lawyers are going to be [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=716.0s)]
*  likely the first ones if you have them among a set of defendants who can see down the road they can [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=720.96s)]
*  see mandatory minimums and they are going to be the ones who are likely to want to be out there [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=725.2s)]
*  first and get the best deal possible which I think is what's happening here. Okay let's talk [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=729.44s)]
*  about Jenna Ellis right. So we one of the things noted here is that Chesbrough and Sidney Powell [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=733.28s)]
*  who pleaded last week. It's unclear one of the issues flagged by by Andrew Weissman and Christy [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=739.92s)]
*  Bringerberg when they were on this program last week was it's unclear how full that cooperation [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=746.16s)]
*  is right. Powell seems to have something more like a traditional cooperation agreement basically with [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=750.56s)]
*  the prosecutors and I want to play what Rudy Giuliani said back in August at the suggestion [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=757.28s)]
*  that his number two his former lieutenant Jenna Ellis might flip. He did not like the idea take a [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=762.08s)]
*  listen. I hope that's not the case because I know she was sort of like she was my number two right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=766.08s)]
*  She was excellent and she was firmly convinced that the election was she was firmly convinced [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=773.12s)]
*  the election was over and she's the one who recommended Professor Eastwood was more [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=779.84s)]
*  zealous about the fact that this was a stolen election than Jenna Ellis and I think anybody [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=784.24s)]
*  on that team would testify to that. So I would find it very very hard to believe that she did that [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=790.08s)]
*  but she could have gotten intimidated. That's them waiting for the espressos and sambucas apparently. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know what that setting is but he doesn't want her to flip and it seems to me like when [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=800.88s)]
*  you're talking Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis flipping now really squarely puts Rudy Giuliani in a vice. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=806.08s)]
*  Certainly does but remember we're also talking about a RICO case so anytime you're getting [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=811.36s)]
*  evidence against one's defendant that's going to go against all of them. So yes you are building [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=815.76s)]
*  a case against Rudy but that case against Rudy will also be a case against Trump. So it's not [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=820.56s)]
*  just bad for one person it's bad for everyone that's left over. It's interesting you say that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=824.96s)]
*  because I remember when this when the case was brought it was the last of these criminal cases [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=828.8s)]
*  to be brought. There was a lot we spent a lot of time on Georgia's RICO law which is stronger than [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=832.48s)]
*  the federal law. There's a lot of question about can this Fulton County office manage this complex [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=837.36s)]
*  prosecution? Willis is having a pretty good run so far it seems like. Am I wrong? You're not wrong. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=841.84s)]
*  I mean I will note she has at least from what we can see given pretty generous plea deals. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=848.1600000000001s)]
*  Time will tell whether those are good deals. You federal prosecutors all sound the same. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=853.76s)]
*  We're saying the exact same thing. Yeah and I think time will tell but she's clearly focused [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=858.96s)]
*  on getting people out of this case which is what people thought she would do. She's narrowing down [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=863.52s)]
*  defendants quite quickly. It seems to the public this is perhaps moving slowly from a prosecutor's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=867.28s)]
*  perspective this is lightning speed. I can't get over how fast it's moving and speaking of cooperation [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=873.36s)]
*  let's talk about Mark Meadows. I don't we don't know we have the ABC report. I guess my question [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=878.8s)]
*  to you is are there is it seems to me there's a spectrum between cooperating and testifying under [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=885.28s)]
*  immunity before say a grand jury or talking to federal prosecutors under immunity. Is there a [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=892.4s)]
*  distinction between those two things? 100% and I think we've seen a lot of conflating of those and [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=896.64s)]
*  they have to be parsed out. Cooperation that is when you are basically facing criminal exposure [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=900.72s)]
*  you want to get leniency and then you basically lay down your sword. You sing for yourself. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=906.64s)]
*  Exactly. It's like tell me everything you know and then maybe maybe we'll go easy on you. Exactly. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  You know when I was a prosecutor what that looks like is that you come and you say everything you've [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  done from the crimes that you could be charged with to every piece of candy ever stolen. That's [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=922.08s)]
*  cooperation. Now you can have immunity which can be more specific. So for example this the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  reporting says he testified in front of a grand jury. He could be immunized for that purpose. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=933.0400000000001s)]
*  It does not mean he's so-called flipped the way some people have noted. It could mean that he's [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=938.0s)]
*  like Mark Meadows has been known to do going up to the line doing it enough to avoid perhaps getting [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=943.2800000000001s)]
*  further trouble but then pulling back. Yes that's the famous Meadows two-step. It does look like [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=948.24s)]
*  Ellis is more in that cooperator category and I think Powell and Chesbro it sort of remains to be [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=952.16s)]
*  seen but that's a very useful sort of spectrum to think about. Timmy Dyle, Ganga Williams, thank you. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=956.4s)]
*  you [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_5pw50efI&t=978.24s)]
