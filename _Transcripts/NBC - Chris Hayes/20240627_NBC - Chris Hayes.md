# See Chris Hayes demolish Trump's '4 years ago' question with facts
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk)
*  On my show, we've been trying to help answer that one question that does come up basically every presidential campaign. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=0.0s)]
*  Remember Ronald Reagan talking about Jimmy Carter? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=8.4s)]
*  Ronald Reagan used to ask, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=10.8s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=12.1s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=14.0s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=14.9s)]
*  Are we better off? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=16.8s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=18.8s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=19.7s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=20.3s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=20.8s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=21.3s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=21.7s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=22.3s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=22.8s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Better off. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=24.0s)]
*  Than you were four years ago? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=24.6s)]
*  Now it does come up every time, but as I've said, if you were the Trump campaign, maybe you don't want to ask it this time around, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=27.2s)]
*  We were all there because four years ago was June 2020, and this is what it looked like. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=34.5s)]
*  Tonight, we have passed yet another milestone in this country, as today, the number of coronavirus cases topped two and a half million. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=42.9s)]
*  That includes more than 125,000 deaths. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=51.4s)]
*  And tonight, much of the focus is on the southern and southwestern states where cases are mounting. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=54.9s)]
*  We did so well before the plague, and we're doing so well after the plague. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=60.4s)]
*  Now, this video obtained by The Washington Post raising questions. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=65.2s)]
*  The Trump campaign asked why workers were appearing to remove stickers promoting social distancing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=68.9s)]
*  This one reading, Do not sit here, please. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=74.9s)]
*  ABC News confirming the Post report that the campaign directed those stickers to be taken down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=77.5s)]
*  A campaign official says the rally was in full compliance with local requirements. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  Those attending entering the arena at their own risk, signing a waiver agreeing not to sue the campaign if they get sick. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  It was four years ago today that story broke. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=96.3s)]
*  The Trump campaign took those stickers off the seats, and it was significant because remember that was Trump's infamous rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  exactly one week earlier, the big back to the campaign, the one that everyone told him not to do because it would be a massive disaster. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=108.0s)]
*  For months now, large gatherings have been canceled. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  No concerts, no stadiums filled for sporting events. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=120.5s)]
*  But tonight in Tulsa, Oklahoma, an arena is packed with thousands rallying for President Trump's reelection. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  The president left Washington late today for a destination he has not seen in 110 days. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=130.0s)]
*  The campaign trail. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=136.2s)]
*  The event in Oklahoma is unbelievable. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  The crowds are unbelievable. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=140.2s)]
*  My preference would be that that it be postponed until it's safe to actually have an event where people can come together and be a part of the political process. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Today, we learned six members of the president's advanced team tested positive for coronavirus. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=151.0s)]
*  They will be given a mask. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=156.5s)]
*  It's up to them whether to make that decision. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=157.6s)]
*  CDC guidelines are recommended, but not required. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  When you come to the rally, as if any event, you assume a personal risk. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=161.8s)]
*  That is just what you do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=166.4s)]
*  Of course, we now know Trump supporters were intentionally misled about that risk. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  One of those supporters was Herman Cain, former Godfather's Pizza CEO, former Republican presidential candidate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  That's him at the rally there on the left without a mask, not social distancing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  Everyone's packed together. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=182.5s)]
*  A week later, Herman Cain was in the hospital with COVID. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=184.5s)]
*  He was there for a month and he died on July 30th. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=187.4s)]
*  Years later, Trump aide Cassidy Hutchison wrote in her book that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told her, quote, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=191.6s)]
*  We killed Herman Cain. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=197.2s)]
*  Trump's tragic and catastrophic handling of that once in a century pandemic, the plague, was the defining characteristic of four years ago, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=199.7s)]
*  although I think we've all kind of blocked it out a little bit. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=208.0s)]
*  But also, four years ago today, the stock market was at 25,000. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  Today, it's at nearly 40,000. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=213.7s)]
*  Four years ago, the unemployment rate was at 11 percent. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=215.1s)]
*  It's 4 percent today. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  Four years ago was the summer of widespread unrest and then vigilante violence when Kyle Rittenhouse killed two protesters, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=220.0s)]
*  when the sitting president used tear gas on civil rights demonstrators to clear the streets for that Bible photo op, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=227.5s)]
*  when he floated delaying the election because he was losing in the polls, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=233.7s)]
*  when he sprung Roger Stone from prison so he could help with the efforts to steal said election. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=237.1s)]
*  The country was in crisis every minute, palpable life altering crisis day after day on multiple fronts. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=243.1s)]
*  Our nervous systems were being constantly overwhelmed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=249.9s)]
*  So, yeah, ask yourself, take a second and remember, are you better off today than during the summer of chaos and despair four years ago? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=252.3s)]
*  Wow, I think the answer is pretty clear, Rachel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuC4laToROk&t=262.3s)]
