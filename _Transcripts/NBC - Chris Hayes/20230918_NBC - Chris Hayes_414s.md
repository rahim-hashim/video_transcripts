# Fetterman to House Republicans: Bring the vote or find a new leg to hump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM)
*  And Senator John Fetterman, Democrat of Pennsylvania, joins me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, it's good to see you. I haven't gotten a chance to talk to you in a while. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Great to be here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=8.08s)]
*  Let me start with the most important matter facing our country at this dire moment, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=12.0s)]
*  which is the matter of the Senate dress code, which has recently been changed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=16.32s)]
*  Of course. Yes. Yeah, no, of course. I've heard that some people are upset about that, and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=21.28s)]
*  the right have been losing their mind. They're just like, oh my God, dogs and cats are living [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=28.16s)]
*  together. And like I said, aren't there more important things we should be talking about [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  rather than if I dress like a slob? Yes. Marjorie Taylor Greene said that Senate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=37.2s)]
*  no longer enforcing a dress code for senators is to appease Fetterman is disgraceful. Dress code [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  is one of society's standards that said etiquette and respect for institutions stop lowering the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=49.2s)]
*  bar. What do you say to that? Well, her platform, really, she runs on more and more dingling picks [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=54.16s)]
*  the meetings over in Congress. So again, I'm not really sure why she cares how I dress, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  but she really takes it a different way. Let's talk about some of the big stuff going on in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=73.44s)]
*  that House caucus. You in the Senate, basically my understanding of how things have operated since [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=79.84s)]
*  that deal was a bipartisan deal was struck for certain top line spending numbers for all of the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=85.44s)]
*  funding bills that have to be passed to make the budget keep the government running. The Senate [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=91.84s)]
*  has basically been delivering those and passing them by big 91 7 bipartisan majorities. The House [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  today looks like it's falling apart. You've already got 17 no votes in that House Republican [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=102.64s)]
*  caucus saying we're not passing anything. What do you think is happening here? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=108.08s)]
*  Truly, I was very proud of my colleagues because they're really about governance. That's what it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=113.28s)]
*  is. And on the other, the House, the whatever they call themselves, Team America or whatever [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=118.0s)]
*  they call themselves, I just like, bring your vote. Otherwise, they need to go hump a different leg. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=123.44s)]
*  I think it was a Ford from Braddock, Pennsylvania, where you live, out to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=129.68s)]
*  Michigan for a rally with the striking United Auto Workers. I want to play you what President [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=139.52s)]
*  Biden had to say about the strike and then get your thoughts on the strike. This is what President [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=147.36s)]
*  Biden had to say. The companies have made some significant offers, but I believe they should go [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=152.24s)]
*  further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the U.S. W. Let's say that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=158.96s)]
*  again. Record corporate profits, which they have, should be shared by record contracts for the U.A. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=164.4s)]
*  And just as we're building an economy in the future, we need labor agreements for the future. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=171.68s)]
*  What do you think about the president's message to strikers? And what were you telling them? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=177.28s)]
*  They're out on the line. Now, again, I do know that Joe Biden is really a strong, incredible [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=180.4s)]
*  pro-labor president. That's a fact. And I know he's going to be involved in the way he should be, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=187.36s)]
*  and we're going to work towards a better ending for the workers. I was proud to drive there, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=192.96s)]
*  as well. I literally drove in my Bronco. The Bronco wanted to meet its makers and where it was born. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=198.96s)]
*  And that's where I greeted the workers that literally built my car. And I'm proud to stand [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=204.4s)]
*  with them. And it's really cynical the way now that Trump is now visiting there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=210.8s)]
*  But again, we've already been there, been there, done that. And it's, they say, imitation and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  flattery. Yeah, let's talk about that. The ex-president is going to give some speech in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=222.88s)]
*  Detroit to autoworkers, which was announced recently instead of his appearance in the second [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  debate. And obviously, I think you know this well. I mean, you won an estate with a lot of the kinds [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=235.12s)]
*  of voters that were maybe Obama, Trump, Federman voters, right? Those provided probably a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  margin for your victory. The ex-president trying to make a play for them. What is your message to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=245.68s)]
*  those folks about who is going to look out for the interests of people like autoworkers in the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  White House between possibly Donald Trump or Joe Biden? Well, of course, he's only going there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  and he's cynical and he thinks he can appeal to the voters in Michigan. But he also doesn't have [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=261.6s)]
*  a lot of competition either. You know, DeSantis, you know, you know, he doesn't, you know, he, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=266.64s)]
*  you know, I dress the way he campaigns, you know, so he's able to just, you know, skip, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=274.0s)]
*  you know, debates because the others, they just don't have competition. But, you know, I really [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=280.4s)]
*  don't believe there's no chance that Trump to win in Michigan. He sure isn't going to win in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=285.04s)]
*  Pennsylvania, but it's just a it's a cheesy, cynical play. You and I have not spoken, I think, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=291.12s)]
*  for a while you were campaigning. Obviously, you had a stroke and had to deal with the aftermath [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=297.84s)]
*  of that and campaign while recovering from a stroke. You were then in inpatient treatment [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=303.92s)]
*  for depression and Walter Reed. And I've read some of the things you said and listened to some [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  of the interviews, which I found incredibly moving and powerful. And I was I was really [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=312.32s)]
*  blown away by your sort of honesty about that. And I just since we haven't spoken in a while, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=317.44s)]
*  given the fact that you, you know, you're still dealing with all this stuff while you're being a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  U.S. senator commuting to see your family. How are you doing? Yeah, no, I dearly miss my family as [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  well. You know, people really need to understand that being a senator or being a congresswoman or [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=333.36s)]
*  man, you know, you have to realize it's like kind of like you're almost like a divorce, you know, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=338.24s)]
*  seeing the love people that you love 50 percent less than you would have beforehand. That is well, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=342.48s)]
*  too. And, you know, you know, my fight, you know, depression has always been a bipartisan kind of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=346.8s)]
*  struggle. And that's been my message throughout all this as well, too. And I just hope anybody [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=352.64s)]
*  that would reach my message to understand that that treatment works and get help and don't ever, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=357.12s)]
*  ever, ever consider harming yourself. You know, and I think that there's millions of Americans all [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=364.8s)]
*  across this country that suffer from it. And I run into people regularly, you know, daily that, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=370.16s)]
*  you know, thank me for talking about it. And, you know, I have a duty and a privilege to be talking [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=375.12s)]
*  about that to people. And I'm always delighted to do that because it is such an important message. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=380.96s)]
*  And I was grateful and lucky to get the kind of treatment that pulled me out of the darkness. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=386.32s)]
*  And I just would hope that for anybody that's facing that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CDd0XvQnM&t=391.44s)]
