# ‘Way wrong’ Chris Hayes debunks the myth of ‘organized’ shoplifting
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU)
*  Since President Biden took office nearly three years ago, we've been inundated with a seemingly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=0.0s)]
*  never-ending series of moral panics in the media. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  It should come as no surprise that this trend was particularly pronounced in right-wing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=7.4s)]
*  media, like with the so-called shoplifting epidemic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, no one denies shoplifting exists. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Of course, it happens. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  But perhaps the reality doesn't merit the breathless coverage it receives on Fox News. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=17.8s)]
*  In fact, as The New York Times reported last month, quote, the various sources of crime [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  data from government agencies and private groups tell a consistent story. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=27.96s)]
*  Retail theft has not spiked nationwide in the past several years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=31.76s)]
*  If anything, it appears less common in most of the country than it was before the pandemic. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=36.16s)]
*  Less common. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  You hear that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=41.96s)]
*  Now, among the loudest voices in this propaganda campaign were the retail companies themselves, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  who took every opportunity to complain about the so-called shoplifting epidemic. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=47.96s)]
*  If you look a little deeper, though, you'll find multiple occasions retailers have cited [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  shoplifting as a major reason for declining profits, only for the reality to be more complicated. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Like, for instance, when Target announced it was closing a flagship location in Manhattan [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  due to shoplifting. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=68.16s)]
*  Only for the building's landlord to reveal the company was actually moving to a smaller [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=69.76s)]
*  location nearby, adding, quote, the retailer didn't raise theft as an issue, leading up [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=73.76s)]
*  to the announcement. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=78.36s)]
*  Sometimes the concession comes from the company itself, like when the CFO of Walgreens told [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=79.76s)]
*  investors earlier this year, and I quote him here, maybe we cried too much about shoplifting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=84.66s)]
*  in 2022. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=90.66s)]
*  The silver bullet argument for proponents of the shoplifting epidemic was an analysis [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=92.66s)]
*  from the National Retail Federation released earlier this year, which said that organized [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  theft accounted for nearly half of all retail losses in 2021. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=101.86s)]
*  So not just petty thieves, but there was this new epidemic of organized crime ring storming [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=105.66s)]
*  stores and taking everything. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=110.86s)]
*  That report was widely cited in the media, and fear mongering about organized retail [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=113.26s)]
*  crime was everywhere. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=117.86s)]
*  But the facts in that study were way wrong, and it's important to unpack just what happened. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=119.76s)]
*  As I mentioned earlier, the National Retail Federation released a report saying that organized [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=125.06s)]
*  theft accounted for nearly half of all retail losses. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=130.06s)]
*  Now, they got that stat from the Senate testimony of an anti-shoplifting expert in 2021. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=133.26s)]
*  I want to share firsthand today what I've experienced over 30 years of working on this problem. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=141.26s)]
*  Organized retail crime represents a massive and growing threat to the tune of $45 billion a year. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=147.26s)]
*  Well, he seems credible. He's up there. He's got the microphone. He's a witness. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=153.26s)]
*  You know, he's sworn in. Except it seems the facts may have been flubbed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=157.26s)]
*  As the New York Times now reports, quote, that man was citing a, get this, 2016 survey, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=161.26s)]
*  which was actually referring to the overall cost of shrink in 2015, not the amount lost to just [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=168.26s)]
*  organized regional crime. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=174.26s)]
*  That's a huge distinction. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=176.26s)]
*  The source for the widely shared claim that there was this new trend, this new phenomenon, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=178.26s)]
*  organized retail theft that accounted for half of all retail losses in 2021 coming out of the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=184.26s)]
*  pandemic, Joe Biden's chaotic America, was actually a statistic about all retail inventory loss, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=190.26s)]
*  everything from lost merchandise to damaged product from six years earlier. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=196.26s)]
*  They have nothing to do with each other. The claim has been totally debunked. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=201.26s)]
*  In fact, get this, the National Retail Federation was forced to retract it, but not before. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=205.26s)]
*  We are learning tonight that organized crime is behind the $70 billion retail theft crisis in this country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=218.26s)]
*  Perfect example why you should be skeptical the way some bad faith actors try to frame news about [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=225.26s)]
*  particularly the economy and crime. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=231.26s)]
*  I have much more to say, some of the same characters are trying to undermine some good news for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=234.26s)]
*  Bidenomics next. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=238.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ZMP-8p8NU&t=255.26s)]
