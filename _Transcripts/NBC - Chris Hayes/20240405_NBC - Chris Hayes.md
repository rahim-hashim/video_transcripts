# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights April 4
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump lost again in court today. But, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=0.0s)]
*  but, but, his handpicked judge still left the door open for him to skirt accountability [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=4.32s)]
*  for his crimes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=9.88s)]
*  In a brief three-page ruling issued this afternoon, Judge Aline Cannon denied the ex-president's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=11.44s)]
*  motion to have his classified documents case completely dismissed, thrown out under the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=16.64s)]
*  Presidential Records Act. Trump's lawyers effectively argued he had a right to steal [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  the documents containing some of our nation's most highly guarded secrets because he was [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=26.12s)]
*  the president when he obtained them and he could secretly declare them his personal papers [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=30.44s)]
*  if he's so inclined and not tell anyone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=35.28s)]
*  Cannon rejected that argument, so that's good, because it's an absurd argument. But she ruled [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=38.36s)]
*  in this really insidious way that still gives Trump an out, so to speak, because in that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=43.64s)]
*  same order she also rejected a demand from Special Counsel Jack Smatt to address the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=49.72s)]
*  underlying question at hand. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  Can Trump's lawyers make that same ridiculous case about the Presidential Records Act to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=58.44s)]
*  the jurors? Can they make the case that the classified documents' secrets that he hoarded [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  in his bathroom were actually his property to do with as he wishes? Did he get a right [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=68.52s)]
*  to decide which top secret documents are his personal property and that such decisions [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  cannot be subject to any scrutiny at all? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=77.64s)]
*  Again, to be clear, it's a nonsensical argument. It's the literal opposite of the Presidential [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=79.88s)]
*  Records Act's intent and effect. It's not serious. But Judge Cannon continues to act [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=85.44s)]
*  not like a serious jurist. Instead, she is once again bending over backwards to kind [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  of grant legitimacy through omission to Trump's twisted and laughable interpretation of law. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=98.72s)]
*  So last month she asked both Smith and Trump's lawyers to draft instructions for a potential [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=105.52s)]
*  jury in this trial based, again, on that fantastical legal argument. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=111.92s)]
*  Quote, a president and his sole authority on the Presidential Records Act to categorize [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=116.48s)]
*  records as personal or presidential during his or her presidency, neither a court nor [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=120.64s)]
*  a jury is permitted to make or review such a categorization decision. Although there [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=125.68s)]
*  is no formal means in the PRA by which a president is to make that categorization, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=130.0s)]
*  an outgoing president's decision to exclude what he or she considers to be personal records [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=135.52s)]
*  from presidential records transmitted to the National Archives and Records Administration [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=140.56s)]
*  constitutes a president's categorization of those records as personal under the PRA. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=145.36s)]
*  Again, what this would mean, the argument would be, despite there's a fact of Presidential [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=150.24s)]
*  Records Act that requires, that states that everything that the government has belongs [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=155.28s)]
*  to the people, that instead, depending on what the president wanted to take or not take, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=162.24s)]
*  it, that would make whatever is his personal. It's a perversion of what the Presidential [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=169.68s)]
*  Records Act set out to do. Understandably, Jack Smith was not pleased about that order [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=175.92s)]
*  from Judge Cannon, which would only serve to confuse and mislead the jury about their [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=180.4s)]
*  role in this case. He called correctly the entire argument, quote, unstated and fundamentally [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  flawed, adding, quote, that legal premise is wrong and a jury instruction that reflects [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  that premise would distort the trial. He then requested that Judge Cannon rule one way or [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=195.36s)]
*  another on whether she thinks, again, this is a serious legal argument. Quote, it is vitally [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  important the court promptly decide whether the unstated legal premise underlying the recent [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  order does in the court's view represent a correct formulation of the law. But here's where we come [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  to the rub because today Judge Cannon point and lead decline to make such a determination. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  She effectively thumbed her nose at Smith's request for a prompt decision, writing, quote, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=224.4s)]
*  to the extent the special counsel demands an anticipatory finalization of jury instructions [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=228.72s)]
*  prior to trial, prior to a charge conference, prior to the presentation of trial defenses and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=233.76s)]
*  evidence, the court declines that demand as unprecedented and unjust. In other words, no, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to make a decision anytime soon, counselor. In fact, Judge Cannon argues, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=245.04s)]
*  she might not make a decision until after a jury's been sworn in. And that is the key to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=251.04s)]
*  letting the guy who appointed her to the bench off the hook. Because if Judge Cannon decides to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=256.88s)]
*  let this ridiculous argument go forward, the president has the power to do every wants jury. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  Those are your instructions. At that point, it's too late for Jack Smith to do anything about it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  because the Fifth Amendment says you cannot be prosecuted twice for the same crime. And once [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  those double jeopardy protections kick in, there's no turning back. Once there's a jury there, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=277.84s)]
*  which means if Trump is acquitted because the jury was told a lie about how the law works, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=282.56s)]
*  there's no way to bring charges against him. That possibility hangs like a potential nuclear [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=286.96s)]
*  bomb looming over all these proceedings can be dropped by Judge Cannon at any moment. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=294.64s)]
*  She's preserved the option of essentially allowing the ex-president to mount a defense that is based [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=299.76s)]
*  on a fundamentally obvious misstatement of the Black Letter law, a defense that everyone [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=304.8s)]
*  acknowledges would allow him to get off scot-free. She all but dared the special counsel's office to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=311.44s)]
*  appeal to a higher court. Quote, as always, any party remains free to avail itself of whatever [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=316.32s)]
*  appellate options it sees fit to invoke as permitted by law. At this point, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=321.44s)]
*  special counsel Jack Smith might be left with no choice. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=326.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's financial situation is not quite as desperate as it was just two weeks ago when he [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=329.6s)]
*  was scrounging around the couch cushions for half a billion dollars to cover the bond in his New [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=335.68s)]
*  York civil fraud case. But he's still squeezed and vulnerable and basically walking around with a big [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=340.56s)]
*  bribe me sign hanging around his neck. Remember, Trump wriggled out of that immediate peril in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  New York after an appellate court knocked down the bond amount by more than 60% and gave him a 10 [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  extra days to figure it out. Before that ruling, which came without any real rationale, to be [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=356.16s)]
*  honest, Trump was in danger of having his assets seized. If he did not post this bond, New York [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  Attorney General Letitia James could take possession of some of his multi-million dollar properties, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  which span several states. Just in the nick of time, though, Donald Trump found a billionaire [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=372.48s)]
*  benefactor to come to his rescue. This is Don Hanke, an 80-year-old California businessman [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=377.04s)]
*  worth more than seven billion dollars. Hanke owns an auto services empire that includes a real estate [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=383.2s)]
*  firm, an auto insurance company, and a rental car company. But his real claim to fame and fortune [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=388.32s)]
*  is as the king of subprime car loans. We had cases where people would come into our lot to buy a used [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=393.84s)]
*  car or a new car and they'd have poor credit but they had a good down payment. So we decided to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=401.36s)]
*  carry our own paper and so buy here, pay here is what it's called. So if somebody had three thousand [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=406.48s)]
*  dollars and we had a car that maybe we're in four thousand, we get three thousand dollars down from [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=412.32s)]
*  them, sell the car for six thousand, and then we would collect their receivable. Yeah, that's nice [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=417.36s)]
*  work if you can get it. To be clear, these kinds of loans are for people with low credit scores who [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=425.6s)]
*  desperately need a car for their lives to get to work. They don't have quite enough cash up front. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=429.52s)]
*  So what they do is they end up paying usurious interest rates, like you just heard, at very high [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=435.84s)]
*  fees. And perhaps not surprisingly, that turns out to be an incredibly profitable business. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=441.04s)]
*  It catapulted Don Hankey to number 128 on Forbes most recent list of the richest people in America, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=446.32s)]
*  a position he certainly seems to enjoy. You know, I think I can't live without a large boat. I had [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=452.56s)]
*  a boat. I can't live without big houses. What I really love to have is a nice view wherever I am, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=458.56s)]
*  I think, and technology. For the last few years I've been getting picked up in the morning and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  taken home in a Mercedes-Benz Maubach. Now, Hankey told The Washington Post that it was his wife [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=470.64s)]
*  Debbie's idea to use their fortune to help Donald Trump. They first reached out to Trump's team to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  negotiate a deal before a court reduced the bond, and Trump said he had the cash to post it himself. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=481.76s)]
*  Then, to his surprise, the Trump team last week revived the talks and asked Hankey if he would [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=487.2s)]
*  back the new amount. Hankey promptly agreed. He is in the subprime loan business after all, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=492.0s)]
*  saying that his company is charging Trump a, quote, modest fee, which he declined to disclose. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  Hankey says he's been a Trump supporter, quote, but wouldn't consider himself a major supporter. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  While he's never spoken directly to the former president, he did receive a call from Trump's son [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=508.32s)]
*  Eric thanking him for posting the bond. So, you don't know for sure why Don Hankey decided to do [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=511.84s)]
*  this. He's got a lot of money. He likes Donald Trump. Maybe that's enough of a reason. Hankey [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=517.12s)]
*  told The New York Times, quote, I looked at it as business, number one, and number two, I was happy [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  to help someone, which is sweet. What do you think would happen if Donald Trump gets back [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=525.52s)]
*  in the Oval Office where he would make appointments to the federal agencies that regulate subprime [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=530.64s)]
*  auto loans, or if legislation comes up that would seek to rein them in or regulate them? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=534.88s)]
*  Don Hankey just put up $175 million of Donald Trump. He saved Trump from the humiliation [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  of admitting he did not have the cash of having his property seized. What do you think would [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=545.92s)]
*  happen when Hankey needs a favor or a favorable policy from a Trump administration? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=550.8s)]
*  Again, this is just one example of the, let's say, shady interest capitalizing on Donald Trump's [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=555.68s)]
*  financial insecurity. Tomorrow, the LIV Golf Miami tournament begins at Trump's Doral Golf Course. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=561.76s)]
*  LIV is an upstart league sponsored by Saudi Arabia's Sovereign Wealth Fund, essentially a kind of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  influence operation controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. While Trump Organization [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=573.76s)]
*  Executives said the direct payments from LIV were relatively small, the tournament itself is, of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  course, a boon for the business. Occupancy is way up at the resort where the asking price for hotel [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k50sxcVYmc&t=584.96s)]
