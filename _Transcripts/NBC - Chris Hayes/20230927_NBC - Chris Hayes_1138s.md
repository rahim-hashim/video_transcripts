# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 26
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM)
*  Ruth Ben-Ghiatta is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=0.0s)]
*  author of the book Strong Men from Mussolini to the Present. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=4.24s)]
*  George Conway is a prominent conservative attorney and former Republican, and both join [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=7.08s)]
*  me now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=11.48s)]
*  George, you know, people can speculate about the state of mind in all this, but the pattern [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=12.48s)]
*  here is clear, and I thought, you know, what Cassidy Hutchinson relays in that book, where [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  she can't look into his mind either, but what she can say is he's watching them say, hang [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=22.28s)]
*  Mike Pence on TV, and then he tweets that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=27.56s)]
*  You can draw your own conclusions about the degree to which this figure views the threat [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=30.56s)]
*  of violence as an actual tool to explicitly wield on his behalf. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=35.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, and I think a lot of people don't take that seriously and don't quite [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=40.44s)]
*  understand it because it's foreign to them, but the two kinds of people, the two categories [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=46.56s)]
*  of people who best understood Donald Trump in 2015 and 2016 were students of psychology [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=51.48s)]
*  and psychiatry and then students of history like Ruth, and they both come at it from different [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=57.31999999999999s)]
*  directions, but they get to the same place. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=63.04s)]
*  From a psychological standpoint, the explanation for his behavior on January 6th is that he's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=65.96s)]
*  a narcissistic sociopath, a psychopath, a malignant narcissist. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=71.64s)]
*  He's all of those things, a megalomaniac, and all of those things intersect. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  He wants power. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=80.36s)]
*  He has no conscience. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=81.36s)]
*  He feels that he can do whatever he wants and that he's immune from rules, and that's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  exactly how he behaved on January 6th, and that's what you're seeing now in all of his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=87.8s)]
*  other threats to what he's going to do if he's elected president again. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=93.2s)]
*  And the historians look at that from, we've seen these people before in history, and here's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=97.64s)]
*  what they have done, and Ruth wrote an excellent book that I recommend to everyone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=103.8s)]
*  I've been recommending it for three years now, Strongman, that basically goes through [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=107.84s)]
*  what these people are all like from the historical standpoint and how they behave and how they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=112.4s)]
*  operate, and they operate just like Donald Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, and one of the things that is striking here at this just sort of day-to-day level, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Ruth, is, and Cassidy talks, Texey Hutchinson talks about this, New York Times talk about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=124.36s)]
*  it is, if you go after powerful people in a liberal and open society, there's all sorts [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=128.04s)]
*  of things that you might risk, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=134.2s)]
*  You might have career issues, there's reputational issues, maybe you'll get sued for defamation, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=135.8s)]
*  right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=140.8s)]
*  There's a bunch of things, but that's all within the boundaries of a liberal democracy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=141.8s)]
*  in open society. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=145.84s)]
*  The thought that you will be hurt, or the people you love will be hurt, that's a different [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=147.28s)]
*  kind of thing, and this is what New York Times says. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=151.44s)]
*  The FBI has seen the number of threats against its personnel and facilities surge since its [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=153.72000000000003s)]
*  agents carried out the court-authorized search of Mar-a-Lago, has subsequently created a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  special unit to deal with the threats. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=162.24s)]
*  A U.S. official said threats since then have ridden more than 300 percent, in part because [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=164.44s)]
*  the identities of employees and information about them are being spread online. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=168.84s)]
*  What does this do to a society when this is now just an accepted part of how things operate? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=173.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's how we get to the GOP presidential debate where all of the candidates undercut [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=182.24s)]
*  their own power and humiliate themselves, raising their hands saying that they would [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=190.92s)]
*  support Donald Trump, who wasn't even there, even if he becomes a convicted felon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=196.72s)]
*  This is the politics of fear. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=202.32s)]
*  And what you're describing is these are dynamics that are also typical of corruption, because [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=204.72s)]
*  this is how fear is how corrupt authoritarians get people to do things. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=211.64s)]
*  But what Donald Trump's been doing, and we can look back at this, is what ever since [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=217.0s)]
*  fascism all authoritarians do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=222.6s)]
*  They try and change the perception of violence in the minds of the population, from something [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=224.68s)]
*  repugnant to something that becomes necessary and even morally righteous. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump's been doing this through his campaign events since 2015. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  When we cover in the media or otherwise his campaign rallies, his appearances, including [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  going to the gun store, these are radicalization events. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  And the goal is interesting because today, as January 6th proved and also January 8th [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  in Brazil, if you can't get the military to cooperate with your coup attempt or whatever [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=259.16s)]
*  you're trying to do, you have a civilian army that you've been cultivating, civilian thugs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  And so that's why there's an end game to this, cultivation of violence as well. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=271.76s)]
*  I want to, you know, it was a little striking to me that obviously I have to follow what [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=276.76s)]
*  he says on Truth Social professionally, George. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=281.11999999999995s)]
*  I want to trot out a theory to you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=285.0s)]
*  I think, you know, there's back and forth about, you know, back when he was tweeting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=287.0s)]
*  all the time and he's trying to distract you and live in your head, and how much attention [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=289.4s)]
*  should you give him? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  My general feeling is the sort of expressions of what you call his, you know, malignant [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  narcissism that was visible for all to see on social media really did hurt him in public [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=300.12s)]
*  perception. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=305.52s)]
*  It was one of the reasons he had such low favorables. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=306.52s)]
*  And it was one of the reasons that everyone on, you know, in the Republican Party be like, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=308.32s)]
*  gee, I wish he would stop tweeting. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=311.44s)]
*  But he's actually been weirdly aided a bit by sort of receding a little bit from people's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=313.16s)]
*  awareness where he's saying like, yeah, we should, you know, we should execute the Chairman [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=318.92s)]
*  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=324.56s)]
*  I'm going to come after, like stay tuned, he says. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=326.12s)]
*  I'm going to come after Comcast. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  That is not getting the attention it might have once had because people price it into [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=330.76s)]
*  what he says or because it's untrue social, but he's saying what he wants to do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=335.88s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=342.44s)]
*  I think in an odd sort of way, his banishment from Twitter actually helped him for exactly [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=343.44s)]
*  the reason you said. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=348.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=349.64s)]
*  And if I were a journalist being charged with assigned the task of doing a one-on-one interview [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=350.64s)]
*  with him, there are two approaches I might take. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=355.56s)]
*  One would be using the cross-examination approach that a lawyer would use. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=357.44s)]
*  But that's a little bit hard because you're not in a courtroom and he's not under oath. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  But the other thing I would do is I would sit with him facing me and I'd put a TV screen [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  between us and I would flash up 10 of the most outrageous social media posts that he's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=370.82s)]
*  issued in the last three or three months or so. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=378.67999999999995s)]
*  And I would highlight different parts of them and say, you said this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=385.7s)]
*  Do you really believe that? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=386.7s)]
*  And I would just get him to expand and expound upon that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=388.94s)]
*  And I think that would draw people's attention that this is the man who actually says this [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=392.58s)]
*  and he adopts all of those things and he means it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=397.18s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giott and George Conway, great to have you both. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=401.3s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=404.02s)]
*  So this evening in an extraordinary and rare move, a New York state judge found that Donald [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=406.58s)]
*  fraud without even needing a trial and a jury to weigh it on the evidence. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=412.18s)]
*  In the civil lawsuit brought by New York state attorney general Letitia James, the judge [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=416.86s)]
*  found the ex-president committed years-long business fraud, inflated his assets to get [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=421.36s)]
*  favorable loans and insurance deals. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=426.62s)]
*  The judge agreed with the state attorney general and the ruling is frankly scathing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=429.26s)]
*  The judge writes that quote, in Trump's world, rent regulated apartments are worth the same [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  as unregulated apartments. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=438.22s)]
*  Restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=440.3s)]
*  Restrictions can evaporate into thin air. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  That is a fantasy world, not the real world. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  The judge granted summary judgment on specifically the fraud claim, meaning the attorney general's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=447.86s)]
*  office proved or provided so much overwhelming evidence, the judge ruled it does not even [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=452.82s)]
*  need to go to trial. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=458.5s)]
*  Like that's it, you got me, I'm convinced. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  Now here's the other thing, as a remedy, the judge also ordered the cancellation of Donald [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump's business certificates in New York. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=469.38s)]
*  And this ruling tonight means the Trump organization in New York at least is basically facing legal [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=473.1s)]
*  extinction I think. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=479.42s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is a former litigator, now an MSNBC legal analyst. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=481.62s)]
*  Charles Komen prosecuted civil cases on behalf of the U.S. government, now is a civil rights [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=484.9s)]
*  and criminal defense attorney and they both join me now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=488.82s)]
*  Charles, let me just start with you on, I mean, in civil litigation parties will ask [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=491.82s)]
*  for summary judgment, the motion to dismiss summary judgment. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=496.82s)]
*  How often does the plaintiff get a summary, a judge being like, I've seen enough? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=501.02s)]
*  It is extraordinarily rare that this occurs. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=508.38s)]
*  Summary judgment as a notion as you were just talking about is one of the things that routinely [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=511.14s)]
*  is filed but isn't always granted. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=516.18s)]
*  And when you find it being granted, it's almost the equivalent of hitting a home run on the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=518.66s)]
*  first pitch. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=522.86s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=523.86s)]
*  It's very significant to lose on summary judgment and so I think there's something to be noted [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=525.54s)]
*  there of course. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=528.94s)]
*  But what is also important and noteworthy is the fact that there were sanctions for [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=530.22s)]
*  Trump's attorneys attached to this order. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=534.5s)]
*  That in and of itself is incredibly significant because judges are very much so loathe to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=537.26s)]
*  give out sanctions and they make a very compelling case as to why sanctions were issued here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=542.54s)]
*  I want to come back to the sanctions because that is also, this is also a theme we've seen [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=547.58s)]
*  in Trump litigation is like sanctions against attorneys, which again just doesn't happen [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  that often. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=553.7s)]
*  You see people practice before the court, you can push things as far as they go and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  not over and people don't do that and we don't see that often. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  Let's just, what is the finding here? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=561.62s)]
*  It was eight counts, right, that they were suing him over. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=563.94s)]
*  Seven I believe. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=567.0600000000001s)]
*  Seven. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  This is the first of seven. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  So there's going to be a trial on those others. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  What's the significance of what the judge found? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  Judge found that the attorney general's team offered enough proof to demonstrate that Donald [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=575.1s)]
*  Trump, his adult sons, Alan Weisselberg, the former CFO, Jeff McConney, the controller, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=580.9s)]
*  and a number of business entities engaged in a persistent years-long fraud through misrepresenting [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=586.38s)]
*  the values of various properties in his statements of financial condition. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=592.9399999999999s)]
*  Those are essentially like charts full of his assets making representations as to their [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=597.18s)]
*  value that are routinely provided to lenders, to insurance companies, and they say, the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=602.5s)]
*  judge says in this ruling, you have given me enough for me to find as an evidentiary [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=607.94s)]
*  ruling that he has engaged in this persistent fraud. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=613.74s)]
*  Just to be clear here, it's one thing whether you're on the Forbes list or not, but it doesn't [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=617.82s)]
*  matter really one way or the other. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=621.6600000000001s)]
*  When you go, I mean everyone knows this, but it's worth saying, when you go to a lender, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=623.6600000000001s)]
*  it matters how much you have in collateral in terms of the loan conditions and when you [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=627.3800000000001s)]
*  go to insurer, it matters how much or how little they're insuring. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=632.2600000000001s)]
*  If you're fudging on both of them, you're functionally defrauding them and taking money [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=635.76s)]
*  from both entities. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  That's true, and the judge says here, look, it doesn't matter to me that the bank still [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=640.4399999999999s)]
*  would have loaned you money or that they got repaid. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  What you're doing here is effectively messing with the integrity of public markets because [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=648.76s)]
*  if you can do this, then anyone can do this and nobody's representation means anything, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  and that's a bad thing for financial institutions. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=659.92s)]
*  And to your other point, Chris, of the remaining counts on the actual complaint, there is insurance [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=661.88s)]
*  fraud. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=666.96s)]
*  There are two insurance fraud counts that remain that are going to be litigated by Tish [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=667.96s)]
*  James and the Office of the Attorney General because of the fact that when you make these [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=671.68s)]
*  misrepresentations, it does change the scope and the tenor of what it is that you're asking [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=676.36s)]
*  for and how you are impacting the different markets. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=680.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, anyone's bought a house. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=682.96s)]
*  There's an appraiser, and they establish the value for the bank, the mortgage, and in fact, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=684.16s)]
*  one of the things, and I remember covering this, one of the things that went so haywire [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=689.68s)]
*  in the 2006, 2007 run up to the person above was that that whole system got juiced, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=692.12s)]
*  So you got people paying off appraisers to fudge the values. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=696.68s)]
*  You start doing that, things get real dicey. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=700.68s)]
*  Okay, so they find that there's going to be a trial on the other stuff. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=703.12s)]
*  I read the order revocation or I don't know what the word is, but the business licenses [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  essentially. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=715.4799999999999s)]
*  Right, cancellation of the business certificate. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=716.4799999999999s)]
*  Cancellation of the business certificate. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=717.4799999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=719.24s)]
*  It effectively means that you can't do business under a fictitious name here in New York. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=720.24s)]
*  The cancellation of the business certificates isn't really the worst form of relief. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  What really has the impact here is the order that the LLCs, meaning limited liability companies [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=730.54s)]
*  through which Donald Trump did business in New York, have to be dissolved because if [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=736.5s)]
*  you have to dissolve a company, then the question becomes, well, what do you do with the assets [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=741.0s)]
*  of those companies? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=744.9s)]
*  I asked that question to a source familiar with the litigation who said the assets can [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=746.06s)]
*  be sold, they can be transferred to be determined, but that will be up to a receiver appointed [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=750.6999999999999s)]
*  by the court and with the court's approval, disposition of these assets will be determined. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=756.78s)]
*  So there's like a court-appointed receiver ship in bankruptcy, a court-appointed receiver [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=762.4599999999999s)]
*  doing like a Trump or a garage sale? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=766.76s)]
*  Not necessarily a sale, there could be transfers, but to your point, one of the other things [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=771.06s)]
*  the attorney general has asked for here after trial is what's called disgorgement, basically [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  saying there are ill-gotten gains and we want $250 million at least from Trump. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=779.54s)]
*  The question becomes then, where do you get that $250 million if Trump's not liquid? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=785.48s)]
*  And that's where the receiver's disposition of the assets could be particularly important. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=790.12s)]
*  Here's one asset, the Trump Tower apartment in which Donald Trump resided for decades, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  roughly 11,000 square feet. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=797.92s)]
*  Between 2012 and 2016, Donald Trump submitted a statement of financial condition falsely [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=799.52s)]
*  claiming the triplex was 30,000 square feet, seems easily checkable, resulting in an overvaluation [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=803.3399999999999s)]
*  between $114 million to $207 million. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=809.02s)]
*  Good faith measurements could vary by as much as 10 per 20%, not 200%. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=812.38s)]
*  A discrepancy of this order of magnitude by a real estate developer sizing up his own [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=816.3399999999999s)]
*  living space for decades can only be considered fraud. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=819.76s)]
*  I love that line because it's like, well, it's hard to disagree with that. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=823.5s)]
*  And I think it's important to understand the standard with respect to summary judgment [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=826.9399999999999s)]
*  is that you consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=830.1s)]
*  So basically when the judge looked at this case and said, in the best light, looking [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=835.1800000000001s)]
*  at this for Donald Trump, is there any way that I can find that there is an issue of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=840.82s)]
*  dispute such that warrants a trial? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=845.0600000000001s)]
*  And the answer was a resounding no. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=847.24s)]
*  And I thought it was very interesting that he seized on that particular fact as an example [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=848.9s)]
*  of how extensive this fraud was to prove their point. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=853.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's not even the worst one. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=856.7s)]
*  That's not even the worst one, but when I read that one, I thought, right, and there's [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=858.42s)]
*  a whole bunch of other examples. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=861.74s)]
*  You write that and you think, yeah, he's dead to rights, which is basically what the judge [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=863.14s)]
*  decided tonight. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=866.9s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, Charles Coleman, thank you both. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=867.9s)]
*  The House MAGA caucus now appears to be getting their way. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=871.5s)]
*  After tanking a bunch of votes in highly humiliating fashion last week, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=874.74s)]
*  is negotiating with the far-right caucus to pass a spending bill that has no hope of becoming [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=879.5s)]
*  law. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=884.5s)]
*  But it would achieve the crucial objective and an 80% cut to Title I, annihilating one [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=885.5s)]
*  of the most important federal programs for low-income schools. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=890.66s)]
*  80%. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=894.1s)]
*  And not just that, it would also cut more than a million mothers and children from nutrition [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=895.1s)]
*  aid slash spending on home heating aid by 70% just ahead of winter and much more. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=899.18s)]
*  McCarthy has said his far-right members want to burn it all down, and that's true. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=905.34s)]
*  To a certain extent, they do. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=908.82s)]
*  But with four days until a shutdown, do not lose sight of the fact that in the end, they [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=910.18s)]
*  They do apparently have a policy objective, what they always want to do, which always [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=914.02s)]
*  seems to be to visit suffering on people, particularly the most vulnerable. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=918.7s)]
*  Ron Klain is former White House Chief of Staff for President Biden, and he joins me now. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=923.26s)]
*  I had to chuck a little bit today when Kevin McCarthy, after failing to even whip his own [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=927.58s)]
*  caucus on the rule before the vote, the vote before the vote, losing that twice for the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=931.7s)]
*  first time in like 20 years, said that the solution to the shutdown was to talk to President [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=936.58s)]
*  Biden. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=940.9s)]
*  So what do you make of what's going on in the House and what it's going to mean for [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=941.9s)]
*  the country? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=946.42s)]
*  Well, look, Chris, I mean, I think you hear people in Washington say all the time, I wish [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=947.42s)]
*  there was more bipartisanship. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  But in fact, there is a bipartisan agreement between President Biden and the Senate, which [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=952.42s)]
*  passed a key vote in the Senate night with 77 senators, vast majority of Republicans, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=956.14s)]
*  vast majority of Democrats, to keep the government open, to fund the war in Ukraine, and to help [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=960.98s)]
*  people with disaster relief. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=965.4599999999999s)]
*  So I had overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=967.1s)]
*  The problem isn't that Democrats and Republicans can't get along. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=970.34s)]
*  It's that House Republicans can't get along. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=971.94s)]
*  President Biden kind of deal with them about government spending when he averted the debt [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=974.6s)]
*  crisis, and now the Republicans in the House don't want to stick to the deal that they [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=977.7800000000001s)]
*  made. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=981.22s)]
*  They want to start all over again and close the government down. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=982.22s)]
*  So I think this just shows the dysfunction of the House Republican caucus. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=984.74s)]
*  And on the other hand, you can see that Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate can work [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=987.5s)]
*  together, make progress. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=990.82s)]
*  And it's a shame to see what's going on in the House right now. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=993.1800000000001s)]
*  The president, we just showed a clip of him on the picket line today in Michigan, the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=996.5s)]
*  striking United Auto Workers. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1000.8199999999999s)]
*  Stephen Ratner, who worked on the auto rescue under the Obama administration, said it was [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1002.78s)]
*  a bad idea. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1007.9s)]
*  He thought the president was doing the wrong thing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1008.9s)]
*  He's putting the thumb on the scale. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1010.54s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  Look, I saw President Biden in New York last week when he was up there for the U.N. General [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1012.8199999999999s)]
*  Assembly, and he said to me, Ron, I'm going to go to Detroit and march in the picket line. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1016.74s)]
*  And I said, well, of course, Mr. President, that's who you are. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1021.18s)]
*  That's who you've always been. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1023.38s)]
*  We saw that it was Joe Biden being Joe Biden. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1024.8600000000001s)]
*  He's been to picket lines many times as a senator. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1026.74s)]
*  It's his first time as president. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1029.0200000000002s)]
*  But this is who he is. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1030.5400000000002s)]
*  As he said today, you've heard him say it before. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1031.6200000000001s)]
*  He says Wall Street didn't build this country. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1035.1000000000001s)]
*  Middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1037.14s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden believes in the core of his being. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1040.1000000000001s)]
*  People heard him say it today in Detroit. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1042.3400000000001s)]
*  And of course, that's where he's going to be. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1044.3400000000001s)]
*  I want to show this. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1045.66s)]
*  I thought this chart on auto worker job creation over the last several presidents is pretty [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1046.66s)]
*  interesting. Jim Tankersley tweeted this out earlier. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1051.74s)]
*  Good economic reporter. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1054.5800000000002s)]
*  This is the created under recent presidents. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1056.5s)]
*  This is, I think, a per month average basically over the term of their president. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1059.3s)]
*  So you see Clinton plus 1800, George Bush minus almost 6000 plus 200, 2800 Obama Trump [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1062.98s)]
*  pre-COVID plus 200 Trump total minus 200 Biden plus 4000. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1069.7s)]
*  I mean, do you think that registers? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1075.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it registers with auto workers. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1079.38s)]
*  And I think I think everyone in America today saw their president stand up, stand up working [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1082.7s)]
*  people and say, as Steve Granite House said, that we've been through a period in our country [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1086.5400000000002s)]
*  where the corporate leaders have done very well. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1090.02s)]
*  They've made a lot of money. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1091.9s)]
*  And the people who are actually who are actually creating that wealth, the workers deserve [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1092.9s)]
*  to share in that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1096.42s)]
*  They deserve to share in it, particularly in the auto industry, where the people who [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1097.42s)]
*  are out there on strike, they all took big pay cuts when the auto industry was in trouble [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1100.66s)]
*  in 2009. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1104.42s)]
*  They agreed to help save the auto industry by cutting their pay in bad times. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1105.46s)]
*  Now that the industry is making record profits, they deserve to share in those profits and [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1109.14s)]
*  get their just rewards for having sacrificed to save the American auto industry. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvCF6bWPFM&t=1113.1000000000001s)]
