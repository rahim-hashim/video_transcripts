# Stormy on the stand? Trump hush money trial witness list revealed
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump's first criminal trial for allegedly paying hush money to an adult film star to cover up their relationship is scheduled to begin at 9 30 a.m. In Manhattan this coming Monday morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=0.0s)]
*  I say scheduled because well it's taken some years to get to this point hasn't it. The money was paid to Stormy Daniels back in the fall of 2016 right before the election. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=14.0s)]
*  Now nearly eight years later Trump might actually be held accountable for his misdeeds. There's an old social media meme. I'd like to see old Donnie Trump wriggle out of this way out of this jam. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=24.0s)]
*  And then of course he wriggles out of it. Well nevertheless that meme itself is almost eight years old and eight years later Trump is still wriggling though not with as much success as he used to have. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=35.0s)]
*  Three times this week his lawyers asked the courts to delay the start of this trial on Monday. A judge said no on Tuesday. Another judge said no on Wednesday. Yet another judge said no today in the clear sign this might actually be happening. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=48.0s)]
*  NBC News obtained a list of potential trial witnesses for the prosecution. It is sure to give the former president some agita. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=61.0s)]
*  The list includes Stormy Daniels of course the adult film actress who alleges that she slept with Trump in 2006 during a golf tournament while Melania was home with their newborn son Baron and says she was paid off to stay quiet about the affair just weeks before the 2016 election. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=68.0s)]
*  They like to make their problems go away. We can also hear from Karen McDougall a former Playboy playmate who also alleges an affair with Donald Trump and alleges she was also paid off in that same period in 2016. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=98.0s)]
*  Why do you think it was that it was after Donald Trump was the Republican nominee that they came back. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=111.0s)]
*  They wanted to squash the story. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=120.0s)]
*  Both of their payoffs were negotiated by celebrity lawyer Keith Davidson. He says he's already turned over 1500 pages of evidence to federal investigators and he could also testify a source of knowledge tells NBC News as good Dylan Howard that's the former editor in chief from the National [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=122.0s)]
*  Inquirer and more importantly really his boss that would be American media CEO David Pecker that gentleman there on the right of your screen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=137.0s)]
*  They reportedly acted as Trump's eyes and ears for negative stories including the allegations by Daniels and McDougal. They paid McDougal a six figure sum for the rights to her story so they could quietly bury it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=145.0s)]
*  The so-called catch and kill tactic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=156.0s)]
*  There's also hope picks that Trump campaign and White House aid who participated in phone calls with Trump and Cohen around the time the Sorny Daniels payoff. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=159.0s)]
*  She could testify along with several other Trump organization and White House officials. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=167.0s)]
*  The star witness of course maybe Trump's one time fixture Michael Cohen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=172.0s)]
*  He's the lawyer who has already pleaded guilty and done jail time for his role in this case for what he did. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=176.0s)]
*  He says he was the guy who set up the whole hush money operation at Trump's request using his own money. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=183.0s)]
*  He's champion of the bit to testify against Trump as he told Jen Psaki last month. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, he should be worried about me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=194.0s)]
*  He should be worried about the Manhattan district attorney the district attorney of New York prosecutors. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=196.0s)]
*  He should be worried about the documentary evidence. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=201.0s)]
*  He should be worried about all of the witnesses that are going to be coming in to that trial simply because as others have also appropriately put it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=203.0s)]
*  This is a very simple case. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=214.0s)]
*  And if you're wondering what the evidence Michael Cohen is talking about what he could possibly testify about. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=218.0s)]
*  Well, we know actually he laid it out in simple terms under oath before the House Oversight Committee way back in 2019. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=222.0s)]
*  Picture this scene in February of 2017 one month into his presidency. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=231.0s)]
*  I'm visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time and it's truly awe inspiring. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=239.0s)]
*  He's showing me all around and pointing to different paintings and he says to me something to the effect of don't worry Michael. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=246.0s)]
*  Your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=255.0s)]
*  They were FedEx from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=259.0s)]
*  As he promised I received the first check for the reimbursement of seventy thousand dollars not long thereafter. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=265.0s)]
*  The president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=273.0s)]
*  As Cohen said it is a simple case Donald Trump wanted to be president. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=286.0s)]
*  He wanted to bury negative stories that might endanger his campaign and he sought the help of consigliere who is now ready to testify against him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=290.0s)]
*  Again in a trial that we'll see finally begins on Monday. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sk3FUhMaU&t=296.0s)]
