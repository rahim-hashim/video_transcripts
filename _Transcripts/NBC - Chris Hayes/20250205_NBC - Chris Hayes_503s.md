# ‘He has billions at stake': The real reason behind Elon Musk’s government takeover
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8)
*  Good evening from San Diego. I'm Chris Hayes. The anger is rising. You can feel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=0.0s)]
*  it as the world's richest man, Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire is unlawfully [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=5.28s)]
*  hollowing out the United States government, seizing control of payment [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=10.52s)]
*  and personnel systems of the data of millions of Americans, trying to shut [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=14.44s)]
*  down agencies that Congress duly created. Americans across the country in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=19.02s)]
*  protests and demonstrations and teach-ins are focusing their outrage on [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=24.16s)]
*  Musk with calls of fire Elon, even though it is not entirely clear who he [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=28.28s)]
*  is working for other than himself. We're gonna have much more on those protests [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=33.32s)]
*  later in the show. They are growing. The Musk is skill pushing on, continuing to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=37.88s)]
*  invade government systems. Today staffers with his extra governmental [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=41.96s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency reportedly entered the headquarters of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=46.36s)]
*  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Maryland, as well as [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=49.92s)]
*  the building of its parent agency, the Department of Commerce in Washington. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  They apparently just sort of walked past security and said, Get out of my way, and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=58.0s)]
*  they're looking for access to the IT systems as they have in other agencies. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=61.64s)]
*  Andrew Rosenberg, a former NOAA official with knowledge of the incident, told [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=65.84s)]
*  Mother Jones, he added, they will have access to the entire computer system, a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=69.52s)]
*  lot of which is confidential information. Now, it should be noted here [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=73.84s)]
*  that Project 2025, the right wing blueprint for Trump's second term, which [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=77.68s)]
*  pulled abysmally and Trump tried to deny he had anything to do with. Well, look [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=81.92s)]
*  at that. It called for NOAA to be broken up and downsized because its role in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=86.56s)]
*  promoting climate science was harmful to U.S. prosperity. Musk staffers have also [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=90.48s)]
*  gained access to payment and contracting systems at the extremely important and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  crucial Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That is the source of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=101.88s)]
*  health insurance for more than 150 million older and poorer Americans. And [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=106.2s)]
*  again, as with much of this, what is he doing with that access? Totally unclear. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=110.72s)]
*  Who knows? He did post on the social media platform he owns saying, yeah, this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=114.56s)]
*  is where the big money fraud is happening. This all comes on the heels of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=119.28s)]
*  Musk's other moves, including his sudden and illegal attempt to shut down the U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=123.28s)]
*  Agency for International Development, which is already wreaking havoc on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=127.32s)]
*  public health and life saving aid around the world. And his takeover of the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=130.68s)]
*  Department of Treasury's internal payment system that manages the payments of six [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=135.16s)]
*  trillion dollars of U.S. government money. Trump officials continue to insist [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  that Musk's access to that crucial, basically the government's bank account, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=144.76s)]
*  that that access is read only. Insiders say otherwise. Multiple sources telling [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  WIRE that a 25 year old engineer named Marco Elas, who previously worked for two [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=155.92s)]
*  Elon Musk companies, has direct access to Treasury Department systems responsible [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=161.28s)]
*  for nearly all payments made by the U.S. government. Two of those sources say that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=165.92s)]
*  Elas's privileges include the ability not just to read, but to write code on two [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=170.44s)]
*  of the most sensitive systems in the U.S. government. These systems control on a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=175.76s)]
*  granular level government payments that in their totality amount to, ready for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  this, more than a fifth of the entire U.S. economy. One 25 year old mucking [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  around in that system. This is just a fraction of what the world's richest man, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=192.44s)]
*  a guy that no one voted for, a guy who's actually constitutionally banned for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=198.04s)]
*  running for president, has done to take over the U.S. government. And so [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, tasked of course with the duty [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=205.4s)]
*  of oversight, tried to do some of that oversight today to subpoena Musk to just [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=209.84s)]
*  have him come to testify before the committee about what he's up to. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=215.16s)]
*  Interestingly, the committee's Republican members refused to allow debate on the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=218.96s)]
*  motion. And when Democrats argued that, chaos unfolded. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=222.32s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I think it's outrageous that this committee will not even [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=227.68s)]
*  entertain a motion. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=231.48s)]
*  No, you state your position. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  That's not a point of order. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, I agree. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  I have my point of order. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, somebody who is breaking the law and dismantling our federal [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  agent, Rob Holt, and firing federal police and taxing personal data. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Out of order. Out of order. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=244.76s)]
*  And you will not even entertain a motion to bring him to the president of people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=245.76s)]
*  who are in favor of tabling. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=250.24s)]
*  Yes, let's have order in this country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=252.8s)]
*  You're out of order. You know, you're out of order. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=255.28s)]
*  You know the rules of this committee. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=257.72s)]
*  There's been a motion. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=259.68s)]
*  Mr. Elon Musk is out of order and dismantling. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=260.68s)]
*  Is that a word? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=263.12s)]
*  I call the question. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=264.36s)]
*  There's been a motion and second motion by Dr. Fox, second by Mr. Higgins to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=266.0s)]
*  table all those in favor of tabling signify by saying aye. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=272.92s)]
*  Aye. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=276.88s)]
*  All those opposed signify by saying no. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=278.12s)]
*  No. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=280.6s)]
*  In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=281.6s)]
*  It's interesting. They're very, very precise about their rules, like who gets [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=285.76s)]
*  to wield power in their committee seem less precise about that in other domains. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=290.04s)]
*  Now, the move to subpoena Musk was quashed by the House Republicans tasked [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=295.68s)]
*  with doing government oversight. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=299.24s)]
*  Obviously, they don't want him before them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=300.48s)]
*  One of the main reasons why this is so important is because Elon Musk, the man [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=302.6s)]
*  Republicans are letting dismantle, muck with swaths of the federal government, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=306.44s)]
*  has a direct personal and financial interest in dismantling much of the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=312.6s)]
*  government. He has a walking conflict of interest. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=316.04s)]
*  I won't even mention all of the investigations into safety issues or regulatory [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=319.6s)]
*  oversight. But let me give you an example here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=323.88s)]
*  He bragged he spent last weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  The same that came a day after he posted, quote, USAID is a criminal organization [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  in time for it to die. What must never mention anywhere was that USAID's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=336.04s)]
*  inspector general was in the process of investigating its own public private [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=339.68s)]
*  partnership between must Starlink and the Ukrainian government at the time that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=343.44s)]
*  the billionaires doge crippled the agency. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=347.36s)]
*  That investigation was launched for the public announcement last year, its status [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=350.72s)]
*  now unknown. But I think you can take a guess if it will continue. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  Those Starlink consoles were just a fraction of the business that Musk does [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=358.16s)]
*  must companies do with the federal government over the past decade. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=361.64000000000004s)]
*  Just two of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have won more than 15 billion [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=364.44s)]
*  dollars in contracts, according to the New York Times, not chump change. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=369.0s)]
*  Most of that comes from his space business, which effectively dictates NASA's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=372.24s)]
*  rocket launch schedule. Last September, the FAA announced plans to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=375.96s)]
*  find SpaceX for skirting launch safety rules, including using an unapproved [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=380.4s)]
*  launch control room. That same day, Musk lashed out, saying humanity will [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=385.32s)]
*  forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=389.6s)]
*  A week after that, Musk called for the resignation of the FAA's chief. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=393.72s)]
*  Then last month, in the final days of the Biden administration, a space starship, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=397.12s)]
*  SpaceX Starship, exploded shortly after takeoff, spreading an estimated 100 tons [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=401.36s)]
*  of debris beyond protected areas. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=406.56s)]
*  Air traffic controllers had to deal with the aftermath of that with the planes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=408.68s)]
*  that they were guiding safely. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=412.4s)]
*  There are reports of debris and damage on the Turks and Caicos Islands. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=414.04s)]
*  Air traffic in the area had to be briefly diverted. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=418.16s)]
*  SpaceX announced it had undergone a, quote, rapid, unscheduled disassembly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=420.6s)]
*  The FAA immediately grounded SpaceX, barring future launches until an [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  investigation could be conducted. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=429.92s)]
*  Three days later, Donald Trump became president and the FAA administrator, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=432.24s)]
*  who Elon Musk wanted out, announced his resignation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  Given all that, given Elon Musk's penchant for exploding rocket ships, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=440.16s)]
*  what he likes to call rapid, unscheduled disassembly, you'd think he's the last [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=444.0s)]
*  guy the FAA would want weighing in on issues of public transportation safety, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=449.2s)]
*  especially when those issues were just illustrated the stakes of recently. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  But you would think wrong. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=457.96s)]
*  As a former TV reality star and newly minted transportation secretary, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=459.76s)]
*  Sean Duffy, posted today on Musk's platform, quote, big news, talk to the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=463.4s)]
*  Doge team, they're going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  Just the world's richest man who's been empowered to get into the back end of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=472.08s)]
*  virtually every facet of the US government and do what every wants, while he has [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=475.88s)]
*  billions and billions and billions of dollars at stake. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkqqEbbYC8&t=479.32s)]
