# ‘Nothing’: Maddow says Trump lawyers ‘didn’t bring it’ for Cohen cross-examination
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww)
*  We are joined now by Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell who was also at the courthouse today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, and look the simple [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=6.12s)]
*  Scorecard reporting is not a single point [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Relevant point was scored against Michael Cohen on cross-examination [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  To everyone's surprise the demeanor held up because that was the suspense of last night. The suspense was wow [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=17.36s)]
*  That's the most remarkable version of Michael Cohen [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=23.62s)]
*  We've ever seen you know those of us who watched him in the courtroom yesterday, but can he do it on cross when he's challenged? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=26.32s)]
*  He's such a defensive guy. He's such a combative guy in every other environment, but he was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=32.7s)]
*  Contained as most people are by the pressures on the confines of the courtroom, especially the witness stand [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=39.84s)]
*  You know you got to remember that when lives end up in a criminal court [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=46.92s)]
*  And you are the key witness for a criminal prosecution [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=52.92s)]
*  Yours is a broken life [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  because you are here as the eye witness to your friend's murder and you are part of a tragedy yourself and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  So Michael Cohen's life was broken by all of this and what you saw on the witness stand was this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=69.64s)]
*  Broken man, and I love some of the what we saw from the courtroom art [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=76.76s)]
*  There's so that the capturing of Michael Cohen's mournful face, which is what this was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  This was someone mourning for his own mistakes mourning for his own [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=87.56s)]
*  Terrible mistakes these made in his life and then describing eventually what was a family [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=93.48s)]
*  Intervention to get him to turn away [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=98.68s)]
*  From what was literally his life of crime with Donald Trump and save what could be left of his life [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=102.88s)]
*  By the simple course of telling the truth to prosecutors doing time in prison [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  It turns out is going to be a consequence of this and you know and Chris one thing I'd say about Michael Cohen's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  pauses on answering questions is I took every one of those to actually be a smart moment and that just might be you know, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=119.96s)]
*  The jury won't be thinking the way I am about it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=125.88s)]
*  But having seen a lot of witnesses, especially lawyer witnesses [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=128.44s)]
*  What he's doing is he's listening to every word you just said and deciding [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=132.44s)]
*  How to answer it whether he should answer it whether he should ask for clarification and it never felt to me like there was something [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=137.48s)]
*  Weird about the pause but it could to a judge who doesn't know that that's what I see going through his mind [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=144.92s)]
*  Yeah, and there was a little bit of this. There's a little bit this thing happened and having been through depositions [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=151.22s)]
*  You know that there's a little bit of this a question is asked and you sort of quibble the characterization [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=155.64s)]
*  So you brush it back a little bit so that Blanche comes back [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  Was he at one point there was a big standoff other we said was that a lie he says well, it wasn't truthful [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=164.9s)]
*  Yes, but was it a lie. Well, if you want to call it lies, like I'm not asking if you want me to call it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=170.38000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I haven't even you call it a lot. There's a few of those standoffs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=174.94s)]
*  but again, yes, I think that was intentional on Cohen's part right because [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=178.5s)]
*  He is a lawyer. He is being careful and he does understand the weight and I think that last point [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=183.18s)]
*  You know the weight of all this sure which I again when we were talking yesterday and everyone was talking [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  Is this gonna last it was very clear today that kind of spectral presence that he had this sort of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=193.26s)]
*  Broken guy who's you know that that remained throughout rich Rachel obviously you were following [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=198.06s)]
*  Wrapped closely today. I'm sure [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=205.5s)]
*  What was your big takeaway? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=208.54s)]
*  My big takeaway was is this all there is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=211.42s)]
*  I'm the defense. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I think that you know [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=215.26s)]
*  The defense is under no obligation to put any witnesses forward at all [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=219.9s)]
*  Lawrence has been very [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=223.78s)]
*  Articulate and persuasive and saying that there's zero percent chance that they will put the defendant that they will put their own client [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=225.9s)]
*  Donald Trump on on the stand in his own defense, but we don't know if they'll put anybody and so if they don't [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=232.18s)]
*  this is their defense the cross-examination of Michael Cohen is the defenses case and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=240.74s)]
*  To get what what Blanche was able to get out of him today [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=246.1s)]
*  There was nothing which either makes me feel like they must be incredibly confident in their ability [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=250.61999999999998s)]
*  to try to get a mistrial ruling here or [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=256.46s)]
*  Something surprising is gonna happen on Thursday, or they just didn't bring it because there really was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=260.02s)]
*  Nothing, especially when you consider that when the prosecution laid out their case at the outset [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=265.9s)]
*  They basically said this is a documents case we are gonna put Michael Cohen on the stand [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  He's a very controversial guy and for good reason and you're gonna hear about why [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=275.5s)]
*  But everything that we are going to need to prove to you in order for you to come back with a guilty verdict [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  Will be bolstered by corroborating evidence by multiple witnesses and by documents and thus far they spent the last couple of weeks doing that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=284.62s)]
*  Giving all the documents authenticating all the documents giving all the corroborating witness testimony [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=291.26s)]
*  They get to their culminating witness Michael Cohen and he performs [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=295.7s)]
*  Perfectly as a witness for them. He doesn't lose his cool as you guys were saying he answers all the right questions. He [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=300.46s)]
*  Doesn't seem to you know, go into weird soliloquies or sidebars that might be picked apart on cross-examination [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  They hand him over to the defense today after lunch. I have to tell you I was on tenterhooks [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  I thought this was it. This is how we're going to see if they're gonna keep Donald Trump out of prison and it was just nothing [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=318.26s)]
*  So maybe Thursday is gonna be something [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=323.58s)]
*  But otherwise it looks like they're just not mounting a defense at all. I was um, I was struck by the same thing not only [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=327.38s)]
*  That's you know, where's the beef? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  but also the sort of spaghetti against the wall nature of the line of questioning from from from the defense Rachel just [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=337.70000000000005s)]
*  They tried to paint Cohen as a bunch of different things an unreliable narrator or grifter or you know [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=344.62s)]
*  Someone who was in it for himself selfish or a spurned lover [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=351.76s)]
*  Someone who was obsessed with Donald Trump and then when he was cast aside for you know [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=355.84s)]
*  Not getting a position in the White House not getting Reince Priebus his job. He was you know intent on destroying Donald Trump [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Did you find any of those characterizations particularly effective? I [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=365.56s)]
*  Might have found any one of them effective had the prosecution [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=370.67999999999995s)]
*  Not laid all of them out in advance to tell us put them all in context and tell us all what they mean [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=375.84s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know that Michael Cohen had called [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=381.48s)]
*  The defense lawyer Todd Blanch a crying little [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=385.68s)]
*  Swear word like the very first thing that he led with I didn't know that he had like complained about Trump's defense lawyers in a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  Tik Tok video or something like that was new. Okay, is that gonna change my view about what Michael Cohen brings to this case? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=395.72s)]
*  No, but the the prosecution did a good job at eliciting from all of the other witnesses. Oh, yeah, I couldn't stand Michael Cohen [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=401.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Michael Cohen called himself a lawyer Michael Cohen. Oh a fixer [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=409.04s)]
*  He only fixes things that he broke we got all of this stuff all of the ad hominem anything you could want about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=412.88s)]
*  Michael Cohen we've already had and then they put it all in context. Here's what he was when he served Donald Trump [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=418.88s)]
*  Here is when he stopped serving Donald Trump. Here is what he has done since here are the sins [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  He is committed in the way he is atoned. It's all been out there in advance [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=430.24s)]
*  So for Todd Blanch to be up there is Donald Trump's defense lawyer saying [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=433.44s)]
*  Oh, but Michael Cohen didn't you lie to Congress the jury must be sitting there thinking yeah, we heard the explanation for that already [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=437.36s)]
*  We know what that is. Why are you bringing it up again? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=443.36s)]
*  The thing that struck me today on that on that point on the cross is again. I do think I mean there are plausible [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=446.56s)]
*  stories to tell here like for instance [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=454.44s)]
*  Right when they're spending a lot of time on his podcast and the fact that you sell merges a moment [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=456.4s)]
*  The different merchandise you sell on your website or your associated websites to show Donald Trump in prison and send him to the big house [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  Not the White House. And is that about President Trump? And yes, it is. Okay, there's a story that tells us this guy is so out for revenge [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  He's gonna say whatever it takes to put him behind bars, which is what's being implied [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  But that point part at least was legible to me [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=477.96s)]
*  There were large parts of the cross today that I could not follow and I I think I'm pretty good [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=481.88s)]
*  Following stuff generally I followed most of I followed the direct there were and part of this [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=488.16s)]
*  I'll just say is like a small color thing and this is something we can talk about with our legal experts of Lawrence [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=493.8s)]
*  You want to weigh in? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=498.92s)]
*  In the direct all of the evidence is being put up for all of us to see [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=500.12s)]
*  Which is extremely helpful because you see the documents. Here's the pay stub for your May invoice [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=505.0s)]
*  during the cross [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=510.72s)]
*  When they would present a document to Michael Cohen to refresh his memory it was not admitted into evidence broadly [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=512.72s)]
*  Which meant he's looking at a screen. You don't see what the document is again. This is intentional and it means that it's really hard [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  to pull the whole thing there were long lines of questioning where I was like [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=527.72s)]
*  I'm just lost here. What are you talking about? I was like, what are we doing with the phones? Right? Why are we on the phone still? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=531.76s)]
*  I don't get the phones thing and it got a little worse because Michael Cohen's looking at a document that none of us can see [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=538.0s)]
*  And he's saying you are misrepresenting what's on this document [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=543.16s)]
*  Okay, so it's not working on any level but hey, welcome to the representation of a guilty client [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=547.04s)]
*  This is what it looks like when a criminal defense lawyer has a client who did exactly [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=554.08s)]
*  What Stormy Daniels says he did this is what it looks like when you're representing a client who did indeed? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=559.52s)]
*  Conspire to create false business records. They don't have if they had something better [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=566.84s)]
*  You would have heard it in the first ten minutes. They don't have anything better [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=571.96s)]
*  You're not gonna hear anything better and the game is and it's a legitimate legal game is [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=575.76s)]
*  is they're gonna try to create not just reasonable doubt but [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=581.44s)]
*  Presidential level reasonable doubt they're gonna want you to bring a higher level of reasonable doubt [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=586.44s)]
*  This man was president so you can't possibly convict him on the word of that man, right? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXMrQZzAuww&t=592.56s)]
