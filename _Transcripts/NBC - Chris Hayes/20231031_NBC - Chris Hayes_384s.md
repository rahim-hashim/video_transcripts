# ‘Ridiculous’: Biden advisor hits House GOP for lumping tax cheats for the wealthy with Israel aid
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0)
*  Nero Tanden serves as domestic policy advisor for President Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=0.0s)]
*  She's taking part in the administration's new plan to combat anti-Semitism across the country. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=3.2s)]
*  And she joins me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=8.0s)]
*  Now, I want to start on the domestic policy front because it's something you've worked on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=8.8s)]
*  And I have to say, I really did not. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=13.4s)]
*  Well, I should have seen it coming. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=17.2s)]
*  But what is your reaction to the first big ask of the new Republican leadership being like, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=18.6s)]
*  We want you to defund the tax police, basically, make it easier for people to take care of their taxes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  And we won't vote for aid unless we get that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=31.0s)]
*  Well, I think it is a basic repudiation of the need for aid for Israel, for humanitarian aid. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=35.8s)]
*  The idea that they are saying that we should, in essence, make it easier for people to, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=44.0s)]
*  for the very wealthy, the extremely wealthy, to cheat on their taxes by getting rid of IRS enforcement is ridiculous. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=51.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with this issue. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=60.8s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the crisis. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  It actually really destabilizes the consensus that on emergency funding, we don't have, quote unquote, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=64.8s)]
*  pay-fors. And again, this isn't even a pay-for because it adds to the deficit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=73.8s)]
*  So it's not actually paying for the money. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=78.4s)]
*  It is actually not a pay-for for Israel, because, for the Israel funding, because it actually makes our budget deficits much worse [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  by making sure we have less revenue coming into the federal government. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  So while it's a sop to people's donors, it is actually not an answer in any way, shape or form to the problems that we're seeing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, in this moment of crisis, it really speaks to a lack of seriousness to take on this international challenge [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=103.4s)]
*  and aid to Israel, as well as aid to Gaza that is so vital right now, in addition to our support for Ukraine [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=112.2s)]
*  and the critical investments in border security. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=118.8s)]
*  Just on that point, I want to just hammer that home. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=123.0s)]
*  But it is not, it's the opposite of a pay-for. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=125.4s)]
*  That's also part of what's so wildly, almost sublimely perverse about it, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=127.6s)]
*  So first of all, the consensus is that you don't offset this sort of emergency funding. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=133.0s)]
*  But if you're going to offset it, which is a pay-for, you need to raise revenue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  This does the opposite. This is IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  Daniel Werfel, he says it will cost $90 billion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=143.2s)]
*  All those funds to increase scrutiny on tax evasion going over the highest levels, he says, leaving money on the table. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=147.2s)]
*  $90 billion is more, if I'm not mistaken, than the amount of military aid being asked for the total for Ukraine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=152.2s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot of money. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=158.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And honestly, these are the moments where the lectures on deficit reduction are just totally hypocritical. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=160.6s)]
*  Because in this moment, at this time, where we do face an international crisis, where we're called on for leadership, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=169.0s)]
*  where people talk about their support for Israel, they actually are making it more difficult to pass this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a nonstarter in the Senate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  And honestly, they're making this package much more expensive by getting rid of IRS enforcement, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  which is really about ensuring that we have revenue into the federal government. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=195.6s)]
*  So it really rings hollow on every front. Support for Israel, support for international security, and focus on deficits. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=199.4s)]
*  Now, I know your portfolio tends to be domestic policy, and that's what you've been focusing on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=207.0s)]
*  I'm not going to ask you about specific foreign policy questions amidst this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=210.6s)]
*  But I do want to ask you about the work that you're doing, meeting with Jewish leaders on anti-Semitism. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=214.6s)]
*  And what you have been doing and what you have been hearing is obviously people are still reeling from the awfulness of the attacks, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=219.7s)]
*  but also some of the truly vile stuff that we've seen Jewish stars being graffitied in Paris, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=227.0s)]
*  the images out of Dagestan in Russia, that people chasing down an airport looking for Jewish folks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=233.4s)]
*  What have you heard from the folks that you've been meeting with? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=240.4s)]
*  Well, we have seen in the last several weeks a rise of anti-Semitic acts, violence, threats of violence here in the United States, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=244.4s)]
*  on college campuses and elsewhere. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=255.4s)]
*  We saw, obviously, this weekend an incident at Cornell where there are specific threats against Jewish students. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=257.4s)]
*  All of this is horrifying. The president put forward the first national strategy to counter anti-Semitism. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=265.4s)]
*  Part of that was increased actions by the Department of Education. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=272.4s)]
*  So before October 7th, they put forward guidance that made clear that anti-Semitism is prohibited discrimination. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=278.4s)]
*  In the last several weeks, they have been reaching out to college campuses. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=288.4s)]
*  And the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security have also been engaged to just focus on the fact that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=292.4s)]
*  violence or threats of violence against individuals or groups are just illegal. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=299.4s)]
*  They are being prosecuted. And there's been information out today about what's happening, what happened in Cornell. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=306.4s)]
*  But it is, we are seeing a significant rise. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=314.4s)]
*  I will say at the same time, in the country we are seeing a rise in anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, Islamophobic acts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=317.4s)]
*  Obviously, we were heartbroken. The president expressed how heartbroken he was about the murder of a six-year-old child in Illinois. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=327.4s)]
*  So we have also been combating Islamophobia. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=336.4s)]
*  And really, the president's message here is that there is no space for hate in this country, that regardless of the events internationally, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=340.4s)]
*  we stand against hate. And our Department of Justice, our Department of Education, and the Department of Homeland Security are acting in accordance. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=350.4s)]
*  All right, and your attendance, thank you for making some time tonight. I appreciate it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=360.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0loaEzar0&t=380.4s)]
