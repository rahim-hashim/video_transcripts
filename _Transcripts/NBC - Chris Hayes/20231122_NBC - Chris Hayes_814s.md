# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 21
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI)
*  There's this very late night convening of the cabinet to assess the deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=0.0s)]
*  Do we know anything about what is happening? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=5.0s)]
*  Yeah, good night from here, Chris. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=10.0s)]
*  We know that minutes ago the Israeli government did vote to pass the deal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=13.0s)]
*  It was not unanimous and Netanyahu's most extreme right ministers, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=19.0s)]
*  including I think one or two from his own party, did not support it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=25.0s)]
*  But out of the 38 minister government this passed comfortably, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=30.0s)]
*  there are expected to be very limited appeals to the Supreme Court presented even tonight, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=34.0s)]
*  right now, 3, 4 in the morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=42.0s)]
*  And those appeals would be against specific names of Palestinian prisoners [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=44.0s)]
*  who are going to be published in the coming minutes, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=50.0s)]
*  those that will be exchanged, and family members of the victims of those people [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=53.0s)]
*  have the right to appeal specific names. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=58.0s)]
*  Ironically, the right-wing organizations who were hoping to appeal against this whole decision [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=61.0s)]
*  and say that it was illegitimate are limited from doing it by a law [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=67.0s)]
*  that Netanyahu himself passed pre-war when he was trying to do a judicial overhaul. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=71.0s)]
*  Yes, this is the Times reporting on the possible Palestinian prisoners [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=78.0s)]
*  who might be included in such a deal, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=83.0s)]
*  saying that negotiations around the release of Israeli women and children [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=85.0s)]
*  held hostage in Gaza centered on exchange for Palestinian women and minors held in Israeli prisons. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=89.0s)]
*  Many of the most recent arrests came during raids across the Israeli-occupied West Bank [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=94.0s)]
*  where protests and violence have surged, including attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=98.0s)]
*  Israel has said the arrests are part of a counter-terrorism operation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=102.0s)]
*  against Hamas and the West Bank. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=105.0s)]
*  Rights groups have long warned that Palestinian detainees are held without due process [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=107.0s)]
*  and face abuse and even torture. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=111.0s)]
*  So these would be these prisoners who are part of this exchange, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=114.0s)]
*  it sounds like will mostly be women and children themselves. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=117.0s)]
*  Is there any additional reporting about the pause aspect of this, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=121.0s)]
*  about there being some cessation of hostilities for some period of time? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=127.0s)]
*  There is, and as you said, we should underline how complicated it is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=132.0s)]
*  The understanding that I have here is that the initial batch of Israeli hostages to be released [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=137.0s)]
*  counts, as you said, about 50, but they're not going to be released all on Thursday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=144.0s)]
*  They're going to be released at about the pace of 10 a day over four or five days. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=149.0s)]
*  And what Hamas is promising is that if Israel then extends the pause, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=155.0s)]
*  it will search for more children in particular, search for more. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=160.0s)]
*  You know, Israel has about 240 hostages, so the release of 50 would still leave 190 Israelis, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=165.0s)]
*  or I want to emphasize this, foreigners captured in Israel, tourists, agricultural workers, aid workers, you name it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=173.0s)]
*  These people are not being counted. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=183.0s)]
*  Israel has explicitly said any non-Israeli citizens are not counted in exchange for the Palestinian prisoners. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=185.0s)]
*  But these are all counted as Israeli hostages taken from Israeli territory. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=192.0s)]
*  So I think that if the deal goes ahead and it proceeds well, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=197.0s)]
*  what we're seeing is at least five days of a truce that I think will include also the cessation of Israeli spy drones [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=203.0s)]
*  activities over Gaza, which leads to a lot of questions about what Hamas is planning to do during that time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=212.0s)]
*  And that then Hamas plans to kind of dangle this possibility of further hostage releases over several days, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=220.0s)]
*  ideally for it to try and change this truce into a permanent ceasefire. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=231.0s)]
*  Let me just say that we can now, you just said this, so I'm not telling the viewers anything they don't know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=238.0s)]
*  but NBC News now confirming and reporting that the Israeli cabinet has, as Noga was just saying, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=242.0s)]
*  passed the 38 ministers have by majority approved this deal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=248.0s)]
*  Again, the contours of the deal are not public or written down anywhere, so we're still sort of figuring this out based on reporting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=254.0s)]
*  But the deal has been approved. It was not unanimous. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=261.0s)]
*  There was opposition, as Noga said, some of the more far-right members of that government, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=263.0s)]
*  including some members Netanyahu's Likud party as well. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=268.0s)]
*  The prime minister's office, the Israeli government meeting has just ended. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=272.0s)]
*  This is the prime minister's office. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=276.0s)]
*  The decision on the outline of the hostage deal passed by a majority of votes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=277.0s)]
*  That's what we have. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=281.0s)]
*  So we have approval, it seems. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=282.0s)]
*  We have our understanding of the basic contours of this and particularly about this sort of attenuated release of hostages [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=284.0s)]
*  in exchange for cessation of hostilities as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=292.0s)]
*  I guess my final question for you is like what the sort of political discourse around this in Israel has been like. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=295.0s)]
*  Obviously, I think I can imagine right now family members of the hostages in this just unbelievably intense [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=303.0s)]
*  and difficult period right now of wondering like is their loved one going to be one of the ones? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=311.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=318.0s)]
*  I mean the word for this is heartbreaking. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=320.0s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=322.0s)]
*  There have been aspects that have been disgraceful with some of Netanyahu's ministers attacking these families, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=324.0s)]
*  screaming at them, you don't have a monopoly on pain and this sort of thing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=329.0s)]
*  And I have to tell you that what, again, assuming this deal goes through, as you said, assuming it proceeds smoothly, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=333.0s)]
*  what we're talking about is the Israeli government within very few days finding itself in a squeeze organized by Hamas [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=339.0s)]
*  in which either it suspends military operations for longer or it has to look at close to 100 Israeli families in the face [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=347.0s)]
*  and say yeah, your loved ones are still in Gaza and we're starting to bomb again. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=356.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=360.0s)]
*  Noga Tarnopolski is always fantastic to get your perspective. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=362.0s)]
*  I really appreciate you staying up till this ungodly hour to bring us this news live here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=365.0s)]
*  It's really appreciated. Thank you very much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=370.0s)]
*  Here in the U.S., we have reached a landmark moment in the explicitly fascist unveiling of Donald Trump's reelection campaign. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=373.0s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, the paper of record, New York Times, all the news that fits the print, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=380.0s)]
*  used the F-word in a news article to describe the ex-president's rhetoric. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=384.0s)]
*  As Peace reports on the, quote, scholars, Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans were asking anew [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=390.0s)]
*  how much Mr. Trump resembles current strongmen abroad and how he compares to authoritarian leaders in the past. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=395.0s)]
*  Perhaps most urgently, they are wondering whether his rhetorical turn into more fascist-sounding territory [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=401.0s)]
*  is just his latest public provocation of the left and evolutionist beliefs or the dropping of a veil. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=407.0s)]
*  Good sentence. And to be clear, this is the correct, unavoidable assessment of Donald Trump's words and actions. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=413.0s)]
*  Fascist-sounding, that's good. That's a good description. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=421.0s)]
*  In recent weeks, he has compared his political opponents to vermin, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=424.0s)]
*  threatened to use the power of the state to prosecute his enemies. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=428.0s)]
*  He's publicly discussed plans to round up immigrants and concentrate them in camps and deport them by the millions. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=431.0s)]
*  And if the man doing all this wasn't also the man who launched a violent coup to state empower, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=439.0s)]
*  maybe you could dismiss it as a talk, but we all saw it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=444.0s)]
*  He already tried to topple American democracy, and he's going to try again. He keeps telling us. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=449.0s)]
*  That's the language and the behavior of fascism, maybe some different form of it, some 21st century American incarnation, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=455.0s)]
*  but it's related. It's always been there, but lately it's become even louder. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=464.0s)]
*  In this moment, the true menace of a fascist kind of movement in this country is becoming more and more apparent. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=471.0s)]
*  It's not just emanating from Donald Trump or his most devoted fans. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=479.0s)]
*  We see it in here in these sort of concentric circles emanating out from the ex-president. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=482.0s)]
*  Now, there's some people in Republican Party politics chiefly who just don't have the courage or the moral backbone or the sense or the wherewithal [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=488.0s)]
*  or even just the dignity of self to fight. They're just glumly resigned to it. It's pathetic, but that's how most of them are. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=496.0s)]
*  Some are actively pushing the fascist ideas in the hopes of executing them from positions of power in the new Trump administration. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=503.0s)]
*  Here's an example, sort of more or less at random, this dude, conservative lawyer Mike Davis. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=510.0s)]
*  He's got a resume that's like, you know, one in a hundred. You could find tons of guys like this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=515.0s)]
*  He helped confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. He served as chief counsel for nominations to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=521.0s)]
*  then chair of the Judiciary Committee. So this is a guy who was in charge of shepherding judicial nominations. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=527.0s)]
*  And he wants to be Donald Trump's next attorney general, and he is laying out his plans for a reign of terror in his own words [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=532.0s)]
*  when he gets there. During my three week reign of terror as Trump acting attorney general before I get chased out of town [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=539.0s)]
*  with my Trump pardon, I will reign hell on Washington, D.C. Number one, we're going to fire. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=549.0s)]
*  We're going to fire a lot of people in the executive branch of the deep state. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=555.0s)]
*  Number two, we're going to indict. We're going to indict Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and James Biden and every other scum ball, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=560.0s)]
*  sleazeball, biting. Number three, we're going to deport. We're going to deport a lot of people. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=566.0s)]
*  Ten million people when growing, anchor babies, their parents, the grandparents. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=572.0s)]
*  We're going to put kids in cages. It's going to be glorious. Anchor babies, by the way, that offensive term for American citizens. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=577.0s)]
*  Now, after my colleague, Mehdi Hassan, highlighted those threats in a segment over the weekend, Davis replied, quote, Mehdi Hassan is now on my list. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=585.0s)]
*  I already have his spot picked out in the D.C. gulag. Now, let me just stipulate. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=592.0s)]
*  This is almost like comically pathetic chest beating of a creepy dork. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=597.0s)]
*  But again, the history of fascism is kind of full of creepy dorks who came into power and then because they had spent their whole lives [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=603.0s)]
*  as sort of impending creepy dorks, then used the power of the state to execute their most despicable, violent fantasies. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=612.0s)]
*  All that like down the block toughness. All of a sudden they were then in charge. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=618.0s)]
*  Of course, that most recent threat against my friend and colleague Mehdi came on a platform owned by the wealthiest man in the world who perhaps you've been hearing some stuff about, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=622.0s)]
*  who has also clearly just aligned himself with this fascist tendency. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=633.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has welcomed back neo-Nazis who had been banned from the site now known as X. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=638.0s)]
*  He defended white supremacists, compared Jewish billionaire George Soros to a Jewish Marvel supervillain. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=643.0s)]
*  Just the other day, Musk endorsed the anti-Semitic Great Replacement conspiracy theory, beloved of creepy dorks on the right. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=649.0s)]
*  That's the one about a cabal of nefarious Jews colluding and sort of puppeteering minorities in order to extinguish white people. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=656.0s)]
*  It was the inspiration for the mass murder that happened to the Tree of Life synagogue. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=665.0s)]
*  Now, Musk has actual state power now on his side. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=669.0s)]
*  Yesterday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the guy who just managed to escape a impeachment, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=672.0s)]
*  announced an investigation into the Wachschau Group Media Matters in the wake of their report about ads from major brands appearing next to the pro-Nazi content on X. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=679.0s)]
*  That's what it looks like when people in power with state power abuse that power to persecute their political enemies. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=688.0s)]
*  And again, this is the message. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=696.0s)]
*  This is what they're running on. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=699.0s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump and his allies are promising to do over and over, like every second they're in front of a camera. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=701.0s)]
*  One of the most maddening features of this era is knowing that and watching this happen while polling suggests that most Americans don't care and Donald Trump supporters have not been swayed. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=709.0s)]
*  But I got to say, we do have some new data that sort of paints a different picture, courtesy of Nate Cohn and the New York Times. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=721.0s)]
*  Nate, who's very, very, very smart and runs a great polling operation in the New York Times, he tried this experiment in the polling they were doing to measure how much democracy matters to voters. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=728.0s)]
*  So when they asked undecided voters if they would support a Democratic candidate who says Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy or a Republican candidate who says we should move on from the 2020 election, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=740.0s)]
*  the Republican led by 15 points when they changed that question slightly to a Republican candidate who tried to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=749.0s)]
*  The hypothetical Democrat led by three points. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=758.0s)]
*  Coe concludes that voters may not say democracy is the most important issue, but there's strong evidence that they're repelled by anti-democracy candidates. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=761.0s)]
*  And again, this result isn't just some comforting abstraction. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=769.0s)]
*  We've got data on this in the real world. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=772.0s)]
*  It fits with recent election results where anti-democracy, fascist, sympathizing candidates have faced defeat after defeat. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=775.0s)]
*  Americans, by and large, maybe not by enormous margins, do in the main remain in favor of democracy. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=783.0s)]
*  That's cheering. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=792.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9dyuNEKsI&t=805.0s)]
