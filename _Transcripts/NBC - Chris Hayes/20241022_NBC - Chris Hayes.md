# Trump speaks like Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, says Pulitzer prize-winning historian
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc)
*  I think everyone's probably seen these images by now Donald Trump in a McDonald's apron, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=0.0s)]
*  bagging fries and handing out food at the drive-in window. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=4.16s)]
*  The whole episode perfectly captures something about Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=7.44s)]
*  I mean, campaign photo ops stunts are part of electoral politics everywhere, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=11.16s)]
*  Every day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=15.38s)]
*  But this entire thing was completely fabricated, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=16.38s)]
*  The McDonald's in Feasterville, Pennsylvania was closed to the public for the day, it was [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=20.6s)]
*  just a set for the day, to host a Republican presidential candidate. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=24.32s)]
*  And then the customers who went through the drive-through were like preselected by the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=27.56s)]
*  franchise and the local Trump campaign. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=31.16s)]
*  A person familiar with the event told NBC News. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=33.56s)]
*  It's also not true that all the burgers he handed out had already had a bite taken out [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=36.2s)]
*  of them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=40.12s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=41.12s)]
*  A lot like his stunt at the barber shop in my home borough of the Bronx last week, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=42.16s)]
*  There was a huge security tent outside blocking people from seeing inside. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=46.68s)]
*  Some of the people inside were Make Barbers Great Again shirts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  One guy said he'd never met the other people there before. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=55.0s)]
*  I think you could say here, collectively, I met all these guys today for the first time, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=57.88s)]
*  but we all love America just like you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=63.2s)]
*  And that's why we're here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=65.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=66.56s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=67.56s)]
*  Really nice. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=68.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=69.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=70.56s)]
*  Real natural. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=71.56s)]
*  Trump's regular guy, photo ops, they always have this sort of vaguely dear leader feel [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=72.56s)]
*  to it, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=75.44s)]
*  Like this image making the rounds on the internet of a shirtless Benito Mussolini, former fascist [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=76.44s)]
*  dictator in Italy, threshing wheat in the 1930s. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=81.16s)]
*  Like doing his version of 1930s McDonald's. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=84.16s)]
*  Exact same campy uncanniness as Trump in a McDonald's and a Bronx barber shop. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=88.96s)]
*  It's not the only thing Trump has in common with some of the worst figures in history. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=94.32s)]
*  As Ann Applebaum points out in The Atlantic, by using terms like the enemy within and calling [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=99.08s)]
*  immigrants vermin or poison the blood, Trump knows exactly what he's doing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=103.0s)]
*  He understands which era and what kind of politics this language evokes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=106.8s)]
*  Ann Applebaum, Pulitzer Prize winner and historian, staff writer for The Atlantic, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=111.04s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  Ann I like the piece you wrote because it's very historically grounded and I do think [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=116.12s)]
*  there's been this debate about the appropriateness of that term as applied to Donald Trump, the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=119.56s)]
*  uniqueness of American historical development, blah blah blah blah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=124.48s)]
*  Why does it matter to you in some ways that the language he's using connects so clearly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=128.86s)]
*  to some of the worst people in human history? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=134.62s)]
*  First of all, I think it's important that people know this is not normal language. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=140.96s)]
*  It hasn't been used before in American politics, not in presidential politics or mainstream [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=144.72s)]
*  politics. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=149.44s)]
*  Calling your political opponents the enemies within or using terms like vermin or cold [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=152.44s)]
*  blooded killers to describe people you don't like. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=159.12s)]
*  Some of the language, as I said, is borrowed directly from, it's funny, I mean, it's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=164.34s)]
*  not just people keep talking about Hitler or Mussolini, but actually Stalin used language [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  like that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  Mao used language like that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  East German Stasi used language like that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  And they did it for a reason. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=178.12s)]
*  They did it because they were trying to dehumanize their political enemies to say these people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=179.58s)]
*  don't count. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=186.52s)]
*  You don't have to think about them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=187.52s)]
*  You can do what you want to them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=188.52s)]
*  You can commit violence against them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=190.56s)]
*  They don't have any rights. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  They aren't, you know, they're not even, they're not human beings. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  They're not citizens. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=195.8s)]
*  I think he's evoking that idea of violence. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=198.52s)]
*  I mean, he also does it by talking vaguely about letting the police do whatever they [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=201.24s)]
*  want for one day or being a dictator for one day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=204.8s)]
*  He's sort of implying the use of violence. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=208.36s)]
*  And I think he's doing it on purpose to excite a part of the electorate that likes that language. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=211.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's pretty hard for some people to accept. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=217.08s)]
*  But I think it's important that we understand what he's doing because he seems to know what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=220.2s)]
*  he's doing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=223.36s)]
*  What I think is important about that, and I've been really thinking a lot about this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  recently into the wee hours of the morning, in bed without sleeping, that there's a certain [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=228.24s)]
*  degree to which you can say this, this sorts of language can be quite effective. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, it has an effectiveness in that the degree to which there's a kind of like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  tacit or even explicit essentially elite prohibition on it, or that the sort of contestants for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=243.96s)]
*  power are like, we don't say things like that because it's wrong, ends up being a kind of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=249.52s)]
*  gargoyle that has been blown past. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=254.04s)]
*  And the question is whether you can, you know, just how effective it is when sort of presented [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=257.28s)]
*  to the electorate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=262.12s)]
*  No, I mean, I mean, look, it was effective in the 1930s. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=263.12s)]
*  It's been effective since then. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=267.2s)]
*  It destroys taboos. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=269.56s)]
*  It makes people feel like they've entered a new era. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=271.56s)]
*  Things are are possible. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=274.48s)]
*  You know, they might be, you know, it implies if you're on his side, it implies you're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  part of some kind of tough, winning, powerful movement that will destroy the unimportant [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=282.72s)]
*  enemies. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=289.72s)]
*  You know, you'll you know, you're part of a mass movement. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=290.72s)]
*  And that's something that's always appealed to human beings. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  It's funny, I've actually just returned from Germany today and there I was repeatedly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=295.24s)]
*  asked about this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  And people would say to me, well, how is it possible that Americans are attracted to this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=300.12s)]
*  kind of language? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=304.32000000000005s)]
*  And I would look at my interlocutors and I'm saying from your history, you don't know. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's it's happened before. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not one of the things I think one of the reasons it works is because it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=313.44s)]
*  is not shtick. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=316.8s)]
*  It is partly shtick, but also genuinely held. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=317.88s)]
*  I mean, here's here's John Kelly talking about Trump and Hitler, literally. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=322.0s)]
*  Here's what he had to say about recalling conversations with Donald Trump, former chief [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=327.0s)]
*  of staff, the president, who who who admired certain aspects of Hitler, saying he [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=331.36s)]
*  commented more than once, you know, Hitler did some good things, too. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=336.56s)]
*  And of course, in history, again, I think he's lacking in that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=339.04s)]
*  But if you know Hitler was all about, you'd be pretty hard to make an argument. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=341.8s)]
*  He did anything good. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=344.6s)]
*  He talked about wanting to have generals like Hitler's generals, which, again, not really [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=346.16s)]
*  understanding the full story there of Hitler's generals. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=349.88s)]
*  But I do think this desire for essentially absolute power, building the cult of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=352.36s)]
*  personality, part of its effectiveness is that it's a genuine aspiration of his. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=358.64s)]
*  No, it's and this is the thing that he has in common with autocrats around the world [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=363.56s)]
*  as he wants to rule without any checks and balances, without any norms, without any [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=367.48s)]
*  guardrails, without independent courts, without independent media. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=372.36s)]
*  And people like him in other countries have once they took power, once they've used that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=376.52s)]
*  kind of language to win elections legitimately, have often begun to then take apart their [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=382.64s)]
*  democratic systems. And of course, that's the threat of Trump, not that he's going to be [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=388.48s)]
*  Hitler. You know, that's a that's a that's a or that you don't imagine a Nazi movie. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=392.6s)]
*  Imagine rather the slow dismantling of institutions, the use of the IRS or the Department of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=398.32s)]
*  Justice against Trump's political enemies or against media he doesn't like. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that people who use this language have have have been doing, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=410.04s)]
*  whether in Hungary or in Turkey or a decade ago in Russia. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=415.2s)]
*  And when Trump says that he admires Putin or he admires she or he admires Viktor Orban, I think [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=419.56s)]
*  that's what he admires. They don't have to worry about these rules and norms and laws and the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=425.32s)]
*  Constitution. I saw Kelly saying in several different places, you know, in The Atlantic as [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=430.76s)]
*  well as the New York Times, I saw him saying, you know, I kept telling President Trump that I [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=438.28s)]
*  sworn oath to the Constitution, that my my loyalty is the Constitution, not to him personally. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=445.32s)]
*  You know, I'm loyal to the office of the president, not to Donald Trump. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=450.36s)]
*  And he found that impossible to understand because, you know, that's not that's not part of the way he [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  thinks about the world. And Applebaum, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmmxaCU2-Lc&t=457.96000000000004s)]
