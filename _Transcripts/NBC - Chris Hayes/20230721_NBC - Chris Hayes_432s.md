Video Description: Donald Trump has received a trial date in the federal documents case. Ali Velshi breaks down the timeline and what to expect in 2024. “The ex-President will be forced to sit before a federal judge – and a jury of his peers – as they consider whether or not he is guilty of a sprawling 37-count indictment. This news is not great for the Republican frontrunner because that date – May 20th, 2024 – is right smack in the middle of the primary season.”

# Trump to face federal trial May 20, 2024 in documents case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4)
*  As the voting is underway to determine the Republican nominee for president in 2024, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to be on trial. Just today, we learned that the ex-president must appear in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=6.08s)]
*  court on May the 20th, 2024, in Fort Pierce, Florida, for the start of his first federal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=11.52s)]
*  criminal trial in the classified documents case. Donald Trump will be tried on 37 counts, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=18.48s)]
*  with charges ranging from conspiracy to obstruct justice to willful retention [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  of government documents and making false statements. That ruling came today from the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=29.12s)]
*  Trump-appointed judge, Aileen Cannon. It was the first test that she has faced as to whether or [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=34.24s)]
*  not she would be impartial to the ex-president. There were valid concerns that she would be lenient [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=39.84s)]
*  with him, given a past ruling related to this very case. While the special counsel's team wanted a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=46.24s)]
*  speedy trial to start in December, Trump wanted to postpone the entire trial until after the election, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=51.36s)]
*  postpone it indefinitely. Imagine his willingness to be tried if he were to become president of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=57.6s)]
*  the United States again. Because Trump argued there was no way he could receive a fair trial [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=62.4s)]
*  while running for president. That argument was just part of the ex-president's broader scheme [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  to avoid facing justice or potentially jail time. Today, Judge Cannon split the difference. She said [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=72.08s)]
*  the amount of evidence and discovery in the case warranted a trial date several months down the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=79.6s)]
*  line from December. So the ex-president will be forced to sit before a federal jury and a jury of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=84.8s)]
*  his peers as they consider whether or not he is guilty of a sprawling 37-count indictment. This [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=90.8s)]
*  news is not great for the Republican front-runner because that date, May 20th, 2024, is right smack [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=97.52s)]
*  in the middle of the primary season. I'm going to take you down a little walk here with the calendar. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=104.24s)]
*  January 15th kicks off the primary season. Those are the Iowa caucuses. March 5th is Super Tuesday, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=109.44s)]
*  a whole bunch of states vote on March 5th. But come March, the ex-president has more to worry [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  about than just primaries because 20 days later, he's due in Manhattan, March 25th, to face trial [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  in what prosecutors say was an illegal hush money scheme that he orchestrated during the 2016 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=128.88s)]
*  campaign. And since this March 25th trial is a criminal trial, he has to physically be in court [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=134.08s)]
*  rather than campaigning. He'll be forced to sit down and listen to how prosecutors lay out the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=142.0s)]
*  evidence against him. Eight days after that, come April, there are a slew of primaries in Delaware, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. And less than a week before his federal trial is set to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=153.68s)]
*  start in Florida, and he's going to have to be looking through papers and documents, there are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=158.8s)]
*  contests in Maryland and Nebraska and West Virginia. That's May 14th. Then May 20th, Trump [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=162.72s)]
*  takes a break from the campaign trail for roughly two weeks, not by choice, but by the order of law. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=169.04s)]
*  He will have to listen to federal prosecutors make their case to the jury. And the start of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=174.72s)]
*  trial is just one day before Kentucky and Oregon hold their primaries. And even if that trial date [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=179.44s)]
*  sticks, right at the end of it, there will be more primaries in Washington, D.C., in Montana, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=185.36s)]
*  New Jersey, in New Mexico, and in South Dakota. July 15th will be the Republican National Convention [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=190.08s)]
*  in Milwaukee, at which point there's a possibility that Donald Trump will be a twice-convicted [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=197.12s)]
*  felon. We don't know. Now, take a look at this. This is a broader look at what Trump's legal woes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  look like. He's going to face a handful of civil lawsuits this fall and early next year. While those [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=208.24s)]
*  civil suits are sure to cause a headache for him, the ex-president is not required to be in court for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=213.12s)]
*  those trials. They're not criminal trials. He doesn't have to be there. The implication of Trump's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=219.2s)]
*  May 2024 trial date are interesting. Last time we had broad primaries, Joe Biden clinched the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  Democratic nomination on April the 8th when Bernie Sanders dropped out. In 2016, Donald Trump became [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  the Republican nominee on May 3rd when Ted Cruz dropped out. Barack Obama, 2008, he officially got [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=235.28s)]
*  his name on the ticket on June 3rd. In the year 2000, George W. Bush secured the Republican [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=241.44s)]
*  nomination on March the 9th when John McCain dropped out. Bill Clinton became the Democratic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=247.52s)]
*  nominee in 1992 when he secured the number of delegates he needed on June the 2nd. So there's a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=253.36s)]
*  good chance Donald Trump might be trying to secure the Republican nomination as he sits for his [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=259.12s)]
*  federal trial. And then there's the possibility that Trump could face two more indictments. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=263.6s)]
*  There's Jack Smith's 2020 election probe where we learn this week that Trump is officially a target [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=269.76s)]
*  of that criminal investigation. He was officially warned this week that he could face an indictment [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=274.4s)]
*  in that case for his efforts to subvert democracy. And we've got brand new developments out of Georgia [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  conducted by Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis that we're going to get to next [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  in this show. But in the midst of all this chaos, the ex-president has warned us what he's going to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=291.28s)]
*  do over and over again if he wins again. Just this weekend, Trump went out of his way to sing the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=296.4s)]
*  praises of Judge Aileen Cannon as he waited to see if she would rule in his favor and delay the trial. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=301.36s)]
*  Do you have any indication the judge will grant this motion? I don't know. I know it's a very [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=308.0s)]
*  highly respected judge, a very smart judge, and a very strong judge. But you appointed her. I did, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=312.48s)]
*  and I'm very proud to have appointed her, but she's very smart and very strong and loves our country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=317.2s)]
*  I mean, loves our country. We need judges that love our country so they do the right thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=324.16s)]
*  So they do the right thing. That pressure, that strategy apparently did not work, but the ex-president [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=329.2s)]
*  is warning everybody literally about everything. Just yesterday, he posted an ominous video with [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  the caption, quote, we aren't afraid of them. If you f*** around with us, if you do something bad to us, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=342.0s)]
*  we are going to do things to you that have never been done before. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=349.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is running for the presidency of the United States as the evil villain, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  and he's telling us exactly what he will do if things don't go his way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  News media and we will liberate America from these villains once and for all. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=383.6s)]
*  This is some weird stuff. So as we wait to see if Trump will get a second indictment from Jack [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=391.36s)]
*  Smith over Trump's scheme to subvert democracy, the question is will he ever be held to account? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  The only real way to stop this guy who is actually running as the evil villain [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=402.32000000000005s)]
*  from becoming the actual evil villain seems to be prosecution. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJSzcNQLVU4&t=406.96000000000004s)]
