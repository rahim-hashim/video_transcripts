# 'Utter disrespect': Sen. Blumenthal rips Justice Alito's 'bias' after flag scandal
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g)
*  Senator Richard Blumenthal, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrat of Connecticut, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=1.7s)]
*  sits on the Senate Judiciary [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=4.1s)]
*  Senator, thank you for taking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=5.9s)]
*  the time to be with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=7.54s)]
*  You have heard the story. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  You've heard Alito's response. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=9.94s)]
*  Your initial reaction? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=11.38s)]
*  My reaction is there is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=14.08s)]
*  absolutely no way that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=15.48s)]
*  Justice Alito can sit in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=17.92s)]
*  judgment on the two cases [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=21.06s)]
*  where Donald Trump's interests [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=23.56s)]
*  and the insurrection itself [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=25.36s)]
*  is directly involved. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=28.12s)]
*  He has disgracefully and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=29.1s)]
*  shamefully displayed the flag [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=30.8s)]
*  in utter disrespect, but even [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=34.5s)]
*  more, he has shown his bias [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=37.1s)]
*  when it comes to those cases. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=40.44s)]
*  In another era, there would be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  absolutely no question about [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  the need to question his [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=48.92s)]
*  resignation, but this court has [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=50.32s)]
*  been so disrespectful of basic [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=52.66s)]
*  standards of decency that it may [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=55.46s)]
*  well kind of be taken for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=58.2s)]
*  granted. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=60.74s)]
*  But here is the simple truth. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=61.5s)]
*  He owes the American people in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  the Congress an explanation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  It may well be there needs to be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=67.0s)]
*  a hearing about how this kind of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=68.38s)]
*  disrespectful display of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  flag occurred, and without [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  question, he needs to recuse [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  himself from those cases, step [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=79.16s)]
*  aside on all the cases that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=81.56s)]
*  involve Donald Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Can I ask you, Senator, do you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=85.92s)]
*  have a sense of the pressure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=87.28s)]
*  points that would actually get [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Alito or Thomas to recuse [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  themselves? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  The pressure point is the chief [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=95.7s)]
*  justice of the Supreme Court, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  and it's now time for Justice [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Roberts to lead, to demonstrate [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=104.14s)]
*  spine and backbone, to call for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=106.7s)]
*  his colleague to step aside from [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=109.94s)]
*  these cases, and it ought to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  apply probably to Justice Thomas [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  That's one pressure point. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=116.4s)]
*  Another one is my Republican [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  colleagues ought to be joining [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=119.7s)]
*  in calling for a code of ethics, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  not the set of vague rules and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=124.0s)]
*  principles that the court has [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=126.94s)]
*  articulated, but a really [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=128.34s)]
*  enforceable code of ethics with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=130.28s)]
*  teeth that would apply to this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  kind of disrespectful, indecent [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=134.58s)]
*  behavior. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=138.38s)]
*  And third, we need an inspector [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=138.88s)]
*  general for the judicial branch, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=140.82s)]
*  as well as most particularly for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=143.2s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=145.12s)]
*  I'm very clear-eyed about the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=146.96s)]
*  likelihood of any of those [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  measures taking place in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Congress because Republicans [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  have simply abandoned their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=155.66s)]
*  sense of ethical standards, and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=158.14s)]
*  I think we have to put the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=162.14s)]
*  Supreme Court and the judiciary [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=163.6s)]
*  on the ballot as an issue going [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=165.84s)]
*  into these coming elections and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=168.54s)]
*  really tell the American people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=172.18s)]
*  they have a choice to make [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  between candidates who say [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=175.24s)]
*  they're going to stand up for [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  ethical conduct and others who [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  try to walk away from it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  Senator, I hear you on the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=183.18s)]
*  ballot box at the same time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  I do wonder if the Senate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=185.88s)]
*  Judiciary Committee should [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=187.22s)]
*  investigate any of these claims. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  I believe we should. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=192.72s)]
*  I think we should investigate [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=194.26000000000002s)]
*  Justice Thomas' violations of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=195.5s)]
*  basic standards of ethics, and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=198.9s)]
*  I think that Justice Alito has [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=200.9s)]
*  committed very similar actions, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=203.62s)]
*  and this latest is just one more [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=205.7s)]
*  that cries out for accountability. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=208.2s)]
*  Remember, the Supreme Court [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=210.26s)]
*  consists of nine members of a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  judicial branch that is seemingly [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=215.73999999999998s)]
*  above the law. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=218.44s)]
*  The highest court in the land [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=219.6s)]
*  has the lowest or no real [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=220.88s)]
*  enforceable standards of ethics, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=223.84s)]
*  and the only way to hold them [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=226.68s)]
*  accountable to the minimal [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=228.42s)]
*  standards of conduct are to have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  a hearing in the judiciary, and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  I think it's the Judiciary [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=236.28s)]
*  Committee that ought to be doing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=238.94s)]
*  it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Listen, anyone who cares about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=240.38s)]
*  democracy ought to care about [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=241.84s)]
*  this institution, and yet I [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=244.02s)]
*  appreciate and understand that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  this can all seem a little [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  esoteric to some folks in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=248.88s)]
*  context of the decisions that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=250.66s)]
*  the court is going to be making [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=253.02s)]
*  just in the next few weeks, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=254.32s)]
*  months. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=255.96s)]
*  Can you explain to American [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=256.66s)]
*  voters why this matters? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=258.06s)]
*  What matters is that the United [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=260.66s)]
*  States Supreme Court is slow [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=262.66s)]
*  walking a decision that is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=264.3s)]
*  critical to the prosecution of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=265.56s)]
*  Donald Trump in federal court. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=267.6s)]
*  Second, it will soon decide [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=269.8s)]
*  cases that are critical legally [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=272.5s)]
*  to the key questions at stake in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=276.14s)]
*  the prosecution of the January [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=280.24s)]
*  6th insurrectionists, whether [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=282.14s)]
*  they can be held accountable [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=284.18s)]
*  under a particular federal [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=286.48s)]
*  statute that could also [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=287.82s)]
*  be applied to Donald Trump. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=289.7s)]
*  And second, whether Donald [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=291.14s)]
*  Trump should be given blanket [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  immunity for almost anything he [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=294.58s)]

*  This Supreme Court will answer [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=312.66s)]
*  to no one for those decisions. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=315.66s)]
*  Two members of this court and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=318.72s)]
*  maybe more have demonstrated [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=320.12s)]
*  their bias, and that is exactly [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  why they need to step aside, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=325.52s)]
*  Justices Thomas and Alito. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=327.52s)]
*  And there's one more point here, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=330.62s)]
*  which is that, you know, the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=332.62s)]
*  Supreme Court is taking down [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=335.36s)]
*  through these self-inflicted [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=338.22s)]
*  wounds, not just the fairness in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=339.7s)]
*  individual cases, but the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=342.96s)]
*  institution itself. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=344.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court has no armies [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=346.72s)]
*  or police force to enforce its [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=349.16s)]
*  orders or rulings. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=351.72s)]
*  It has only the trust and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  credibility of the American [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=355.92s)]
*  people, which it is destroying. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=356.82000000000005s)]
*  Its approvals are plummeting, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  and with good reason, because it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=362.72s)]
*  has squandered its trust. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=364.72s)]
*  Senator Richard Blumenthal, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=368.06s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=369.62s)]
*  being with us. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=371.06s)]
*  For more, let's talk with [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=372.66s)]
*  Melissa Marais. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  She's a professor of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=374.22s)]
*  constitutional law at New York [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  University. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=376.32s)]
*  She also clerked for Justice [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=376.94s)]
*  Sonia Sotomayor when she was on [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=378.12s)]
*  the U.S. Court of Appeals for [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  the Second Circuit, and she is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=380.88s)]
*  the co-host of the Strict [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=382.58s)]
*  Scrutiny Podcast, and I have the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=384.28s)]
*  benefit of seeing you in my [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=385.64s)]
*  peripheral vision as the senator [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=386.98s)]
*  is talking. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=388.54s)]
*  So, your thoughts on what you [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=389.14s)]
*  just heard. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=390.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think the senator is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=390.78s)]
*  exactly right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=391.88s)]
*  Obviously, there needs to be [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=392.52s)]
*  accountability here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=393.68s)]
*  There has needed to be [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=394.48s)]
*  accountability for some time, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=395.62s)]
*  but the accountability has to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=396.84s)]
*  come from the court, and this is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=397.92s)]
*  a court that, you know, in bravo [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=399.34s)]
*  TV terms, is basically like, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  who going to check me, boo? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=402.34s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=403.64s)]
*  Nobody's going to check this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=404.32s)]
*  court. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=405.52s)]
*  This court is on its own steam, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=405.78s)]
*  high on its own supply, and it's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=407.88s)]
*  doing what it wants. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=409.29999999999995s)]
*  And, I mean, Justice Alito [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=410.38s)]
*  basically told us where his [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=413.0s)]
*  political allegiances lie. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  Like, he and his wife were [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=416.78s)]
*  apparently so perturbed by this [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=418.17999999999995s)]
*  anti-Trump display that they [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=420.5s)]
*  felt free to fly the American [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=421.97999999999996s)]
*  flag upside down. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, that by itself, I think, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=425.08s)]
*  is notable. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=426.88s)]
*  If you didn't know for the past [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=427.73999999999995s)]
*  eight years where Justice Alito [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=429.29999999999995s)]
*  was on the political spectrum, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=430.78s)]
*  now you know he's very firmly in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  the Trump camp. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=434.08s)]
*  So is his wife, and they're [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  flying the flag upside down, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  the symbol of Stop the Seal. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=437.76s)]
*  And his statement to the press [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=439.42s)]
*  did not dispute any of this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=441.52s)]
*  He didn't say, like, I didn't [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=443.3s)]
*  fly the flag. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=444.7s)]
*  He didn't say, I don't know what [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=445.42s)]
*  it means to fly a flag upside [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=447.0s)]
*  down. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=448.5s)]
*  Instead, he's just like, we did [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=448.9s)]
*  it to own the lives, or rather, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=450.52s)]
*  my wife did it to own the lives, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  which raises a whole separate [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=454.02s)]
*  set of questions. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=455.5s)]
*  Justice Alito is the author of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=456.32s)]
*  the Dobs' opinion which withdrew [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=457.9s)]
*  the right to an abortion from [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=459.52s)]
*  millions of women in America. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=461.12s)]
*  For someone who is so intent on [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=463.34s)]
*  controlling American women, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=465.62s)]
*  Justice Thomas and Justice Alito [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  seem to have no responsibility [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=469.74s)]
*  for controlling what their wives [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  do on their own time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  And again, it's not a feminist [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=475.38s)]
*  message I'm trying to send here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=477.12s)]
*  But before you come at everyone [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=478.52s)]
*  else's cervix, maybe get your [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=481.38s)]
*  own house in order. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=483.08s)]
*  This is an optical disaster for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  you, for the court. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=486.52s)]
*  If this is your wife's doing, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=488.08s)]
*  maybe she shouldn't be doing it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=489.53999999999996s)]
*  One of the things, just to pick [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=490.78s)]
*  up on the fact, as you said, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=491.82s)]
*  that this was the message that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=493.68s)]
*  they came forward with, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=494.78s)]
*  So there's the response. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=496.02s)]
*  The Times has the reporting. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=496.98s)]
*  They respond to Times. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=498.48s)]
*  This is a terrible response, FYI. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=499.48s)]
*  But then they go a step further [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=501.78s)]
*  with Fox News. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=503.28s)]
*  So this was Fox News anchor [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=504.08s)]
*  Shannon Bream, who apparently [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=507.18s)]
*  was told by Justice Alito, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  he told me, a neighbor on their [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=512.08s)]
*  street had an F Trump sign that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=513.72s)]
*  was within 50 feet of where [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=515.74s)]
*  children await the school bus in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=517.22s)]
*  January 21. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=519.02s)]
*  Mrs. Alito brought this up with [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=520.64s)]
*  the neighbor, which at the time, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=522.42s)]
*  it seems Fairfax schools were [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=524.22s)]
*  remote, so there were likely no [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=525.88s)]
*  children on buses. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=528.18s)]
*  But the fact that he chose us to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=528.88s)]
*  go to a conservative media [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=530.08s)]
*  outlet to expand his story, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=531.38s)]
*  this is not the first time he's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=534.68s)]
*  done this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=535.62s)]
*  No, this is not the first time [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=535.82s)]
*  he has gone to a conservative [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=536.92s)]
*  media outlet. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=538.24s)]
*  He's been to the Wall Street [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=538.88s)]
*  Journal many times to state his [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=539.72s)]
*  views on his views that the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1csmMJkw1g&t=541.52s)]
