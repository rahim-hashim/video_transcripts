# ‘Parroting Donald’ Michael Cohen on why Trump’s ‘belligerent’ lawyers sound like him
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas)
*  That was how Ivanka Trump, former senior White House advisor, former executive vice president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=0.0s)]
*  of development and acquisitions of the Trump Organization, and daughter of Donald Trump [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=18.46s)]
*  was greeted as she entered a downtown Manhattan courthouse this morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=21.98s)]
*  Donald Trump's eldest daughter is the fourth and final member of her family to testify [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=25.86s)]
*  in the $250 million civil fraud trial against her father and his business. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=30.78s)]
*  Now Ivanka Trump, unlike her brothers, is not a defendant, and that's due to the statute [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=35.379999999999995s)]
*  of limitations, and she took the stand today as a reluctant witness for the New York attorney [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=39.7s)]
*  general. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  Michael Cohen worked as Donald Trump's personal lawyer and self-described fixer for a decade [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=45.18s)]
*  before going to prison for taking part in a legal hush money scheme Trump was indicted [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  for earlier this year, separate from his civil fraud lawsuit. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=53.7s)]
*  Cohen is the host of the May I Call to Podcast, co-host of the political beatdown podcast, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  author of Revenge, How Donald Trump Weaponized the U.S. Department of Justice Against its [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  Critics, and he joins me now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  Let's start first, Michael, with Ivanka Trump's role in the family business. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  She, because of statute of limitations, is not in the same boat as her brothers. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=73.66s)]
*  Can you describe her level, where she fit in the sort of org chart to the extent there [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=79.64s)]
*  was one? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, there definitely was. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Of course, Donald was the absolute top of the org chart. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=87.2s)]
*  And then, of course, to the left of that, if we were putting this into a diagram, would [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=92.28s)]
*  be Don, Ivanka, and Eric. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=96.8s)]
*  Now who really ran that specific group as part of the executive vice president? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=99.52s)]
*  And that would be Ivanka. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=105.52s)]
*  Don, even though older than Ivanka, would take a lot of direction from her, because, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=108.0s)]
*  as everybody would acknowledge, she is Donald's favorite. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=115.32s)]
*  And then, of course, Eric, being the youngest, would, of course, listen as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=119.88s)]
*  But the three of them, Don, Ivanka, and Eric, each and every week would have their own private [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  family meeting where they would distribute which projects each one would do and in what [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=132.23999999999998s)]
*  aspect that they would be involved. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=139.72s)]
*  Now one of the, I should say two of the issues that were brought up on trial today, and she [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=141.84s)]
*  was questioned on the stand, was, of course, the old post office and the Doral Golf Resort, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=149.16s)]
*  both of which Ivanka was the point person on. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=155.48s)]
*  And both of those are involved in Tish James' questioning, or I should say the prosecutors [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  on behalf of Tish James' questioning. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=165.14s)]
*  So she is as high up as anybody could be, but just slightly below her father. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=168.04s)]
*  Do you, there has been sort of after the January 6th, the White House, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=175.04s)]
*  What appears to be a transparent attempt to distance herself from her father, I don't [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=180.86s)]
*  think it's particularly successful because everyone knows who she is, that seems different [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=185.08s)]
*  than the brothers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=190.68s)]
*  Is that a fair read? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=191.68s)]
*  Yeah, that is definitely a fair read. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=193.24s)]
*  I'll tell you what else is a fair read is that the sketch artist certainly did a better [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=195.72000000000003s)]
*  job on Ivanka and Don and Eric, even Donald than she did on me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=199.28s)]
*  But putting that aside, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know who she was drawing when she was drawing me, but putting that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  aside, yes, yes, absolutely. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=212.4s)]
*  First of all, she's trying to distance herself because it's not the look that she wants to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=216.0s)]
*  portray, not certainly in Indian Creek there in Miami where they're having a very rough [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  time in terms of meeting people, setting up play dates for their kids, getting into the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  country clubs that she thought that she would be easily admitted to. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=232.88s)]
*  There's a section, one of the things that's happening here, and I think you have unique [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=238.84s)]
*  insight to share is the approach of the lawyers here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=243.12s)]
*  Now, these are, you know, Chris Kye is a serious lawyer with a serious resume, and he's done [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=245.8s)]
*  this before. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=249.72s)]
*  There has been a lot of combatedness by this legal team towards the judge today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=251.12s)]
*  Again, once again, going back and forth on a regional little piece from the NBC News [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=256.12s)]
*  reporting on this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  This is the lawyer Chris Kye saying that the questions about Ivanka's endowment in that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=263.64s)]
*  deal you just mentioned, that's the old post office in Washington, D.C. in a hotel, were [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=266.96s)]
*  irrelevant because of the statute of limitations issue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=271.4s)]
*  Note that the government agency involved in the talks was happy with it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=272.96s)]
*  They were thrilled with the renovation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=276.44s)]
*  It was a world-class facility, he said, and the judge, Ongoran, replied, you're starting [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=277.84s)]
*  to sound like your client. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=281.88s)]
*  Why does everyone who works for him start sounding like him no matter what they sounded [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=283.44s)]
*  like before? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=288.88s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=289.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's not weird. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=290.88s)]
*  It's actually part of the job. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=292.88s)]
*  He tells you what he wants you to say. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=295.18s)]
*  It's not as if Chris Kyes came up with this on his own. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=298.32s)]
*  There are talking points. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=301.6s)]
*  And if you don't hit the talking points that Donald wants, you're fired. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=303.12s)]
*  That's exactly what Chris Kyes is doing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  But he's not the only belligerent lawyer on behalf of Donald. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=310.48s)]
*  You also have Alina Haber, who, of course, the second that she gets an opportunity to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  be in front of a microphone and a camera, she's parroting Donald as if she is Donald, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=319.88s)]
*  which is great. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=326.92s)]
*  But the only thing that she didn't say, today she came out once again attacking me, as if [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=328.8s)]
*  that's going to be the end-all, be-all, as others have called it, the Perry-Mason moment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  The case is over because she tries to disparage me. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=339.04s)]
*  It's like Alina Haber's looking for the case of the missing pillowcase. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=344.0s)]
*  It just doesn't do anything for this specific, other than embarrass herself, embarrass her [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=349.04s)]
*  client and sort of make a mockery of the whole proceeding. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=354.12s)]
*  I want to ask you a question that's parallel to this, because it's about something I just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=358.16s)]
*  talked to Eric Holder about, and you talked about this before, which is the sort of vision [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=362.12s)]
*  to fully sort of bring the Department of Justice into the orbit of the president and be used [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=367.44s)]
*  it as fully an instrument of political retribution or reward by the sitting president. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  To the extent there are examples of that, and there clearly are, right, where Trump [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=378.2s)]
*  was ordering Jeff Sessions to do things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=382.04s)]
*  The one clearest-cut example seems to be him intervening and Bill Barr intervening specifically [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=384.48s)]
*  in your case before DOJ, specifically about whether you're on release. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=391.4s)]
*  You basically experience the small version of what he's promising for the rest of the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=396.56s)]
*  country. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=400.12s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if I would call it small. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=401.12s)]
*  I was unconstitutionally remanded back to Otisville because I refused to waive my First [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=403.48s)]
*  Amendment constitutional right in a document that they wanted me to sign that was prepared [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  specifically for me. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=416.42s)]
*  In fact, the case is on appeal December 14th at the courthouse, the Thurgood Marshall [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  appellate courthouse in New York, where we certainly expect I am, and Donald made me [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=423.38s)]
*  the very first political prisoner held by this country for failing to waive a First [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=429.62s)]
*  Amendment constitutional right. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=435.14s)]
*  Now, let me be very clear about something. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=437.1s)]
*  I won't be the last if, in fact, he gets into office. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=440.06s)]
*  I will just be the first. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=443.86s)]
*  And he is—don't take it from me. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=445.98s)]
*  Listen to what Donald is telling you that he's going to do. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=449.86s)]
*  The first thing he said, he's going to rewrite the Constitution. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  He's going to strip the legislature and the judiciary of their tripartite power and confer [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=455.86s)]
*  everything to the executive branch, which is who? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=463.98s)]
*  It's him. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=467.82s)]
*  And he will come after everyone, including yourself, Chris. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=468.82s)]
*  Anyone that angered him, anyone that bothered him, I'm going to go for my retribution. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=472.70000000000005s)]
*  That's all he's saying. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=479.06s)]
*  Don't take my word. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=480.3s)]
*  Listen. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=481.3s)]
*  Listen to what he's saying. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=482.3s)]
*  He's promising. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=483.3s)]
*  Whether it can deliver, I don't know, but he's definitely promising it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=484.3s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  I think the Department of Justice is a fulcrum that is much more easily wielded than a constitutional [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=486.78000000000003s)]
*  rewrite. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY8Kz6oGRas&t=492.22s)]
