# Bible flagged under new book ban law pushed by Republicans in Utah
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc)
*  There's a meme I've been thinking about a lot lately, a viral tweet that reads, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=0.0s)]
*  I quote, I never thought leopards would eat my face, Sobs woman who voted for the leopards [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=6.0s)]
*  eating people's faces party. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=11.32s)]
*  It's an adage that has been proven relevant, excuse me, time and again, when the American [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=13.58s)]
*  right is forced to reckon with the consequences of its own actions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=18.06s)]
*  Most recently in Utah, where Republicans passed a law targeting books in school libraries [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=21.56s)]
*  that contain quote, pornographic or indecent content. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  And wouldn't you know it, that very law, that very law has now been used to restrict access [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=29.3s)]
*  to, wait for it, the Bible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=33.7s)]
*  With the holy book in one hand and signs in the other, frustrated parents calling out [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=38.2s)]
*  the recent decision by Davis School District that voted to remove the King James version [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=42.7s)]
*  of the Bible from elementary and middle school libraries. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=47.06s)]
*  The move coming after a complaint was filed with the district in December, when the district [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  received an anonymous grievance that said the school district was ignoring quote, one [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=57.88s)]
*  of the most sex written books around the Bible, adding that this edition of the Bible quote, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  has no serious values for minors because it's pornographic by our new definition. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=67.92s)]
*  Get this porn out of our schools. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  So maybe it's time to update that meme. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=77.76s)]
*  I never thought they would ban my favorite book, Sobs woman who voted for the book banning [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=80.2s)]
*  party. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=84.84s)]
*  State Representative Carol Spackman Moss is a Democratic member of the Utah State House [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=86.64s)]
*  before running for office. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=90.28s)]
*  She was a high school teacher for more than 30 years and she joins me now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=91.28s)]
*  Representative Moss, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=95.72s)]
*  What is your reaction to the King James Bible being taken out of some Utah school libraries? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=97.24s)]
*  Do you support that move on the basis of, I don't know, consistency if Republicans are [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=102.16s)]
*  going to ban books with vulgarity or sex in them? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=106.44s)]
*  And that includes the Bible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=109.04s)]
*  Yes, it was consistent. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=110.64s)]
*  And by the way, I was an English teacher. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=112.4s)]
*  I taught literature and writing and I sometimes taught a unit called the Bible as literature. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=114.08s)]
*  But the person who filed this challenge just put it out there to see if they would follow [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  the same process and see what they're doing to other books. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=127.32s)]
*  And boy, did the lawmakers, the Republicans take the bait and all this outrage they expressed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=132.0s)]
*  in meetings and not just outrage, but actual threats in the meeting last week that they [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=138.4s)]
*  could charge them with if they don't just immediately take a book out that's been challenged [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=145.6s)]
*  as pornographic, they could charge them with felonies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=151.36s)]
*  But the Bible, they said things like this, the first step toward atheism and hedonism. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=155.16s)]
*  But all they did was the district followed their procedure of let parents and teacher [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=160.72s)]
*  review committees, so make a decision and they put it in high schools only. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=166.96s)]
*  That was it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  So do you think you to Republicans are simply going to end up changing their own rules here to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=174.8s)]
*  protect religious texts that they approve of? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=179.84s)]
*  There's some talk that the Book of Mormon could be challenged next, which would be hugely [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=182.08s)]
*  controversial in Utah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=185.88s)]
*  Yes, it would. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=187.12s)]
*  It would. But what they were pointing the person who challenged it, I assume they were [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=188.36s)]
*  pointing out is the bill is flawed because we should take everything in context and its [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=193.2s)]
*  literary value. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=200.56s)]
*  And that's they're not doing this with that with some books. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=201.96s)]
*  They're just saying these lines are what they call the bright line. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=205.8s)]
*  They're pornographic. They should be taken out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=210.6s)]
*  No, they should all books that are challenged should be looked at as a whole, not by individual [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=213.16s)]
*  words or passages. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=219.6s)]
*  And many, I just want to say they haven't they haven't discovered Shakespeare yet. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=221.48s)]
*  God help us all. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  So let's say you spent decades as an English teacher, as you say, you mentioned Shakespeare. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=228.76s)]
*  Big, big picture, big picture. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of this right wing campaign of book bannings in your state and across the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  country? What impact, in your view, is it having on our public schools, on the American [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  education system? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a huge impact in ordinate amount of time in the district I taught him with sixty two [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=248.04s)]
*  thousand students. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=253.64s)]
*  There have been ninety four books challenged by six people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=255.76s)]
*  And this is typical. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=260.72s)]
*  And these lists do not just come out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=261.96s)]
*  Many, I don't think people have even read. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=264.0s)]
*  They come from lists, groups like Moms for Liberty in Utah, Utah, Parents United. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=266.24s)]
*  It's a small but very organized group. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=272.84s)]
*  They're the same books, books that have been in the canon for years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=275.16s)]
*  The The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, beloved. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  See, they've gone from just looking for books that have to do with LGBTQ kids and BIPOC kids. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=283.04s)]
*  That's the primary list. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=291.12s)]
*  Now they're moving into established literary works. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=293.36s)]
*  And that's where I really say we have to draw the line. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=297.52s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent on this time, hours and hours instead of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=301.04s)]
*  working on kids learning to read. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=307.28s)]
*  See, I have many of those books. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=309.56s)]
*  I've read them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=311.24s)]
*  Kids that need to make up the losses during covid. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=313.2s)]
*  There's so many things we need to do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=316.4s)]
*  And what's happening, Meddy, is that teachers are leaving, librarians are quitting. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=318.44s)]
*  And that's the tragedy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=325.76s)]
*  It's part of what I see as an overall attempt to destroy public education, voucher bills, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=327.32s)]
*  homeschooling, many schools, more school choice. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  This is one aspect. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=338.55999999999995s)]
*  And it's very dangerous. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=339.76s)]
*  These are most important freedoms, the freedom to read, the freedom to speak, academic freedom. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=341.28s)]
*  And I'm very concerned about it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think there will be lawsuits to follow. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=349.96s)]
*  Pretty sure of it. These are unconstitutional laws. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  I do share your concern. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=357.0s)]
*  I'm glad you joined the dots there, making the point that this is about the deliberate [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=358.23999999999995s)]
*  destruction of public education. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  It's about much more than just books or lines and books. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=363.23999999999995s)]
*  Utah State Representative Carol Spackman Moss, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=365.96s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=371.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCXmGeIBVc&t=372.15999999999997s)]
