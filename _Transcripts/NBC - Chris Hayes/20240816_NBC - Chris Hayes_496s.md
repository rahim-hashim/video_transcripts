Video Description: Sen. Bernie Sanders joins Chris Hayes to discuss Kamala Harris’ newly unveiled economic agenda. “Given the fact that she has been a candidate for only three weeks, I think she’s doing really, really well in a whole lot of ways. I think what she laid out today was a strong, progressive agenda, obviously. In the weeks and months to come, I think she’s going to add more specificity to some of these proposals and she’s going to add to it,” says Sen. Sanders.

# ‘Strong, progressive agenda’: Sen. Bernie Sanders reacts to Harris’ economic agenda
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc)
*  Around the world, in basically every country, in the wake of the COVID crisis and the supply crunch [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=0.0s)]
*  afterwards, nearly every advanced economy has experienced inflation. Understandably, nearly every [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=4.72s)]
*  public in those nations has not liked it and expressed their frustration often by voting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=10.8s)]
*  against incumbents. Now, Donald Trump is with it enough still, I think, to understand those basic [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=16.56s)]
*  facts. So he has been constantly railing against inflation, trying to blame it on the Biden and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=22.56s)]
*  Harris administration. But if you listen to what he suggests actually doing about it, it just makes [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=27.36s)]
*  no sense. On my first day back in the Oval Office, I will sign an executive order directing every [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=33.28s)]
*  cabinet secretary and agency head to use every tool and authority at their disposal to defeat [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=41.04s)]
*  inflation and to bring consumer prices rapidly down. We'll do it very rapidly. We're going to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  have 10 to 20 percent tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. We're [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=53.92s)]
*  going to charge them 10 to 20 percent to come in and take advantage of our country because that's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=60.08s)]
*  what they've been doing for nothing. Okay, did you catch that? This is his one central inflation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=66.64s)]
*  fighting policy proposal. Enormous tariffs on every imported good. In other words, a sales tax [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=73.84s)]
*  on stuff that already costs a lot. Clothes, iPhones, you name it. It would increase the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=79.76s)]
*  cost of those goods. Yesterday, after a round of golf and a chat with the MyPillow guy, because of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  course, Trump tried again, he stepped out of his Bedminster, New Jersey summer home to point and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  gawk at a box of Cheerios and other grocery items. Again, without articulating any actual coherent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=95.2s)]
*  plan to bring down the price of those items. In fact, economists say that what passes for so-called [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  Trumponomics could actually cause inflation to spike. Now today, in marked contrast, Kamala [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=107.52s)]
*  Harris unveiled her economic agenda and it is a tangible set of policies focused on lowering [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=113.52s)]
*  consumer costs. I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=119.28s)]
*  I'll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone. By the end of my first term, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=128.56s)]
*  we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=134.96s)]
*  that are affordable for the middle class. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=141.84s)]
*  a tax cut and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle class and working [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=148.96s)]
*  Americans. The earned income tax credit [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=158.24s)]
*  and the child tax credit. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=166.24s)]
*  Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont calls the vice president's new economic agenda [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  bold and popular and he joins me now. Senator, obviously campaigns usually have a while to get [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=174.72s)]
*  started. This one is in a completely different category. They're kind of building the airplane [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=181.68s)]
*  while flying it. I think there's a real question about when the meat got put on the bones, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=186.72s)]
*  right? When you're saying, okay, here's the substance stuff, here's the policy, we're putting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=191.52s)]
*  out the papers and speeches, what it would look like. What's your reaction to what was unveiled [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=194.56s)]
*  today? Well, I think given the fact that she has been a candidate for only three weeks, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=198.48s)]
*  I think she's doing really, really well in a whole lot of ways. I think what she laid out today was [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=205.04s)]
*  a strong progressive agenda, obviously, in the weeks and months to come. I think she's going to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=210.24s)]
*  add more specificity to some of these proposals and she's going to add to it. But Chris, I have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=215.92s)]
*  always believed that good policy is good politics. And what she is talking about today is reining in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs that's enormously popular, the right thing to do. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=228.32s)]
*  She's talking about building three million units of affordable housing at a time when we have a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=234.72s)]
*  housing crisis in Burlington, Vermont, Los Angeles, California, and every place in between. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  We've got to lower the cost of housing in America. She's talking about ending medical debt so that a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=246.88s)]
*  quarter of the people in this country who have cancer do not have to deplete their savings or go [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=254.0s)]
*  bankrupt. So I think she's talking about controlling the cost of groceries when we know that there's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=260.0s)]
*  been massive concentration of ownership in that industry. They spike prices up and going after them [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=267.6s)]
*  is exactly the right thing to do and very good politics. I want to talk about the housing because [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  it's been very striking to me. The first campaign ad, one of the first campaign ads in the Harris [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=280.56s)]
*  campaign mentioned two issues, prescription drugs, cost of housing, talking about sort of using sort [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  of policy mechanisms to cap rental increases for big, big corporate landlords, talking about [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  building new supply today. In my time covering democratic politics, I have never seen housing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=296.16s)]
*  and the cost of housing more central in a presidential campaign than I've seen it just, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=301.68s)]
*  I would say, in the first few weeks of the Harris campaign. Do you agree with that? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=307.6s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think many of us have been negligent in really perceiving the nature of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  the housing crisis in America. I got it now. I've been out in every place I go, Chris. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=322.48s)]
*  People say we can't find affordable housing, homelessness, 600,000 people. So I think she's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=328.0s)]
*  absolutely right to talk about that issue as well as the high cost of prescription drugs. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=334.24s)]
*  There was an interesting kind of ideological tug of war that was happening in this period where [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=340.72s)]
*  President Joe Biden said he's not going to seek the nomination. Kamala Harris became the nominee [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=347.76s)]
*  about what her economic vision would be, particularly some of it centered on Lena [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=354.08s)]
*  Kahn, who's the head of the FTC and has been very, very aggressive in fighting antitrust, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=360.0s)]
*  big conglomerates. Do you feel like you have a better sense of that? This seemed to me [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=367.92s)]
*  a full-throated endorsement of Lena Kahn's work at the FTC, of going after concentration in big [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  corporations. Well, Chris, as you know, there were some Democratic donors, big money interests, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=379.84s)]
*  who don't like the work that Lena Kahn is doing. I happen to think she's the best FTC chair that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=387.68s)]
*  we have had for a very, very long time. And if Kamala Harris is going to be successful [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=393.84s)]
*  in taking on corporate greed, in taking on concentration of ownership, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=400.64s)]
*  she's going to need somebody like Lena Kahn at the head of the FTC. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=405.76s)]
*  Finally, Senator, do you think that the price issue still sort of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=412.08s)]
*  crowds everything out in people's perception of the economy the way it did, say, six months ago, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=420.8s)]
*  a year ago? Well, inflation is going down. But I think especially when you walk into a grocery [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=426.08s)]
*  store, people are legitimately concerned. And by the way, Chris, one of the other issues that she [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=432.88s)]
*  talked about today was the expansion of the child tax credit and making it permanent. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=439.68s)]
*  In the American Rescue Plan, we, by doing that, cut childhood poverty in America by over 40 percent, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=446.24s)]
*  one provision in one bill. You make that permanent. We deal with the outrage that in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=454.8s)]
*  the richest country in the world, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  major country. So paying attention to the needs of parents and kids is enormously important, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=464.0s)]
*  and I'm glad she's doing that. Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time tonight. Appreciate it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBQcUvRKRc&t=470.32s)]
