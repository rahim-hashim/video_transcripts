# ‘Preposterous': Conspiracy theorists think John Fetterman uses a ‘body double’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=0.0s)]
*  The extent to which the Republican Party has been consumed by bizarre, deranged, and dangerous conspiracy theories [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=2.4s)]
*  will likely end up as one of the defining political issues of our time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=9.0s)]
*  In fact, to a certain degree, democracy and the fate of the planet all depend on how we deal with it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Here's a small but perfect example. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=19.0s)]
*  Last night, we had that man, Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, on this program. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=21.2s)]
*  The guy has really been through the wringer over the past 18 months. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=25.8s)]
*  He quite famously suffered a stroke midway through his campaign for Senate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=29.4s)]
*  And then he got back on the trail before he even had time to fully recover his speech faculties. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=33.4s)]
*  Fetterman won that race decisively anyway, much to the surprise of a lot of observers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=38.6s)]
*  And since ascending the Senate, he's become the subject of this truly stupid, insidious, honestly pretty funny conspiracy theory [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=43.8s)]
*  that he has been replaced by an identical body double. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=52.0s)]
*  One post from one of Elon Musk's favorite accounts implied that it had to be a body double on our program last night [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=56.8s)]
*  because, get this, the senator's speech processing has improved greatly since the early days of his stroke. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=64.2s)]
*  Real geniuses working over there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=71.6s)]
*  A popular meme used selectively cropped images to make it look like the senator's tattoos were missing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=73.8s)]
*  in a viral clip of him reacting sarcastically to the news of a Republican impeachment inquiry into President Biden, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=78.8s)]
*  which raises a number of questions, one of which is why would anybody go to the trouble of hiring a Fetterman lookalike, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=84.4s)]
*  hard enough as it is, and then forget to add his very prominent tattoos? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=91.0s)]
*  And how many 6'8", 300 pound bald dudes with mustaches are there just hanging around anyway? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=95.0s)]
*  How do you run that casting call? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=102.2s)]
*  Now, the senator has taken this ridiculous conspiracy in stride. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  Last month, he posted this video to social media. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  During my time during the hospital, the fringy fringies really came up with a conspiracy that I have a body double. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=112.4s)]
*  And I just want you to know that is just crazy. That's not true. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=119.4s)]
*  And I hate, you know, dude, John, what event am I supposed to be doing this afternoon? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=123.4s)]
*  Dude, really. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=128.0s)]
*  Get the two of us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=129.4s)]
*  Okay, so on the one hand, all this is pretty funny. We had some fun with it today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=132.8s)]
*  But what it says about the state of American political discourse is serious. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=136.8s)]
*  As Mark Bankston, an attorney representing families of victims in the Sandy Hook massacre, notes, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=142.2s)]
*  quote, My clients have dealt with this nonsense every single day for over 10 years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=148.2s)]
*  A collection of deranged Infowars fans harassed my client Lenny Posner every day, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=155.2s)]
*  claiming that his changed appearance in a court video last year proves he is actually a different man than the press pictures on the day of the tragedy 10 years ago. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=161.2s)]
*  They bombard him and everyone he knows with emails attaching bizarre facial comparisons of different pictures, and they won't be convinced otherwise. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=169.2s)]
*  That's decidedly less funny and raging, actually. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=178.2s)]
*  That completely paranoid, preposterous, conspiratorial thinking, again, is not the fringes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=182.2s)]
*  It is the dominant mode of collective reasoning of one of our two major political coalitions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=188.2s)]
*  We've only got two. One of them is dominated by this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=196.2s)]
*  It dominates half the country's experience of reality, more or less. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=199.2s)]
*  It was on full display in the case of Ray Epps, the former Oath Keeper and January 6 rioter, the center of another ludicrous conspiracy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=204.2s)]
*  As that theory goes, Epps, who was at the grounds of the Capitol on January 6 and who talked about storming the building the night before, was actually a plant. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=212.2s)]
*  He was working with the FBI to incite the riot as a false flag. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=220.2s)]
*  He was there to make Trump and his supporters look bad by convincing them to go into the Capitol, which no one else wanted to do, obviously, right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=225.2s)]
*  Now, to be clear, this is, again, like the Federman body double, preposterous on its face, obviously false theory. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=232.2s)]
*  But again, this is not just randos on Twitter posting screenshots. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=239.2s)]
*  This was not relegated to the fringes of social media. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=244.2s)]
*  It was being pushed by prominent cable news hosts and members of Congress. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=247.2s)]
*  Ray Epps is one of the only people caught on camera that day encouraging others to break the law. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=252.2s)]
*  He's one of the only ones. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=259.2s)]
*  The question is, did Ray Epps work or have any contact with any government agency? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=261.2s)]
*  Did he talk about January 6 before it happened with any employee of the U.S. government? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=266.2s)]
*  On the 6th, it's not the Proud Boys who engage in the initial breach. It's Ray Epps. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=272.2s)]
*  On the night of January 5th, 2021, Epps wandered around the crowd that had gathered. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=278.2s)]
*  And there's video out there of him chanting, tomorrow we need to get into the Capitol, into the Capitol. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=284.2s)]
*  This was strange behavior. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=291.2s)]
*  A lot of Americans are concerned that the federal government deliberately encouraged illegal and violent conduct on January 6. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=293.2s)]
*  Again, I mean, think of what you just saw. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=302.2s)]
*  This is like Ted Cruz getting up there with big placards that his staff made up and they went to wherever to print her with like, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=304.2s)]
*  here's John Fetterman yesterday, here's him the day before, these are the same guy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=309.2s)]
*  Like it's that level. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=313.2s)]
*  As Ray Epps put it himself, the former Fox News host and his buddies in Congress tried to scapegoat him for their role in the big lie of a stolen election. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=315.2s)]
*  He's obsessed with me. He's going to any means possible to destroy my life and our lives. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=325.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=332.2s)]
*  To shift blame on somebody else. If you look at it, Fox News, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ted Cruz, Gates, they're all telling us before this thing that it was stolen. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=333.2s)]
*  So you tell me, who has more impact on people, them or me? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=347.2s)]
*  Now, Ray Epps is actually suing Fox News for defamation over the conspiracy theory. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=353.2s)]
*  Fox denies that it defamed Epps. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment to NBC News. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=360.2s)]
*  I should say the network just requested oral argument in its motion to dismiss the suit yesterday. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=366.2s)]
*  We'll see where that goes. I don't, you know, I don't have a say on it legally. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=371.2s)]
*  Here's the kicker. The key to this ridiculous 9-11 was an inside job level conspiracy always hinged on the fact that Ray Epps was not charged with a crime despite being caught on camera during the riot. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=375.2s)]
*  Today, Ray Epps was charged for what prosecutors say was his role on January 6th. He is expected to plead guilty. I think he's got a hearing tomorrow. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=388.2s)]
*  Will that put an end to it? Of course not. Of course it won't. Of course it won't. It won't put any of this to rest. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=396.2s)]
*  The conspiracy universe doesn't deal in reality and it doesn't deal with like some new set of facts. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=404.2s)]
*  So even though this idea that Epps is a Fed has been disproven again and again and again, the lie will live on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=410.2s)]
*  And Ray Epps is going to have to live with it. It's just like some segment of Trump supporters will always believe that the Chinese government, with the help of some Italian satellites and possibly the ghost of Hugo Chavez, managed to hack a bunch of machines to rig tens of thousands of votes in multiple states for President Joe Biden to win the election. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=416.2s)]
*  And of course, again, it all ties back to that guy, right, Donald Trump? Remember, how does he first make a splash in Republican politics that launches his political career? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=435.2s)]
*  By spreading, again, equally ridiculous John Fetterman body double level conspiracies about Barack Obama. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=446.2s)]
*  Recently you've spent a lot of time talking about President Obama's birth certificate or lack thereof. You don't seem convinced that he has one. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=455.2s)]
*  No, I'm not convinced that he has one. Three weeks ago when I started, I thought he was probably born in this country. And now I really have a much bigger doubt than I did before. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=463.2s)]
*  But based on what? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=471.2s)]
*  And you know what? His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth. OK? He doesn't have a birth certificate or he hasn't shown it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=472.2s)]
*  Now that was always an obvious, transparent and racist lie. Again, it was interesting. It got attention. It spoke to the biases certain people had already and it made them feel better about themselves because of it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=482.2s)]
*  And Donald Trump is good at that. And he brought that kind of conspiratorial thinking to the mainstream. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=496.2s)]
*  It is a core, if not the core, tentative is political philosophy of Trumpism writ large, right? The world is rigged. There's all these nefarious characters and Donald Trump sees through the matrix. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=502.2s)]
*  When one half of the country, again, not every individual, but like there are two political collisions. One of them is under the yoke of this way of thinking. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=512.2s)]
*  Egged on by their leaders in Washington, the media, it truly becomes harder on a functioning democracy, which, of course, I suspect is precisely the reason Donald Trump pushes it in the first place. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=524.2s)]
*  . [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRAzKaFvoc&t=554.2s)]
