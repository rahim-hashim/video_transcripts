# In first test as speaker, Johnson draws outrage, derision from Senate over spending stunts
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4)
*  After President Biden requested a $105 billion foreign aid package from Congress, which included [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=0.0s)]
*  $14 billion for Israel, $61 billion for Ukraine, newly minted Republican House Speaker Mike [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=5.64s)]
*  Johnson came back with a $14 billion standalone measure to provide funding just for Israel, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=10.24s)]
*  totally splitting off Ukraine, even taking a step further by clawing back that same amount [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=15.88s)]
*  from IRS funding provided by a landmark piece of Biden legislation, the Inflation Reduction [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Act. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Senator Johnson promoted that plan in an interview with Fox News today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=26.56s)]
*  Do you think that will drive away some Democrats in the Senate even or here in the House? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  It may, but my intention is to call Leader Schumer over there and have a very direct [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=35.2s)]
*  and thoughtful conversation about this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=40.4s)]
*  I understand their priority is to bulk up the IRS, but I think if you put this to the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=42.0s)]
*  American people and they weigh the two needs, I think they're going to say standing with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=47.2s)]
*  Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=51.32s)]
*  immediate need than IRS agents. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=55.82s)]
*  As you might expect, Leader Schumer is not having that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=57.46s)]
*  As for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, so far he's not giving Speaker Johnson's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  standalone plan much encouragement either. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=65.58s)]
*  Their price for helping Israel and abandoning America's responsibilities around the globe, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=69.34s)]
*  making it much easier for the ultra-rich to cheat on their taxes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=75.82s)]
*  How the heck could that be their highest priority? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=80.7s)]
*  It's only when the hard right governs the Republican caucus. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=84.0s)]
*  In order to make a law that's passed both bodies and be signed by the president, and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=88.24s)]
*  we'll see if the bill comes out of the House and if so, what kind of margin it has. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  This is Speaker Johnson's first major legislative move, the first big test of his ability to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=100.56s)]
*  govern and honestly should not be a difficult one. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=104.28s)]
*  And yet Charlie Dentz, former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, he served six terms in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=107.08s)]
*  the House from 2005 to 2018 and he joins me now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=112.16s)]
*  Well, first, what do you think about, I mean, there's a lot here that's wild to me. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=115.16s)]
*  Number one, that usually emergency spending like this you don't offset or have pay for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=120.16s)]
*  is for. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=125.08s)]
*  Second of all, this isn't even a pay for because it's going to cost the deficit more because [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=126.08s)]
*  you get back less tax revenue. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=129.44s)]
*  And third of all, it just seems like DOA. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=131.64s)]
*  So what do you think of this as a first move from new Speaker Mike Johnson? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=133.66s)]
*  Well, it strikes me as a simple sop to the hardliners within the conference. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  So they attempt to pass a bill like this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  Maybe they can get the votes to get it out of the House. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=145.52s)]
*  It'll go to the Senate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=147.52s)]
*  They'll strip it out. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=148.52s)]
*  It'll strip out the pay for and then they'll add funding for Ukraine, the border and disaster [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=149.52s)]
*  assistance in all likelihood. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=155.44s)]
*  That's what will happen. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  I suspect I would not have launched this way. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=158.58s)]
*  They don't have a lot of time to be messing around with these things. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  I was on the Appropriations Committee for several terms and I can tell you, you're going [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=164.04s)]
*  to need a bipartisan consensus to pass a bill. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=168.44s)]
*  There's a bipartisan support in the House to support Ukraine funding. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=170.6s)]
*  And certainly the Senate will need 60 votes to pass what it's going to pass. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=174.16s)]
*  So the House will probably get jammed at the end of this process. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=177.2s)]
*  So that OK, that's what I think, too. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  But here's my question about this whole thing and why we're in this situation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=181.68s)]
*  So OK, so they passed this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=185.68s)]
*  They sent it over to the Senate, get stripped out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=187.22s)]
*  They get jammed by the Senate, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=189.0s)]
*  At some point, then what happens? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=191.12s)]
*  Does Mike Johnson bring that bill to the floor and you're just going to pass it? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  And the House Republicans say that's fine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=198.88s)]
*  This is where we knew it ended up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=200.64s)]
*  Or is there another rebellion? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=202.48s)]
*  Well, look, I suspect Speaker Johnson is going to have to bring up the Senate bill. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=205.0s)]
*  If he doesn't bring up the Senate bill, you'll have a shutdown. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=210.44s)]
*  You'll have a shutdown. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=213.88s)]
*  And I also get the sense that many of the hardliners who took out Kevin McCarthy might [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  be willing to give Mike Johnson some slack on his first continuing resolution to fund [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=220.84s)]
*  the government. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=225.44s)]
*  What I'm really curious to see, though, is just how long they want to pass this continuing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=226.44s)]
*  resolution for. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=230.72s)]
*  I suspect the Senate would like to pass it into December, but I get the sense that the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=233.44s)]
*  Speaker Johnson's talk about passing it into January or maybe even to April. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  So that's another bone of contention. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=242.08s)]
*  But bottom line is, I think Speaker Johnson is going to be given some slack from his hardliners [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=244.28s)]
*  who took out Kevin McCarthy, I think more for personal reasons than any particular policy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  matter. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=252.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Politico is reporting today, that most hard right members said they're [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=253.68s)]
*  willing to give Johnson room to maneuver on a continuing resolution, given the short timeline [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=256.68s)]
*  in his own history as a, quote, conservative hardliner. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=262.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about another bit of news that developed over the weekend. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's funny because I think alternate universe, it would have been a huge deal that we would [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=269.12s)]
*  be covering a lot, which is Mike Pence's announcement that he's dropping out of the race for president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  He was at a Republican event in Vegas over the weekend. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=278.56s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=282.72s)]
*  This is not my time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=285.08s)]
*  So after much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign for president [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=289.56s)]
*  effective today. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=295.88s)]
*  Were you surprised by that? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=298.68s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=300.04s)]
*  I'm not at all surprised. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=301.6s)]
*  I think he's right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=303.2s)]
*  It's not his time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=304.36s)]
*  And frankly, it's really not his party anymore either. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=305.64s)]
*  Nor mine, I should note. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=308.4s)]
*  I think Mike Pence is really run as a more very traditional socially conservative candidate [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=310.12s)]
*  in a party that really is very much more populous these days. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=317.96s)]
*  When Mike Pence was at his prime, he was kind of like one of the leaders of the ideological [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=321.8s)]
*  purity police who wanted to enforce certain amount of doctrinaire thinking within the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=327.44s)]
*  Republican Party, whether it was on abortion or gun rights or the economy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=333.56s)]
*  But since Trump came on the scene, you know, Trump, we can say what we will about him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=338.44s)]
*  He was not ideological or doctrinaire. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=343.88s)]
*  He was pragmatic to a fault. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=345.84s)]
*  He had unfixed policy positions and they shifted all the time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  Of course, Mike Pence is just the opposite, very fixed and rigid positions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  But that's not where this party is anymore. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  It's populist. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=356.84s)]
*  And it's really more about anger than it is about any particular policy positions. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=358.2s)]
*  It's more about outraging grievance, frankly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=363.12s)]
*  And it's almost been a policy free zone under Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=365.68s)]
*  And, you know, I think Pence and some other candidates are trying to bring it back to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=368.8s)]
*  policy, whether you agree with our policies or not. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0J49AhFDU4&t=372.52s)]
