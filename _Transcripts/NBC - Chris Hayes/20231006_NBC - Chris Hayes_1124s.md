# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 5
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s)
*  The last time that Donald Trump wanted to go to the Capitol, it was to lead a violent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=0.0s)]
*  coup against the duly elected American government. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=5.2s)]
*  Now remember, this is when he supposedly had a tantrum in the presidential limousine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=8.08s)]
*  He wanted to go so badly that he got into a physical altercation with the Secret Service [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=12.68s)]
*  over it, according to testimony before the January 6th Committee. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=17.32s)]
*  Now the Secret Service understood that sending the president to lead an armed riot would [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=20.76s)]
*  present something of a safety concern. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  But in some ways, more importantly, I think they also understood that they could end up [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=29.92s)]
*  in a situation where they were essentially drafted into service as the armed praetorian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=34.68s)]
*  guard of the would-be coup, entering the Capitol with the duty to protect the president in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  defiance of the armed police officers who were defending it, gun against gun, creating [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=46.8s)]
*  a situation of unprecedented constitutional peril. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=54.24s)]
*  Thankfully, that did not happen. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=58.92s)]
*  The Secret Service held their ground. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=61.08s)]
*  They didn't let him go. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=62.24s)]
*  But now Donald Trump wants to go to the Capitol again to continue the project he started on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=64.12s)]
*  January 6th, ending American democracy as we know it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=69.36s)]
*  Part of that includes undermining the Department of Justice's investigation into him, their [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=73.12s)]
*  attempt to hold him accountable to law so he does not have to go to prison. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=77.6s)]
*  In fact, today, he filed a motion to dismiss the January 6th case outright against him, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=82.88s)]
*  citing presidential immunity. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  He is hoping this motion will make its way to the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=91.28s)]
*  he appointed one-third of and that they will find a way to let him off the hook, at the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=95.2s)]
*  very least delay things until after the election. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=99.28s)]
*  That is the play here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  But if that does not work, Donald Trump is publicly floating he could be the next speaker [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=103.92s)]
*  of the House after Republicans fired the last guy for the first time in American history. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=108.08s)]
*  A lot of people have been calling me about Speaker. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  All I can say is we'll do whatever is best for the country and for the Republican Party. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=117.76s)]
*  Would you take the job? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=122.8s)]
*  A lot of people have asked me about it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=124.56s)]
*  If I can help them during the process, I would do it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=126.16s)]
*  But we have some great people in the Republican Party that can do a great job as Speaker. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=129.12s)]
*  Just a few hours ago, Trump told Fox News, quote, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=134.96s)]
*  They have asked me if I would take it for a short period of time for the party until [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=137.28s)]
*  they come to a conclusion. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=141.12s)]
*  I'm not doing it because I want to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=142.56s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=144.48s)]
*  I will do it if necessary should they not be able to make their decision. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=145.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=151.04s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=151.76s)]
*  Look, it goes without saying, I think, that Donald Trump as Speaker of the House, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=153.76s)]
*  third in line of the presidency or second in line of the presidency, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=158.32s)]
*  would be bad for everyone. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=162.72s)]
*  Probably disastrous. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  It would be bad for the country, bad for American democracy, and I think outright dangerous. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=164.8s)]
*  Becoming Speaker would not automatically absolve Trump of his criminal liability, although [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=170.08s)]
*  I think he might have some notion it will. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=173.76s)]
*  So I sincerely hope it does not happen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=176.0s)]
*  The fundamental problem, of course, is that Trump or someone like him is what the Republican [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=179.52s)]
*  base is demanding. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=184.32s)]
*  To some extent, MAGA voters want their party to be ungovernable. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  A lot of this has been stoked by cynical voices in the party and the right wing media, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=191.68s)]
*  to be fair, people that are making a lot of money off this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=196.32s)]
*  But if you want a perfect illustration of this problem, let's just game out what would [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=200.16s)]
*  happen if Trump were to become Speaker. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  At the most basic level, it appears that they would have to change the actual House rules, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=205.84s)]
*  because as of now, the House rules quite sensibly say that someone who's been indicted [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=210.64s)]
*  for a felony that carries more than two years in prison cannot serve in leadership. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=215.2s)]
*  The problem is many folks in the MAGA movement want Trump for Speaker, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=222.4s)]
*  not in spite of his indictments, but because of them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=225.76s)]
*  Because Trump matters to them inasmuch as he can enrage the people they don't like and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=228.56s)]
*  crucially vandalize, desecrate, and destroy the institutions they have come to despise. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  The best thing we could do right now is have President Trump on an interim basis [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=239.28s)]
*  return to the nation's capital, walk in to the sanctuary of Nancy Pelosi. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=243.04s)]
*  Think about it for a second. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  How would the established order accept that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  That's what he's got for you folks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=254.0s)]
*  That dude in his two shirts and his four-hour live stream every day, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=255.76s)]
*  awaiting possibly going to prison. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=259.36s)]
*  Remember, there were people that invaded the Capitol and actually defecated in the halls? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=263.2s)]
*  Like, basically, that's the selling point here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=267.52s)]
*  Is that a vision of what a good life would look like, a good society, a good government? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=271.76s)]
*  No. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=276.4s)]
*  That's the vision. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=276.96s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=277.84s)]
*  That's what they got. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=278.48s)]
*  They're not trying to hide their motivations here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=279.44s)]
*  There's a new pullout today that provides a really incredible case study and a sort of study in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=281.68s)]
*  contrast between that vision, the Steve Bannon vision articulated there, and the Democratic [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=287.84s)]
*  Party and its base as to how the two parties, both in leadership and among the base, approach [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=292.24s)]
*  this same issue. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  So as you've no doubt heard, and has been covered on this program and many others on this network, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=298.0s)]
*  Democratic Senator Bob Menendez in New Jersey was indicted on federal charges last month. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=302.96s)]
*  In a stunningly detailed indictment, he's been accused of taking bribes to abuse his position [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=307.6s)]
*  as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and provide special favors to the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=314.56s)]
*  government of Egypt. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=317.68s)]
*  Now, Senator Menendez has denied the charges. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  He says he will vigorously mount a defense. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  And we should note, the last time he was indicted by the Department of Justice, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  they did fail to secure a conviction. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=326.72s)]
*  So, you know, that's a good thing to know. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  And of course, the senator is due the presumption of innocence in a court of law, like all American [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=330.88s)]
*  citizens protected by the Constitution. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=335.84s)]
*  But the presumption of innocent doesn't provide some magical immunity in the court of public [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=339.28s)]
*  opinion. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=344.32s)]
*  People are allowed to form opinions about you, especially when you are a sitting politician. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  You can't just say, well, well, due process. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=348.56s)]
*  And you can see that in the way the Democratic Party has responded to, again, that very damning [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=351.28s)]
*  indictment of Senator Menendez, as at least two dozen Democratic senators have called on Menendez [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  to resign, including Cory Booker, junior Democrat from New Jersey, Phil Murphy, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=361.44s)]
*  state's Democratic governor, has also said Menendez needs to go. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=365.36s)]
*  And then today we got this, which is, to me, fascinating. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  It says a lot, okay? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=372.0s)]
*  We have the first look at what Democratic primary voters think, basically the Democratic base. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=373.2s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  Unlike in the Republican Party, the indictment has not helped Robert Menendez. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  In fact, the indictment has done what you would expect in a normal environment. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=386.48s)]
*  Menendez is losing badly. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=391.68s)]
*  He's polling at 5%. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=394.72s)]
*  That's the sitting incumbent Democratic senator. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  He's pulling at 5% in the three-way race. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=399.68s)]
*  Andy Kim, who's thrown his hat in the ring as a Democratic congressman in New Jersey, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=402.24s)]
*  has 42%. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  And again, that's just based on the news. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  Sitting senator, indictment, Democratic Party leadership says the guy's got to go. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=411.04s)]
*  That's how Democratic base voters respond. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=415.92s)]
*  But that's just one of the two gravitational fields that exist in the physics of American [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=418.48s)]
*  politics at the moment. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  There are two different gravitational fields that exist. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  There is one where you get indicted and everything pulls towards your resignation. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=430.0s)]
*  Your party calls for you to resign. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=435.6s)]
*  Voters abandon you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  Then there's another where you get indicted on 91 charges in four jurisdictions, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=439.12s)]
*  and the party pushes you towards leadership and increased popularity. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=443.6s)]
*  Your poll numbers go up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=447.12s)]
*  Not only that, but in addition to supporting you for president, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=449.68s)]
*  the party encourages you to run for House of Representatives in the interim. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  Run the House of Representatives. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=455.92s)]
*  And all of this, ultimately, in furtherance of the vile political project you began [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=458.4s)]
*  when you tried to overthrow American democracy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=464.64s)]
*  Claire, any moment over the last eight years where there's some little piece of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=468.64s)]
*  data in the world that just makes me feel like I'm standing on earth, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=472.56s)]
*  I feel this like a brief relief. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=477.68s)]
*  And when I saw the polling of Menendez today, it was like, right, again, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=480.0s)]
*  I don't know if he's guilty. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=483.68s)]
*  I can't say if they're going to prove his case. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=485.04s)]
*  But yeah, the indictment looked really bad. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=486.96s)]
*  And Democratic leadership has said this guy's a problem. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=491.12s)]
*  And the voters are like, yeah, I don't like this. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=494.16s)]
*  And that to me was like, right, this is how it can work and does work [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=496.24s)]
*  in one portion of American politics. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=500.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is the way it's supposed to work. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=503.68s)]
*  I mean, in one party, you have people who want the norms of ethical behavior [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=506.24s)]
*  and the respect for the rule of law. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=513.28s)]
*  And frankly, the sense that whether he did something legal or not, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=516.24s)]
*  what's in that indictment makes him unattractive to vote for as a United States Senator. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=521.6s)]
*  Yes, yes, exactly. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=527.12s)]
*  That's the essence here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=528.16s)]
*  That's the essence here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=530.0s)]
*  On the other hand, you've got a guy indicted, as you say, 91 felony counts. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=530.96s)]
*  And his party wants to bring him back to the Capitol and have him in charge [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=536.96s)]
*  of the only part of government they control. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=544.72s)]
*  I mean, honestly, Chris, this is a break the glass moment. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=547.2s)]
*  Because if there aren't enough Republicans that stand up and say, come on, folks, really? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=550.48s)]
*  Are we really going to go down? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  All those guys that won and women that won Biden districts, they're done. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=561.28s)]
*  They are done. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=567.12s)]
*  I mean, Hakeem Jeffries will be the new Speaker of the House in January of 2025. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=568.24s)]
*  End of discussion. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=575.36s)]
*  Talk about how to win 2024. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=576.4799999999999s)]
*  Let Donald Trump back in the Capitol. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=578.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=581.52s)]
*  I mean, I tend to agree with you, although again, always hedge with the fact that the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  future is uncertain and lots of crazy stuff has happened in the time that I've been hosting [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=585.44s)]
*  this television show. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=590.08s)]
*  But yes, I mean, my next question to you was when you think about the vote on the motion [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=590.72s)]
*  vacate, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  So all the Republicans are mad because it was eight votes, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=595.84s)]
*  Tiny little sliver of the caucus. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=599.44s)]
*  And I understand why they're mad. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=600.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's annoying when eight of your colleagues basically blow this thing up. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=602.0s)]
*  The question is, the math works the same way in reverse, right? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=608.6400000000001s)]
*  It's like the speaker needs to get 217 or 218, depending on, I think, 217 because there's [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=611.12s)]
*  a few vacancies. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=615.92s)]
*  There's eight members in the House of Republican caucus who should be able to say, no way. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=618.48s)]
*  No, we're not voting for Donald Trump for speaker. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=625.04s)]
*  They've got the same power and the same leverage in this situation. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=627.76s)]
*  It's just a question of whether they're too cowardly to exercise it if it comes to that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=630.08s)]
*  Yeah, I want to believe that this is just him looking for another moment [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=636.32s)]
*  to be in the room. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=640.88s)]
*  And I think it probably is. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=642.32s)]
*  But the fact that they think it's a good idea to tout it, independent voters, I believe [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=644.96s)]
*  by and large, the majority of them will be horrified at this idea. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=651.84s)]
*  And I think everybody ought to remember back if Gates's deal was about the deficit, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=655.92s)]
*  they controlled government the first two years of Trump's presidential term. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=662.0s)]
*  They controlled everything. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=666.64s)]
*  They didn't do anything on deficit. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=667.92s)]
*  And that was pre-COVID. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=669.92s)]
*  They did nothing on the deficit. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=671.28s)]
*  They did nothing to bring down spending. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=672.64s)]
*  He believed in running up the debt. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=674.56s)]
*  He didn't do anything to secure the southern border. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=676.56s)]
*  They did nothing on immigration reform. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=678.8s)]
*  So as if this guy was a strong leader, that if he just had the levers of power, he could [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=680.88s)]
*  deliver on all the things the crazy caucus says they want, that would be one thing. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=686.4s)]
*  But we know he can't. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=690.8s)]
*  He didn't, even when they controlled all of government. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=692.56s)]
*  So it is, and I may know that's a normal analysis, not a crazy town analysis, but it [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=696.88s)]
*  would help these guys if they would look back and see what Trump actually did when he was [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=702.8s)]
*  president. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=708.4s)]
*  Forget all the lying, just how bad he was at delivering on anything they believed in. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=708.88s)]
*  Observers around the world are watching, of course, what has happened in the United [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=715.84s)]
*  States the last few years. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=718.72s)]
*  They've seen a deadly insurrection, sacking of the nation's capital. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=719.6s)]
*  Its president impeached twice, indicted four times, facing trial, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=722.88s)]
*  possibly still poised to take back power. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=726.48s)]
*  The country's speaker of the House position made vacant by allies of the corrupt ex-president, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=729.28s)]
*  and also the increasing political violence being carried out across the country by his [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=735.04s)]
*  followers. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=738.4s)]
*  You can understand they quite understandably worry about the stability of this country [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  and what that means for the world. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=743.12s)]
*  Michael Beschloss is NBC News presidential historian, and he joins me now. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=745.6s)]
*  Michael, you know, one thing I always try to tell myself when I try to get to presentists [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=751.28s)]
*  is that, you know, the U.S. has been through periods of pretty intense political violence, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=757.36s)]
*  obviously the Civil War and the political violence reconstruction, but in the 1920s, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=762.4s)]
*  during the 1960s. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=767.36s)]
*  So I want to put things in a historical perspective. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=768.4s)]
*  I'm curious where you sort of see us right now in that sense. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=771.52s)]
*  Well, it's a violent country. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=775.52s)]
*  It's not the only thing to know about America, but just as you're saying, slavery was continuous [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  violence for centuries, violence against Native Americans. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=781.84s)]
*  Just as you're saying, the Civil War and Jim Crow, and also in the early 1960s, for instance, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  after John Kennedy sent a big civil rights bill to Congress, if you look at his FBI files, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  the number of death threats against President Kennedy rose. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=798.08s)]
*  1990s, you know, the violence against the federal government both threatened and actual, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=802.24s)]
*  Oklahoma City, the bombing of the building, other domestic terrorists threatening. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=808.88s)]
*  But the difference between that time and this time is this. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=814.0s)]
*  In the 1990s, for instance, when those threats were there, when the actual tragedy of Oklahoma [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=818.0s)]
*  City happened in 1995, we could rely on the president of the United States, both parties [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=823.84s)]
*  in Congress and across the country to say that violence of this kind is outside the American [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=831.04s)]
*  system and has to be stopped. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=837.44s)]
*  Peace has to be restored. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=839.52s)]
*  Now we're in a situation where many more guns in America, gun safety laws have been relaxed, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=841.52s)]
*  and you've got one of the two parties, the Republican Party, absolutely seduced by Donald [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=848.64s)]
*  Trump, who loves violence, who, when he was president, threatened to invoke the Insurrection [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=854.16s)]
*  Act or martial law to stop violence. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  This is now in the heart of America, not on the fringe. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and that point about what you might call organic political violence by certain [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=868.0s)]
*  factions, and it might be quite sophisticated or deadly in the case of Oklahoma City bombing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=874.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=880.1600000000001s)]
*  But that is the difference. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=880.6400000000001s)]
*  The person who is likely to be the nominee of one of the two major parties, the leader [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  of that party, his countenancing of it, his encouraging, I mean, one of the most chilling [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=886.96s)]
*  moments, I didn't even mention it, but I want to bring it up here, and we're not going to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=890.88s)]
*  play it because it's actually too despicable to do so, but he was in that room in California [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=893.36s)]
*  at our fundraiser, and he made a joke about Speaker Pelosi's husband, who was savagely [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=898.08s)]
*  attacked, an 80-year-old man in his home. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=905.92s)]
*  He says, how's he doing? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=909.92s)]
*  And the crowd roars. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=911.12s)]
*  And that, to me, the message that sends to anyone that wants to do something horrible [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=912.72s)]
*  is that he's got your back, that he approves of it, and that, to me, seems really pretty [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=918.08s)]
*  unique and uniquely dangerous. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=923.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  And in modern times, when did we ever hear a president or an ex-president ever say something [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=926.64s)]
*  remotely like that, and people applaud, and it gets normalized? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=932.32s)]
*  Plus, in modern times, domestic terrorists and people like the one that assaulted Paul [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=937.2800000000001s)]
*  Pelosi, perhaps, these people can now contact each other on the dark web. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=944.72s)]
*  They couldn't do that in Jim Crow, Alabama, in 1925. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=949.6s)]
*  This is a very new period. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  And so if you get a possible next president of the United States, if Donald Trump is elected [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  13 months from today, exactly, or if someone like Jim Jordan becomes Speaker of the House, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=962.24s)]
*  just as you were saying earlier, Chris, where was he on January 6th? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=968.96s)]
*  Why can't he remember what kind of conversations he had or did not have with Donald Trump [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=973.36s)]
*  at a time that Donald Trump may have been running that whole operation to wage a coup [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  d'état and conquer Congress? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=984.0s)]
*  One-third of our Supreme Court was appointed by Donald Trump. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=986.72s)]
*  We're not in a situation that we might have been in, let's say, in the 90s, where we could [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=991.04s)]
*  depend on all three branches of our government to protect us against this kind of violence. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=995.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1002.32s)]
*  And there's also the question of federal law enforcement and what they do about it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  And obviously, this is a longstanding question. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1006.64s)]
*  You have huge attacks against federal law enforcement in the 90s and what happened at [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1009.28s)]
*  Waco and Ruby Ridge providing inspiration for folks like Timothy McVeigh. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1015.2s)]
*  And of course, a very tortured and complicated legacy of how the FBI has dealt with this. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1020.72s)]
*  Incredibly despicable acts in COINTELPRO and things they did in the Red Scare. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1026.32s)]
*  But also going after the Klan in the South. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1032.08s)]
*  You've got the situation now where the FBI is seen as the deep state and any motions [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1034.32s)]
*  they start to make to try to deal with this is immediately subject to a political backlash [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1039.36s)]
*  in Congress and on Fox News. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1043.28s)]
*  And what has Donald Trump said? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1045.84s)]
*  He has said, flat out, elect me president. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1047.36s)]
*  I will neutralize the FBI, which is a malign organization. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1051.04s)]
*  I'll do the same thing with the Department of Justice. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1056.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1058.1599999999999s)]
*  And I will essentially appoint lackeys at the Pentagon. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1058.64s)]
*  Can I say one more thing, Chris? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  Please. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1063.5200000000002s)]
*  What you were saying at the beginning, which was brilliant and trenchant, we should all [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1064.48s)]
*  pay attention to your warning, reminded me a little bit of Franklin Roosevelt, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1068.64s)]
*  who was very aware of vulnerable populations in the United States. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1072.8000000000002s)]
*  In the late 1930s, he said privately, direct quote, he said, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1077.44s)]
*  if a demagogue ever took up anti-Semitic violence in America, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  he said there would be more blood running in the streets of New York City than in Berlin. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1086.56s)]
*  You need a president who understands that this potential is there to protect every [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1092.08s)]
*  American against that, not to try to encourage it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1097.12s)]
*  Well said, Michael Beschloss. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1101.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1102.32s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1102.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyLH-KSW8s&t=1116.56s)]
