# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 10  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=0.0s)]
*  I would rather lose by telling the truth than lie in order to win. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Chris Christie drops out with no endorsement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=10.72s)]
*  Anyone who is unwilling to say that he is unfit to be president of the United States [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=14.32s)]
*  is unfit themselves to be president of the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=22.2s)]
*  As the rest of the field panders to MAGA. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=26.28s)]
*  Don't just build the wall, build both walls. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=30.0s)]
*  Anthony, you are fired. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=32.28s)]
*  Tonight what Christie's departure means to the race and a party led by an indicted front [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=34.6s)]
*  runner. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=39.08s)]
*  That. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=40.08s)]
*  Sits here with a smug look on his face and runs away when it's my turn to talk. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=41.08s)]
*  How the tent collapsed on the MAGA circus with Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and George [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=47.32s)]
*  on how Trump attorneys walk into a trap in a D.C. courtroom. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=53.16s)]
*  It all starts right now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=56.31999999999999s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=63.48s)]
*  I'm Chris Haver. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  We've got a major development tonight in the race for the Republican nomination. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  Chris Christie, the only candidate in the Republican side telling the truth about Donald [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump and his attempted coup was essentially forced out of the primary race. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=72.28s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=77.32s)]
*  Now, just before he made the announcement that he is dropping out, the former governor [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=78.32s)]
*  of New Jersey was caught on a hot mic bluntly explaining how his campaign's message just [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=81.72s)]
*  did not resonate with the voters. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=88.28s)]
*  People don't want to hear it when they don't want to hear it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=90.48s)]
*  We know we're right, but they don't want to hear it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=94.92s)]
*  And there's, you know, we couldn't have been any clearer if we couldn't have been any more [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=97.88s)]
*  any more director worked any harder. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=103.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, when you give land to China and places like that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you get. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=111.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=112.56s)]
*  I mean, look, she's spent 68 million so far just on TV. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=113.56s)]
*  She's spent 68 million so far, 59 million by DeSantis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=116.44s)]
*  And we spent 12. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=120.84s)]
*  I mean, who's punching above their weight and who's getting a return on their investment, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=121.84s)]
*  you know, and she's going to get smoked. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=126.12s)]
*  And you and I both know it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=128.68s)]
*  She's not up to this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=129.68s)]
*  She hasn't even been. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=130.68s)]
*  She's still 20 points behind Trump in the race show. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=131.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=136.8s)]
*  Always. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=137.8s)]
*  I talk to DeSantis calls me petrified that I would. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=138.8s)]
*  Now, we can't be sure. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  Sounds like Christie is talking about Nikki Haley in the she's going to get smoked, who, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  of course, has the wealthy donor class or some significant portion of it behind her, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=149.68s)]
*  along with Ron DeSantis, the former top challenger to Donald Trump now sitting in a very distant [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=154.52s)]
*  second place in Iowa, less than a week before the caucus. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  And after Chris Christie laid out the facts behind closed doors, he took to that stage [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=163.28s)]
*  in New Hampshire and basically repeated everything he said in private to the entire audience. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=167.16s)]
*  If Donald Trump becomes the nominee of this party, the moment that it happened was when [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=172.36s)]
*  Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott and Mike Pence and Doug Burgum and Vivek [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=184.16s)]
*  Rameswamy stood on that stage in Milwaukee in August. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  And when we were asked, would you support someone who is a convicted felon to be president [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=200.72s)]
*  of the United States? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=206.2s)]
*  They raised their hands. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=207.8s)]
*  They raised their hands. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=209.6s)]
*  And I did not and will not. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=212.56s)]
*  And I cannot countenance that behavior. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=216.96s)]
*  Anyone who is unwilling to say that he is unfit to be president of the United States [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  is unfit themselves to be president of the United States. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=229.44s)]
*  I want to promise you this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=233.12s)]
*  I am going to make sure that in no way do I enable Donald Trump to ever be president [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  of the United States again. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's more important than my own personal ambition. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=245.76s)]
*  Now, as Chris Christie bluntly describes, none of the remaining Republicans in the race [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  have taken a stand against the insurrectionist ex-president. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=254.76s)]
*  Christie was the only candidate in the Republican field stating the plain truth about Donald [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=258.44s)]
*  Trump and his total unfitness for office, along with, we should say, Issa Hutchinson, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=262.76s)]
*  who's still in the race, but not on the debate stage or anywhere close. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=266.28s)]
*  But he did not find an audience for that message. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=270.2s)]
*  No one has among the Republican primary voters. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  And again, to Christie's credit, he did not attempt to pander to the MAGA base. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=275.2s)]
*  He had a theory of the case. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=279.08s)]
*  He was going to go out, tell the truth about Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=280.4s)]
*  But as it turns out, pandering the MAGA base is kind of the name of the game in Republican [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=283.24s)]
*  politics right now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  The fundamental dynamic of the Trump era that created that base is this kind of transformation [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=290.52s)]
*  of the base of the party towards the discontented white working class, predominantly white voters, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=297.68s)]
*  white conservative voters without college degrees. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  And that base of the party as the kind of bedrock for electoral success in Republican [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  primaries has created a very weird dynamic. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=315.56s)]
*  And you see it everywhere. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=319.52s)]
*  What it has done is it made it increasingly difficult for Republican politicians who themselves [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=321.44s)]
*  are not part of that base to connect to their own voters. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=327.32s)]
*  So they're playing this kind of game of translation all the time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=332.08s)]
*  We see it play out all the time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=335.4s)]
*  It is a big part, I submit, of why Republican politicians in the Trump era sound so weirdly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=337.12s)]
*  cringey, like just off. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=345.6s)]
*  And you're like, what are you saying? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=348.4s)]
*  Here's the ultimate example, that guy, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=351.44s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=353.16s)]
*  So Florida governor, product of Harvard and Yale, some of the most elite institutions [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=354.16s)]
*  in American life, a kind of winner of the American meritocracy comes out on the top, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=357.96s)]
*  right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  A member of the very groups and institutions that the base absolutely despises. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  And they feel alienated and shut out from that world. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=368.24s)]
*  But culturally also, you know, that's the world that produced him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=371.2s)]
*  So when Ron DeSantis tries to relate to those voters, to tell them what he thinks they [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=374.92s)]
*  want to hear, well, it sounds like this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=379.6s)]
*  So because the woke represents a war on truth, we have no other recourse but to wage a war [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=384.36s)]
*  on woke. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=391.64s)]
*  We fight the woke in the schools. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=393.02000000000004s)]
*  We fight the woke in the legislature. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  We will fight the woke in education. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  We will fight the woke in the corporations. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=399.56s)]
*  We will fight the woke in the halls of Congress. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=401.64s)]
*  We will never, ever surrender to the woke mob. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=404.32s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=407.92s)]
*  If someone in the drug cartels is sneaking fentanyl across the border when I'm president, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=409.08s)]
*  that's going to be the last thing they do. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=413.4s)]
*  We're going to shoot them stone cold dead. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=414.88s)]
*  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=416.52s)]
*  This is your governor speaking. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=417.86s)]
*  Today's training evolution, dogfighting, taking on the corporate media. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=419.24s)]
*  The rules of engagement are as follows. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=423.96s)]
*  Number one, don't fire unless fired upon. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=426.8s)]
*  But when they fire, you fire back with overwhelming force. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=430.2s)]
*  I mean, we could have played you an hour of stuff that level. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=434.8s)]
*  OK, now, granted, DeSantis is probably the most extreme example of, again, this sort [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=438.52s)]
*  of dynamic in which you have Republican politicians who are products of the American elite, right, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=443.44s)]
*  embarrassingly trying to figure out how to talk to the MAGA base that's alienating from [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=448.64s)]
*  them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=453.76s)]
*  And it's the overarching dynamic of the entire party. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=454.76s)]
*  It explains a lot. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=457.12s)]
*  Like Nikki Haley, OK, she's the other one, right? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=458.92s)]

*  want to move past Trump. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=465.44s)]
*  And she knows how to talk to college educated wealthy conservatives in the Charleston suburbs, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=472.0s)]
*  She knows that vocabulary. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=473.0s)]
*  She knows that messaging. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=474.0s)]
*  She's good at it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=475.0s)]
*  She cannot speak in the register that Donald Trump can to his base. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=476.0s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  I'm an accountant. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=481.23999999999995s)]

*  The only thing Joe Biden needs to spend more of is more time in retirement. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=485.88s)]
*  He claimed I'm not in my prime. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=490.2s)]
*  In which I responded, hold my beer. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  Now this has been the problem for virtually every candidate in the Republican Party. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  So we got to just skate to where the puck is going, not just where the puck is. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=503.74s)]
*  Don't just build the wall. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=507.8s)]
*  Build both walls. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=508.96s)]
*  Can't just complete the wall. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=509.96s)]
*  Use the military to seal the Swiss cheese for the tunnels that they're actually building [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=511.48s)]
*  underneath that wall. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=515.04s)]
*  That's like Harvard section, dude. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=516.8s)]
*  Most of the time, you can go to a guy in your section who then uses his Ivy League [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=518.4s)]
*  connections to create a pharma investment that goes huge and makes a lot of money. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=521.64s)]

*  Tribune to the working class. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=529.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, the most extreme examples of this in the Republican Party actually come out of [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  Congress. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=533.72s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty common. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=534.72s)]
*  You've got people like, for instance, Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=535.72s)]
*  Their whole life now is like cosplaying as regular Joe's, cosplaying as the voters they're [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=538.4s)]
*  trying to channel. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=542.12s)]
*  Stanford and Yale law grad Hawley, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, infamously [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=544.04s)]
*  tried to show he stands with the MAGA mob on January 6, raising a fist to the crowd [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=548.16s)]
*  gathered at the Capitol. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=553.52s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=554.88s)]
*  But when the violent mob entered the building, Hawley, caught on surveillance cameras in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=556.24s)]
*  this video released by the January 6 committee, ran away from the base he appeared to support [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=559.88s)]
*  hours earlier. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=564.6s)]
*  Ted Cruz, a complete creature of the elite, the Ivy League, just he's the leader in this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=566.52s)]
*  field. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=571.88s)]
*  I mean, even better than DeSantis, just regularly putting on cringeworthy performances. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=572.88s)]
*  Left is so bad. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=578.52s)]
*  They're so unhappy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=580.12s)]
*  They're so pissed off. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=581.28s)]
*  And by the way, if you were a liberal woman and you had to sleep with those weenies, you'd [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  be pissed too. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=594.28s)]
*  Now these idiots have come out and said drink two beers a week. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=595.56s)]
*  That's their guideline. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=600.04s)]
*  Well, I got to tell you, if they want us to drink two beers a week, frankly, they can [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=601.04s)]
*  kiss my ass. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=604.92s)]
*  No. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=607.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=608.32s)]
*  Who's buying it? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=609.32s)]
*  I mean, honestly, like just politics aside, right? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=610.6s)]
*  Like substance aside. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=613.08s)]
*  Who is, I mean, who is buying that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  That is how they think these people want to be talked to. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  In the end, no one in the Republican Party has figured out how to talk to the base, well, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=622.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's base, except for Donald Trump. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=627.44s)]
*  And that's a whole other topic for another day. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  I think partly his ability to do it is born of his cellular authentic sense of grievance. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=632.92s)]
*  They're just absolutely just resentment driving his personal being on the planet from the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=639.92s)]
*  moment he was a child. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=647.68s)]
*  And there's something about that that's like genuinely authentic they like. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=649.12s)]
*  And through that, the ex-president effortlessly does connect with the group. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=653.12s)]
*  The entire structure of the party is centered around the group that he can talk to. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=656.8s)]
*  That is why we are where we are now, with less than a week to go before the first votes [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=660.44s)]
*  of 2024 are cast. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=664.36s)]
*  Amanda Carpenter is a writer and editor at the nonprofit anti-authoritarianism group [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=666.84s)]

*  Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist in the New York Times. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=676.12s)]
*  His latest piece is titled Imagine If Trump Loses. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=678.96s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=681.6s)]
*  First, let's just start with each of you, the development of Christie dropping out on [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=682.6s)]
*  what it means. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=686.84s)]
*  Amanda, let me start with you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=687.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, I kind of see a thread. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, I sort of laughing at some of those clips you played. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  And I just want to make it clear, I'm a proud Midwest school graduate and I was not Ted [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=694.52s)]
*  Cruz's communication director when he was speaking MAGA like that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=698.6s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=702.12s)]
*  Why do they do that? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=703.64s)]
*  And this has kind of been the whole story throughout Trump. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=704.64s)]
*  Like, why do these smart, educated people go along with this nonsense? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  And what Chris Christie said in his speech today, where he had the moment where he said, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=711.32s)]
*  I did these things in 2016 and all the way, you know, for many years after because I put [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=715.4s)]
*  ambition ahead of decision making. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=721.4s)]
*  And that just clicked a lot of things into place for me because we all sort of know this. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=724.28s)]
*  But you see this so many times. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=728.52s)]
*  All these politicians put their ambition ahead of rational decision making when they know [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=730.6s)]
*  better, when they know that they are parodying this kind of MAGA silly speech. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=736.68s)]
*  They know it sounds cringe, but they think that is what will get them ahead. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=741.72s)]
*  They think that is what voters want to hear. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=745.56s)]
*  And the reason it doesn't work because that is not actually genuine to who they are and what [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=747.96s)]
*  they think internally in their past experiences. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=752.28s)]
*  But they just see this as a shortcut. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=755.24s)]
*  This is how I speak to the MAGA base. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=757.16s)]
*  Instead of actually doing the work of how we create a better political system or their [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=759.56s)]
*  own agenda or how we actually have an enduring coalition, they don't want to put in the work [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=763.96s)]
*  because they are scared of the base, they are scared of the backlash and they don't [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=770.52s)]
*  actually understand their own voters. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=774.84s)]
*  Yeah, that is the key. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=776.84s)]
*  They are scared of them and they also don't understand them, which I think is honestly a [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=777.48s)]
*  really important dynamic here taking shape in this primary. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=780.52s)]
*  And, you know, Jamila, I was thinking about this in the context of democratic politics, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=782.92s)]
*  which I know better and have sort of covered more closely in some ways. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=785.8s)]
*  This happens all the time because the Democrats are a very heterogeneous coalition, right? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=789.4s)]
*  So you have got like old white politicians who go to like, you know, barbecues in black [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=793.96s)]
*  neighborhoods in urban environments and black churches where they have to do a little bit of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=799.8s)]
*  code switching and sometimes it gets real cringy or you've got the Senate candidates who's like, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=803.0s)]
*  como estamos, you know, when they show up at like, you know, an event for Latinos. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=808.12s)]
*  That is part of politics is doing that stuff. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=813.4799999999999s)]
*  But there is at least an authentic connection to black voters, to Latino voters, to different [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  kinds of voters in the fabric of the coalition, the Democratic Party. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=822.3599999999999s)]
*  I think it's just missing peace in Republican politics right now. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=825.72s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=832.28s)]
*  I think also one of the key differences between the two parties coalitions is that the Democratic [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=833.1600000000001s)]
*  Party coalition is very much you might call like a brokerage party, right? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  Like it's various groups of policy demanders, use of political science each term, like trying [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=841.32s)]
*  to get something out of the government. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=846.84s)]
*  And each of the coalition partners are working with each other, understanding that they're [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=849.08s)]
*  obviously negotiating and there's conflict on these things, but there's something substantive [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=854.28s)]
*  at the end of the day that say black voters want, that Latino voters want, that civil [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=858.36s)]
*  rights groups want, that LGBT groups want. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=863.0s)]
*  They want something concrete from the federal state. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=865.4s)]
*  The Republican coalition is very different and especially under Trump, it's much less [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=868.92s)]
*  of that kind of group of policy demanders. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=874.04s)]
*  I mean, there are policies that people want, but what the voters seem to want more than [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  anything is for a candidate to reflect back onto them, their sense of grievance, right? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=881.4s)]
*  And so Trump, because he, as you mentioned, as you said, has this very authentic grievance [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=887.4s)]
*  about him. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=892.36s)]
*  He can do that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=893.16s)]
*  He's also a longtime celebrity and show him and he has those skills. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  Other regular Republican politicians have a very difficult time with this because it [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=897.72s)]
*  just isn't their experience and they don't really know what else to do in terms of appealing [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=902.04s)]
*  to these voters. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=907.96s)]
*  It is not lost on me that the Republican politicians who have done best in terms of the connection [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=908.68s)]
*  with voters in the Trump era are people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was like an influencer [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=914.4399999999999s)]
*  beforehand and kind of has that kind of like grasping sense of I want it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=920.5999999999999s)]
*  Kerry Lake in Arizona, I think, really connects to these people for similar reasons. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=924.8399999999999s)]
*  But if you're like an Ivy League guy who, you know, you're just kind of putting on a [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  role, it's really hard to reflect that back at someone. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=935.32s)]
*  Easier to say, I will, if you elect me, I'll do these things for you and we can build our [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=938.7600000000001s)]
*  connection this way. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=943.24s)]
*  Much harder to say, if you elect me, I'll be your avatar of rage. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=944.12s)]
*  Like, no one's buying that from Ted Cruz or Josh Hawley. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=948.36s)]
*  Yeah, that is extremely well put. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=951.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we should say the polling here just to sort of give the kind of top lines right [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=953.0s)]
*  now. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=957.08s)]
*  Like, again, in New Hampshire, where you have unaffiliated voters, Democrats and independents [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=957.32s)]
*  all can vote, right? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=961.8800000000001s)]
*  The latest poll had Trump up by seven over Haley. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=963.48s)]
*  Christie was taking 12 points. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=966.1999999999999s)]
*  It's possible him leaving helps Haley there. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=967.9599999999999s)]
*  If you look at the sort of national polling, it's still just an enormous Donald Trump. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=973.0799999999999s)]
*  He's got 49 and no one's even really closing Chris Christie's at 2%, which, again, Amanda, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=977.64s)]
*  Christie at least had a theory of the case, right? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=984.92s)]
*  I'm going to get in the race. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to be the Trump is bad actually candidate. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=987.88s)]
*  And I'm just going to say that until to see how far it takes me. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=992.12s)]
*  And it does feel like today was a definitive ruling on that approach, at least within a [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=995.64s)]
*  Republican primaries, which we all know. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1000.52s)]
*  But I'm glad he gave it a try, I guess is what I would say. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1002.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it's important to test the case. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1006.04s)]
*  And with him dropping out, there's enough voters there to make it interesting for Haley [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1007.96s)]
*  in New Hampshire. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1012.04s)]
*  But the next logical question is, what does Christie do next? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1012.76s)]
*  I want to tamp down on this push, be like, oh, now he needs to go out and be a surrogate [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1017.48s)]
*  for Biden. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1022.0400000000001s)]
*  Now he immediately needs to get a slot at the DNC. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1022.6s)]
*  Chris Christie speaking to Republicans and saying why Donald Trump is unfit is very [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1026.3600000000001s)]
*  important. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1032.6000000000001s)]
*  And the second that he sort of becomes a Democrat, he's going to lose that credibility. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1033.16s)]
*  And so maybe he does endorse Biden later. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1037.0s)]
*  But I don't think there should be a rush to do that yet, because we need this sort of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1039.08s)]
*  civics education. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1043.0s)]
*  We wonder, why do Republican voters think the way they do? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1044.2s)]
*  Why do they support Trump? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1046.92s)]
*  There's this self-fulfilling doom loop where Trump tells them something, his mega media [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1047.96s)]
*  echoes it, all the go-long politicians like the Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, repeat it and give [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1052.44s)]
*  cover to it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1056.92s)]
*  The voters get it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1057.72s)]
*  And then they reflect it back to everybody. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1058.68s)]
*  And on and on it goes. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1060.2s)]
*  So if Chris Christie can try to get in there a little bit and talk over the next few months [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1061.32s)]
*  about like, hey, maybe this is why presidential immunity matters. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1066.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1071.0800000000002s)]
*  Something like that going on with the courts. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1071.64s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1073.56s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1074.28s)]
*  And, Jamel, I think part of it is that Trump is one of his skills. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1075.1599999999999s)]
*  And I don't know how intentional it is. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1078.28s)]
*  He is polarizing, you know, intentionally. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1080.12s)]
*  It's a which side are you on kind of situation. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
*  It's a wedge he's driving all the time. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1084.6s)]
*  And so you can't—what we've seen in this primary is you can't be kind of like noncomittal [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1087.0s)]
*  on him, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  So—and so once someone is a never-Trump-er, then they can be safely discarded inside the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1092.04s)]
*  universe that Amanda's talking about. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1098.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1102.04s)]
*  I don't think—so I'm going to disagree a little bit with Amanda here and say that [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1102.28s)]
*  insofar that the goal is to maybe persuade like hardcore Republican voters, I'm not sure [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1107.56s)]
*  Chris Christie can do this exactly for the reason you mentioned, Chris, for this dynamic, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1111.72s)]
*  that the moment he begins speaking openly against Trump, there is a mental model to put [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1115.96s)]
*  him in. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1121.48s)]
*  He is a never-Trump-er. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1121.8799999999999s)]
*  We don't listen to him. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1122.84s)]
*  But the universe of voters and voters who might even vote for Republicans, it's much [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1123.96s)]
*  broader than just people who vote in Republican primaries, right? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1128.52s)]
*  There are many, many voters who may consider voting for Trump in this election. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1131.24s)]
*  And I think Christie, if he's going to be strategic about this, is best situated speaking [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1136.36s)]
*  to those people, right? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1141.0s)]
*  Like, people who aren't—you know, they aren't following politics closely. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1142.2s)]
*  They maybe voted for Biden. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1146.52s)]
*  Maybe they didn't vote. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1147.96s)]
*  They may be thinking about Trump this time because they sense that, you know, I think [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1149.08s)]
*  that'd be a better option. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1152.92s)]
*  And Christie can say to them, listen, I'm a Republican. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  I understand this feeling. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1157.24s)]
*  I don't like Biden either. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1159.0s)]
*  But this is not the time to make that choice. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1160.28s)]
*  I agree. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1162.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  We don't need so many Republicans that turn into Democrats. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1162.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1165.64s)]
*  A long, durable, pro-democracy coalition of Republicans and Democrats who can disagree [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1166.04s)]
*  and make—you know, fight for the policies on the merits in a safe and fair and free way. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1172.44s)]
*  Amanda Carpenter, Jamel Bowie, thank you both. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1177.32s)]
*  Coming up with no real goals besides groveling before Donald Trump, House Republicans are [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1181.0s)]
*  flailing again. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1185.0s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett joins me on today's MAGA Chaos. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1185.96s)]
*  Ahead. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1189.32s)]
*  Congress has rung in 2024, the new session, and when House Republicans are in session, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1193.56s)]
*  there are two things you can pretty much count on. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1197.3999999999999s)]
*  One, they're not doing much legislating. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1199.8s)]
*  And two, they are creating incredibly embarrassing spectacles. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1201.72s)]
*  Although there is a little bit of movement on the legislative part. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1205.0s)]
*  You know, Congress, of course, constitutionally required to fund the U.S. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1208.28s)]
*  government. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1210.84s)]
*  And with the budget deadline in nine days and the threat of yet another government shutdown [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1211.48s)]
*  looming, there's some good news, which is that it looks like they've hammered out a [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1215.4s)]
*  spending deal that is agreeable to the top leaders in both parties. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1219.5600000000002s)]
*  Naturally, that has, predictably, enraged the far-right conservatives in the House Freedom [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1222.92s)]
*  Caucus who once again feel sold out. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1227.5600000000002s)]
*  Like Texas Republican Chip Roy, who's even raised the possibility of a motion to vacate [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1230.1200000000001s)]
*  the House speakership. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1234.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes, to unseat his own new Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, a guy who took over after far-right [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1235.96s)]
*  Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, for basically the exact same thing, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1241.56s)]
*  keeping the government running, actually getting a deal done. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1245.8799999999999s)]
*  And who knows, maybe we'll burn through half a dozen Republican House speakers before [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1249.48s)]
*  Election Day. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1253.24s)]
*  Now, it's absurd in no small part because the Republican Party's problems don't have anything [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1254.52s)]
*  to do with Mike Johnson personally. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1258.76s)]
*  They are about the nature of the Republican Party at this moment. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1260.28s)]
*  The party has basically retreated from any actual policy agenda on the many issues and problems [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1264.12s)]
*  that face the nation and that government exists to address. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1269.88s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1273.3200000000002s)]
*  People are angry about grocery prices. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1274.0400000000002s)]
*  Understandably, they've been high. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1276.44s)]
*  What is the Republican plan to lower grocery store prices? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1278.6000000000001s)]
*  I genuinely have no idea. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1283.24s)]
*  I could not possibly even begin to tell you, and I do this for a living. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1284.7600000000002s)]
*  They're not talking about that or any other substantive policy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1288.0400000000002s)]
*  Of course, there is one exception. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1291.16s)]
*  There's one thing they will talk about, which is the border. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1292.44s)]
*  They will hold press conferences there. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1295.96s)]
*  They will entertain plans to essentially end the American system of asylum as we know it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1297.72s)]
*  They will demand more money to build Trump's wall. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1301.88s)]
*  They will threaten to sink budget deals and risk government shutdowns or any other nonrelated [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1304.52s)]

*  The context for that particular spectacle is amazing. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1453.72s)]
*  Republicans talked about Hunter Biden, they trashed Hunter Biden, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  they ultimately voted right down party lines to recommend the House hold him in contempt [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1458.68s)]

*  All while Hunter Biden was sitting there, ready to talk then and there, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1467.8s)]
*  basically calling their bluff and not being listened to. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1472.1999999999998s)]
*  And Democrats noticed. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1475.48s)]
*  So why are we here? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1477.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump insisted to numerous Republicans and in public and on Twitter [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1479.08s)]
*  and on Truth Social that Joe Biden be impeached. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1485.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1488.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, because Donald Trump was impeached twice. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1489.48s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1491.96s)]
*  I know obviously what we're seeing today has been quite insane. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1492.76s)]
*  We've seen pornographic images, we've talked about white privilege, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1496.1200000000001s)]
*  but we haven't seen any sort of evidence linking President Biden to any sort of wrongdoing. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1499.72s)]
*  And let me tell you why nobody wants to talk to y'all behind closed doors, because y'all lie. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  That's just the bottom line. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1510.6000000000001s)]
*  You have done it thus far in this investigation. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1512.04s)]
*  You have done it this far as it relates to this committee and every single hearing, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1514.68s)]
*  y'all spin, spin, spin. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1519.4s)]
*  I don't know how y'all are still standing right now. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1520.84s)]
*  That was Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett laying into Republicans [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1524.1999999999998s)]
*  for this particular substance free spectacle. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1527.56s)]
*  And she will join me just after the break. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1530.28s)]
*  Congress has rung in 2024, the new session, and when House Republicans are in session, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1536.04s)]
*  there are two things you can pretty much count on. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1539.8799999999999s)]
*  One, they're not doing much legislating and two, they are creating incredibly [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1542.28s)]
*  embarrassing spectacles, although there is a little bit of movement on the legislative part. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1546.36s)]
*  Congress, of course, constitutionally required to fund the US government. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1551.0s)]
*  And with the budget deadline in nine days and the threat of yet another government shutdown looming, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1553.9599999999998s)]
*  there's some good news, which is that it looks like they've hammered out a spending [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1558.4399999999998s)]
*  deal that is agreeable to the top leaders in both parties. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1562.4399999999998s)]
*  Naturally, that has predictably enraged the far-right conservatives in the House [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1565.32s)]
*  Freedom Caucus who once again feel sold out, like Texas Republican Chip Roy, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1569.3999999999999s)]
*  who's even raised the possibility of a motion to vacate the House speakership. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1574.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes, to unseat his own new Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, a guy who took over after far-right [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1578.44s)]
*  Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, for basically the exact same thing, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1584.04s)]
*  keeping the government running, actually getting a deal done. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1588.28s)]
*  And who knows, maybe we'll burn through half a dozen Republican House speakers before election day. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1591.88s)]
*  Now, it's absurd in no small part because the Republican Party's problems don't have anything [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1597.0s)]
*  to do with Mike Johnson personally. They are about the nature of the Republican Party at this moment. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1601.24s)]
*  The party has basically retreated from any actual policy agenda on the many issues and problems [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1606.52s)]
*  that face the nation and that government exists to address. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1612.28s)]
*  Here's one example. People are angry about grocery prices. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1615.8s)]
*  Understandably, they've been high. What is the Republican plan to lower [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1618.84s)]
*  grocery store prices? I genuinely have no idea. I could not possibly even begin to tell you, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1623.8s)]
*  and I do this for a living. They're not talking about that or any other substantive policy. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1629.32s)]
*  Of course, there is one exception. There's one thing they will talk about, which is the border. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1633.64s)]
*  They will hold press conferences there. They will entertain plans to essentially end the American [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1638.44s)]
*  system of asylum as we know it. They will demand more money to build Trump's wall. They will [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1643.0s)]
*  threaten to sink budget deals and risk government shutdowns or any other nonrelated stuff just to [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1647.32s)]
*  put more money and guns on the border. And as much as I find all of that odious, it is at least, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1653.72s)]
*  I have to say, recognizable as a policy position. Okay, fine. They want to beef up security at the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1660.76s)]
*  border and end asylum. Once you get past the border as Republican issue number one, what's number two? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1666.36s)]
*  Go ahead. What can you name? Attacking trans healthcare? Ending aid to Ukraine? Maybe? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1673.64s)]
*  I mean, that's it. Just an enormous vacuum on everything else, all the other things one might [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1681.4s)]
*  have politics and positions about. There is not even a story they have to tell about the great [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1688.12s)]
*  issues of the day that America faces. There's no policy prescriptions. There's no debates about [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1693.08s)]

*  hold him in contempt for not talking to them behind closed doors, even though he offered to [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1804.2s)]
*  testify in public. All while Hunter Biden was sitting there, ready to talk then and there, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1808.12s)]
*  basically calling their bluff and not being listened to. And Democrats noticed. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1814.68s)]
*  So why are we here? Well, Donald Trump insisted to numerous Republicans and in public and on Twitter [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1820.36s)]
*  and on truth social that Joe Biden be impeached. Why? Well, because Donald Trump was impeached [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1827.64s)]
*  twice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know obviously what we're seeing today has been quite insane. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1833.96s)]
*  We've seen pornographic images. We've talked about white privilege, but we haven't seen any sort of [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1838.6000000000001s)]
*  evidence linking President Biden to any sort of wrongdoing. And let me tell you why nobody wants [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1843.96s)]
*  to talk to y'all behind closed doors, because y'all lie. That's just the bottom line. You have done it [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1850.44s)]
*  thus far in this investigation. You have done it this far as it relates to this committee and every [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1855.4s)]
*  single hearing y'all spin, spin, spin. I don't know how y'all are still standing right now. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1860.92s)]
*  That was Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett laying into Republicans [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1866.6000000000001s)]
*  for this particular Substance Theory spectacle. And she will join me just after the break. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1870.0400000000002s)]
*  Something most people suspected is now official. 2023 was the hottest year on record and not just [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1877.96s)]
*  by a hair. Take a look at this staggering chart showing the monthly global temperature compared [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1884.44s)]
*  with pre-industrial levels. That thick orange line at the very tippy, tippy top is 2023. The rest of [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1889.64s)]
*  the lines are every other year since 1940. Last year just absolutely smashed the record. According [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1896.8400000000001s)]
*  to the director of the European Union's climate change service, 2023 appears to be among the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1904.8400000000001s)]
*  warmest at least 100,000 years. Quote, there were simply no cities, no books, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1909.48s)]
*  agriculture or domesticated animals on this planet the last time the temperature was so high. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1916.8400000000001s)]
*  Think about that. We are at the point, almost, we're at it that scientists warned us about, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1923.5600000000002s)]
*  the point where we had hope to cap warming at this limit that we're at. And this year is likely to be [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1929.4s)]
*  even hotter. Now, this is obviously terrifying and sort of panic inducing. But I will say there's [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1935.64s)]
*  another piece of climate news. 2023 was the hottest year on record, but it was also the first year [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1941.72s)]
*  since the pandemic that U.S. emissions declined while the economy grew. You can see GDP growth in [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1946.92s)]
*  green, emissions in blue on this chart. Over there on the right, that's 2023. One goes up, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1954.44s)]
*  one goes down. That's what you want to see. And even better, last year's emissions were [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1959.3200000000002s)]
*  2% below what was expected based on the baseline rate of decline between 2011 and 2019, meaning [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1965.16s)]
*  we're declining faster. According to analysts, it suggests an acceleration in the pace of American [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1972.1200000000001s)]
*  decarbonization. It is, I will caution, still not enough to meet our emissions targets under the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1977.72s)]
*  pious climate accords. But we're heading in the right direction and maybe getting better at doing [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1982.8400000000001s)]
*  it. That shift in emissions is part of what I got the chance to explore on my podcast, Why Is This [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1988.0400000000002s)]
*  Happening, which you can find by scanning the QR code you see there on your screen. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1993.8799999999999s)]
*  In this week's episode, I spoke with one of my favorite climate journalist, Robinson Meyer. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  He's founder of a great climate publication called Heatmap about the year and climate, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2003.48s)]
*  the recent inflection points on emissions, the future of clean energy. Here's a part of [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2007.8s)]
*  that conversation. Over the past 10 years in the U.S., we used to think the power sector was really, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2011.6399999999999s)]
*  really hard. The power sector was the biggest source of emissions in the U.S. Then cheap wind [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2018.76s)]
*  and solar happened and very rapidly, and we switched, frankly, from coal to natural gas through [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2025.0s)]
*  a lot of the country, and very rapidly, power sector emissions fell. And then kind of the [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2029.64s)]
*  big world of climate people started looking at transportation, and then EV prices fell. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2036.44s)]
*  Transportation became the most polluting sector of the U.S. economy. Well, what's about to happen [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2042.44s)]
*  in the next few years is that transportation's going to fall to second place, and industry [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2048.2000000000003s)]
*  will be the most polluting sector of the economy. And what I suspect will happen is that just as [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2056.28s)]
*  happened with the power sector, just as happened with the transportation sector, once industry is [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2061.4s)]
*  the most polluting sector of the economy and people really start to focus on it, we're going [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2066.76s)]
*  to see all these easy-to-abate emissions that we just haven't really noticed yet, and we're going [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2071.56s)]
*  to get rid of them really quickly. That is optimistic, and it's really important on this [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2077.0s)]
*  topic to resist doom. What you can do if you listen to that full episode right now, scan the [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2081.0s)]
*  QR code on your screen or you just search, why is this happening, wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2085.48s)]
*  We are now awaiting a decision any day, any moment from the D.C. Court of Appeals on whether Donald [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2093.8s)]
*  Trump is immune, as he claims, from criminal charges for attempting to overturn the election. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2098.2s)]
*  Yesterday's hearing on this, the three judges in the panel certainly seem skeptical. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2103.24s)]
*  Conservative attorney George Conway, who was in that courtroom, points out that Trump's lawyers [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2108.04s)]
*  had a difficult case to begin with because their position is clearly not correct under either [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2112.8399999999997s)]
*  precedent or the Constitution, but in making the arguments they had, they also fell into a trap. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2117.4s)]
*  It happened when one judge, Florence Pan, pressed Trump's lawyers on the implications of his argument. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2123.08s)]
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival who was not impeached, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2128.68s)]
*  would he be subject to criminal prosecution? If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2136.68s)]
*  In response to that moment, Conway writes, quote, the damage was done and Pan's point was [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2142.8399999999997s)]
*  devastatingly made. On the one hand, Trump's lawyer argued the Constitution gave the president [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2147.56s)]
*  absolute immunity for his official acts. On the other hand, if the United States Congress [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2152.3599999999997s)]
*  effectively gives permission by impeaching and convicting, well then yes, a president can be [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2156.12s)]
*  prosecuted and wait for it, he's not absolutely immune. George Conway joins me now, he's a [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2160.2s)]
*  contributing writer for The Atlantic. So I found your argument here interesting and it was not the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2165.7999999999997s)]
*  way, it didn't dawn on me in the same way that it did to you, that moment. And I want you to [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2172.2s)]
*  explain why that, and Judge Pan was very focused on it, she kept coming at it again and again and [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2177.64s)]
*  again. Why that moment was so important for his Trump's argument sort of collapsing? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2184.04s)]
*  Well, there are a couple of reasons for that. I mean, first of all, I mean, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2191.88s)]
*  Judge Pan was trying to do two things as I see it. One was she was trying to elicit a concession from [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2195.96s)]
*  Trump's counsel that, no, that his position was extreme. And at the same time, when Trump's [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2203.96s)]
*  counsel resisted saying that yes, a president is absolutely immune for, you know, for sending in [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2209.88s)]
*  SEAL Team 6, she then sort of went to the underbelly of the argument that he was making as to why it [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2219.0s)]
*  wasn't always the case, which was this argument based upon the secondary provision that Trump [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2227.48s)]
*  relies on, which is the impeachment judgment clause, which says that you can prosecute somebody [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2233.64s)]
*  criminally after you impeach and remove them through Congress. And her point really was that [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2240.2799999999997s)]
*  there was a tension between those two positions. In addition to the fact that the position he was [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2247.0s)]
*  taking was extreme under one clause, the second clause, I mean, the second provision, which is the [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2251.8799999999997s)]
*  impeachment judgment provision, basically undercuts the absolute immunity claim because it makes [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2257.56s)]
*  clear that office holders, and it doesn't exclude the president, can be prosecuted after being [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2263.32s)]
*  removed from office. And so she kept drilling on that. And then she makes the point that, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2268.76s)]
*  okay, well, if you're saying that he can be prosecuted under some circumstances when Congress [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2274.6000000000004s)]
*  does impeach and convict and remove a president, you're not saying he's absolutely immune. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2280.2000000000003s)]
*  And so that's the reason why Trump's position collapsed was it was not only was it extreme, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2286.6800000000003s)]
*  but it was at war with itself. And when you get that kind of, and the other thing that made it [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2296.1200000000003s)]
*  worse for Trump's lawyer is when you're going to have to make a concession to a judge who is very [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2302.76s)]
*  smart and is not going to let things go, you make the concession. You say, yes, that's, I mean, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2310.28s)]
*  because it is their position that a president who's not impeached and removed can get away with [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2316.12s)]
*  anything. It has to be their position because there's not much worse other than perhaps sending [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2321.3199999999997s)]
*  SEAL Team Six to the Capitol than what he did. So you have, you know, sometimes you just have to [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2325.96s)]
*  accept the fact that your position is out there because it's the only one you can take. Now it's [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2332.6s)]
*  a loser to be sure, but you do not make a weak argument stronger by blending it with an even [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2337.0s)]
*  weaker one. That is appellate advocacy 101 in addition to, you know, answer the questions. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2343.16s)]
*  So that's such an interesting and I think really important point. I just want to stay with it for [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2349.96s)]
*  a second because I think it's key. I mean, the opening bid right from Trump's lawyers is he is [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2353.16s)]
*  absolutely immune for official acts at the outer perimeter of his official duties. And that means [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2357.7999999999997s)]
*  anything from sending SEAL Team Six as Jack Smith's office, I think smartly sort of raised to selling [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2363.72s)]
*  pardons. These are clearly, we would say, criminal enterprises, but they're they intermix with [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2369.32s)]
*  official acts. And what you're saying is rather what they realized, I think, is that that was too [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2375.1600000000003s)]
*  extreme and they needed a fallback. So they've concocted this sort of, you know, for FACACTA [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2380.36s)]
*  construction, which is like this weird impeachment thing. And you're saying by constructing the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2392.6000000000004s)]
*  fallback so that you're not making the extreme argument, you're also undercutting the clarity of [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2398.52s)]
*  the argument itself. That's exactly right. And it goes even beyond the fact that it's that the [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2403.48s)]
*  impeachment judgment clause is inconsistent with absolute presidential criminal immunity. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2408.68s)]
*  The rationales that he was presenting were inconsistent. His rationale that he kept [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2417.16s)]
*  repeating to the panel, Sauer, Trump's lawyer, he kept saying the reason why we have to have [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2424.2s)]
*  absolute criminal immunity is because of the specter that some other president, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2432.2s)]
*  his client, actually, might go and start prosecuting, engaging in political prosecutions [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2437.96s)]
*  to punish his enemies. OK, well, that's OK. That's that's not a crazy argument. We don't want [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2443.7999999999997s)]
*  political prosecutions of politicians for simply doing their jobs. On the other hand, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2449.24s)]
*  the argument that he said that, well, you can prosecute a president when the Congress of the [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2455.64s)]
*  United States says you can. And excuse me, that that that's the most political spot in the universe [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2461.0s)]
*  right there. Right. Exactly. Right. Come on. So his argument made no sense on many levels. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2468.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that is a really, really excellent point. I was very. Thank you for the backdrop. It really [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2474.6s)]
*  helped. Yeah, that's it. Well, we do. We can't George Conway, who was in that room, who himself [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igkc6DJrBGk&t=2478.84s)]
