# ‘Chilling’: Hayes on why the fate of Kilmar Abrego Garcia matters to us all
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, President Trump does more talking than any president I've ever seen. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=2.0s)]
*  I mean, he's on TV more than I am, and I host an actual TV show. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=5.0s)]
*  Five days a week, he's got the makeup on and the cameras are rolling. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=9.0s)]
*  Today, he talked for half an hour at a awards ceremony for the Naval Academy football team. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=13.0s)]
*  He talks a lot. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=18.0s)]
*  But if you listen to him, you might notice what he almost never talks about. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=20.0s)]
*  And it's weird because he's a Republican, and they usually love talking about freedom. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=23.0s)]
*  Not Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=28.0s)]
*  Never really talks about freedom or liberty. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=29.0s)]
*  I mean, sure, he does use the words. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=32.0s)]
*  Like, for instance, last week, he signed the executive order on water pressure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=33.0s)]
*  He said it is to, quote, restore shower freedom. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=38.0s)]
*  So you get a lot of that, shower freedom. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=41.0s)]
*  But you never really hear him talk about freedom and liberty in any meaningful way, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=44.0s)]
*  like as the ideals this country was supposedly built upon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=48.0s)]
*  And it's because those ideals are just not meaningful at all to Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=52.0s)]
*  He doesn't really even care for freedom, not for other people, for sure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=56.0s)]
*  If anything has been brought into very sharp focus in these first 85 days, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=60.0s)]
*  particularly in just the last 24 hours, it is that Donald Trump is acting as an enemy of freedom. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=64.0s)]
*  His administration is working to take away the liberties at the core of the American experiment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=70.0s)]
*  He's waging an assault on freedom and liberty in almost any sphere he can. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=76.0s)]
*  In a couple of months, we have become a country where people are just being grabbed off the street, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=80.0s)]
*  accused of crimes, and then sent to a foreign gulag without any American freedom stuff, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=84.0s)]
*  like due process or evidence or even charges. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=89.0s)]
*  The most egregious, chilling example, of course, is that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=93.0s)]
*  who first came to the U.S. in 2011 as an undocumented 16-year-old [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=97.0s)]
*  sent by his mother because he had been pressured to join a violent gang in his native El Salvador. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=101.0s)]
*  In 2019, you'll recall that was during the first Trump administration, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=107.0s)]
*  an immigration judge gave Garcia a protected immigration status saying his life would be in danger [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=111.0s)]
*  if he were forced to return to El Salvador. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=116.0s)]
*  And since then, Garcia has lived and worked here legally. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=118.0s)]
*  He married an American woman. They started a family together in Maryland. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=122.0s)]
*  Last month, after picking up his five-year-old son, who has special needs, Garcia was grabbed by ICE. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=126.0s)]
*  And then within days, they had shipped Garcia off to CICOT, the Salvadoran gulag, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=133.0s)]
*  along with hundreds of others, caught in Trump's roundup. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=137.0s)]
*  Now, he's never been charged with any crime. ICE has maintained he's a member of the MS-13 gang, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=140.0s)]
*  but they've offered no proof in any court. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=145.0s)]
*  He and his family says he has no ties to any gang. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=147.0s)]
*  And that family, left to wonder now, will they ever see him again? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=150.0s)]
*  I will not stop fighting until I see my husband alive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=158.0s)]
*  Kielmar, if you can hear me, stay strong. God hasn't forgotten about you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=163.0s)]
*  Our children are asking, when would you come home? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=175.0s)]
*  And I pray for the day I tell them the time and date that you'll return. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=181.0s)]
*  Close your eyes and listen to that tape, and it sounds like a woman whose husband's been taken hostage, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=186.0s)]
*  begging the kidnappers to show mercy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=192.0s)]
*  An American woman. An American family. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=195.0s)]
*  In fact, Kielmar Abrego-Garcia was also an apprentice in the American building trades. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=198.0s)]
*  This was his American union president last week. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=203.0s)]
*  You want to build a $5 billion data center? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=208.0s)]
*  What more six fill your careers with health care retirement and no college debt? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=211.0s)]
*  You don't call Elon Musk. You call us! [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=215.0s)]
*  North America's building trade unions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=220.0s)]
*  And yeah, that means all of us. All of us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=224.0s)]
*  Including our brother, smart apprentice, Kielmar Abrego-Garcia, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=228.0s)]
*  Bring him home! [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=237.0s)]
*  All of us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=239.0s)]
*  All of us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=245.0s)]
*  In the U.S. District Court today in Maryland, Judge Paul Azines wanted to know what, if anything, the government was doing to bring him home, pursuant to the order from the Supreme Court, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=247.0s)]
*  Requiring the government to facilitate his release from that prison in El Salvador. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=257.0s)]
*  And the government's answer is... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=261.0s)]
*  Bah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=263.0s)]
*  It's El Salvador's problem now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=266.0s)]
*  Zinnis was not buying that and has tonight ordered depositions of four high-ranking Homeland Security officials. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=268.0s)]
*  She says holding Trump officials in contempt is not off the table. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=275.0s)]
*  Now, we don't know what's going to happen here. It's not all clear the Trump administration will comply. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=279.0s)]
*  They haven't so far. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=283.0s)]
*  They seem full speed ahead on expanding this obviously illegal non-constitutional operation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=285.0s)]
*  In fact, as we all heard yesterday, the Trump administration is quite openly talking about sending American citizens to the overseas gulag. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=290.0s)]
*  The home-gromes, Trump called them yesterday, American citizens. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=300.0s)]
*  Is that legal to do? Is that something you're allowed to do? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=305.0s)]
*  Well, Jesse, these are Americans who he is saying who have committed the most heinous crimes in our country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=309.0s)]
*  And crime is going to decrease dramatically because he has given us a directive to make America safe again. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=316.0s)]
*  Well, the short answer is no, it's not something you're allowed to do. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=323.0s)]
*  That's the Attorney General of the United States. Is that something you're allowed to do? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=327.0s)]
*  Well, it depends on who's allowing it, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=330.0s)]
*  Are you allowed to do that? Well, you're not, but the Constitution. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=332.0s)]
*  What's happening here, particularly with these renderings to this sort of third state gulag, right, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=335.0s)]
*  is I have to say already the most egregious assault on personal liberty that I've seen in my American political life. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=345.0s)]
*  I mean, in my lifetime, it's not really even that close. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=352.0s)]
*  I mean, Guantanamo was really bad. But again, Guantanamo was plausibly part of the American judicial system, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=354.0s)]
*  This is intentionally outside the orbit of our laws. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=361.0s)]
*  And it's just part of the effort to dominate every single independent aspect of American life. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=366.0s)]
*  A sort of full spectrum assault on American liberty. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=372.0s)]
*  All sorts of institutions, free institutions that do their own thing because we're a free country, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=376.0s)]
*  like colleges where a government task force, most of whose members' names are kept secret due to security concerns, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=381.0s)]
*  is demanding that research universities essentially install political commissars in academic departments [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=386.0s)]
*  and make hiring and admissions decisions so that they are more favorable to MAGA for viewpoint diversity. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=394.0s)]
*  You may have seen Harvard University said, no, no free society can tolerate this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=403.0s)]
*  No free institution can. And in return, the Trump administration announced they would freeze more than $2 billion in federal grants to the university [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=409.0s)]
*  because they want to coerce their freedom of speech and association. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=415.0s)]
*  But more colleges are already joining Harvard in resisting the government. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=419.0s)]
*  And that is a welcome sign. People and institutions coming together to fight for actual freedom against a president who hates it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=423.0s)]
*  Who hates our freedom of speech that enables critics. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=432.0s)]
*  So he attacks students exercising that speech and the schools that enroll them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=435.0s)]
*  And he hates freedom of assembly and association, also in the First Amendment, that lets, for instance, law firms hire anyone they want to hire, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=439.0s)]
*  including people who prosecuted him. So he writes executive orders extorting those law firms into submission. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=447.0s)]
*  Again, think about where this is all going. The aspiration here is a vision of American life in which everything is controlled by a single man, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=453.0s)]
*  a single ruler. And it's not an exaggeration to say it's the literal nightmare of the founders. Right? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=464.0s)]
*  All of this is incomplete opposition to the most basic bedrock founding principles. Our birthright is Americans. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=474.0s)]
*  And the trick is now, and I think a lot of people watching this may be experiencing this, for the vast majority of Americans, right, in their day to day life, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=484.0s)]
*  it doesn't feel that unfree. It doesn't feel that different, really. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=492.0s)]
*  And what the Trump administration is banking on is they can take advantage of that sense of normalcy to take away all our liberties. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=496.0s)]
*  And that is why the fate of Kilmar or Briego Garcia matters to all of us. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=504.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV9r1wBO1Y0&t=526.0s)]
