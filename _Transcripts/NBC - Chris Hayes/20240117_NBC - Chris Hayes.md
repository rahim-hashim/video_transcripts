# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 17  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=0.0s)]
*  He said absolutely not. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=3.64s)]
*  The trial will go on just as it is. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=4.84s)]
*  The Trump con meets a brick wall in court. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=7.24s)]
*  Judge Kaplan for the second time today reminded former President Trump, you do not have the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=10.92s)]
*  right to be disruptive or to disregard court orders. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=16.0s)]
*  I hope that I do not have to remove you from the courtroom. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=19.84s)]
*  Tonight, the genuine threat of accountability for the Republican frontrunner. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Then. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=28.28s)]
*  Well, I am proud to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=29.28s)]
*  Why the indicted ex-president's Republican support is more complex than his foot soldiers [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  would have you think. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Plus, Congressman Dan Goldman on his new effort to censure Elise Stefanik. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=39.96s)]
*  I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=45.24s)]
*  And Senator Bernie Sanders on what's happening in Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=53.4s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=59.96s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=60.96s)]
*  Donald Trump was in court again today along with the writer, E. Jean Carroll, the woman [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=61.96s)]
*  who a civil jury concluded after a lengthy trial, lots of evidence, had been both sexually [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  assaulted and then subsequently defamed by Donald Trump. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=71.28s)]
*  They found that he sexually assaulted her and defamed her. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=75.98s)]
*  And she is now suing for additional damages after Donald Trump continued to defame her. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=79.4s)]
*  Today, Trump was there to do what he did in his civil trial for fraud. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=84.64s)]
*  To basically make himself the center of attention, to upend the proceedings, to further intimidate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=88.76s)]
*  the people trying to hold him to account. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=93.56s)]
*  In short, to subvert the orderly working of justice. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=96.36s)]
*  And today he was very close to being thrown out of that courtroom. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=100.72s)]
*  More on that in a second. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=104.88s)]
*  Before I get to that, it's worth recounting the actual details here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=106.6s)]
*  Because it's easy for them to get overshadowed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=111.0s)]
*  Starting two decades ago with an encounter in a Fifth Avenue department store and an [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  assault in a dressing room. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=118.6s)]
*  The minute I was in there, he shut the door and pushed me up against the wall and bang, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  bang my head on the wall and kissed me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=126.84s)]
*  It was so shocking. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=132.16s)]
*  So he pushed me, held me with his shoulder and I was wearing a coat dress and tights. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=133.98s)]
*  And he pulled down the tights. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=141.14s)]
*  And so that's what... [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=142.78s)]
*  He pulled them with both hands? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=146.42s)]
*  One. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=148.38s)]
*  And that was when it turned serious. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=151.38s)]
*  I realized that this was a fight. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=155.62s)]
*  It was against my will. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=160.98s)]
*  And it hurt. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=161.98s)]
*  And it was a fight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=162.98s)]
*  That is the definition of rape. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=165.92s)]
*  One definition. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=168.7s)]
*  That's the definition. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=170.82s)]
*  That is the definition of rape. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=172.82s)]
*  Now when E. Jean Carroll came forward, Trump attacked her again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=174.94s)]
*  He said she's a liar. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=178.76s)]
*  She just wants fame. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=180.26s)]
*  She's not my type. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=181.26s)]
*  And he cannot stop being vicious and defamatory. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=182.26s)]
*  Even after a jury sat and heard evidence that you did this, you monster, day in, day [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=186.54s)]
*  out he keeps doing it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  Why is he choosing to go to court? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=193.06s)]
*  Why is he voluntarily drawing attention to the details of this despicable act? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=195.66s)]
*  He just won the Iowa caucuses. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=200.94s)]
*  There are primaries ahead in New Hampshire and South Carolina. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  Why in the middle of a presidential campaign would he direct everyone's attention to a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=204.78s)]
*  case in which he has already been found liable for sexual assault? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=208.7s)]
*  And I think there's an answer. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=213.42s)]
*  It ties into the by now soul-deadening discourse taking place again on the roots of Trump's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=216.38s)]
*  political appeal, which we've all watched for eight years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  The core dynamic Trump has created is one where he is constantly playing the victim, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=226.82s)]
*  who's always persecuted, but, and this is key, is always getting away with it anyway. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  He's very open, very open in his campaign rallies about how his power comes from this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=237.58s)]
*  combination of victimhood and impunity. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=242.82s)]
*  I've been indicted more than Alphonse Capone. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=246.82s)]
*  You know who Alphonse Capone is? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=249.38s)]
*  Greatest gangster of all time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=251.98s)]
*  The greatest, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=253.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm like Capone, who got away with it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  Until he didn't. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=257.3s)]
*  But getting away with it, that's the fantasy he is selling to so many people, a fantasy [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=259.02s)]
*  that a lot of people really want to buy into. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=262.74s)]
*  Plenty of people daydream about what they might do in life without restraints, what [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=265.1s)]
*  do to their boss or their coworker or their sister-in-law. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=269.74s)]
*  They want to imagine a world in which they, like Trump, can transgress in any way they [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=274.18s)]
*  want to, in which they can say whatever they want to whoever they want and not face consequences, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=277.74s)]
*  in which they could lie, cheat, and steal, maybe even use force. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=282.58s)]
*  It's a sort of seductive mythos. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=285.82s)]
*  I think particularly to a certain kind of man, as the polling bears out, seductive mythos [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=288.18s)]
*  that he is selling and selling openly when he tells people, I am your retribution. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=293.2s)]
*  And he's been selling it since the beginning of his political career eight years ago. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=298.76s)]
*  They say I have the most loyal people. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=303.76s)]
*  Did you ever see that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=305.32s)]
*  Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=306.68s)]
*  any voters, okay? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=309.96s)]
*  It's like incredible. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=310.96s)]
*  People laugh there, but we learned back then in 2016 this wasn't just a public campaign [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=313.48s)]
*  schtick for Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=316.9s)]
*  It's how he views himself. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=318.24s)]
*  We learned it when he was caught on tape in private talking about how he treats women. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=320.5s)]
*  I've got to use some Tic Tacs just in case they start kissing her. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=325.26s)]
*  You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful women. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=329.3s)]
*  I just start kissing them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=332.06s)]
*  It's like a magnet. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=333.06s)]
*  I don't even wait. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=334.06s)]
*  And when you're a star, they let you do it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=335.06s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=338.58s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=339.58s)]
*  Grab them by the ... I can do anything. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=340.58s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=344.26s)]
*  That is the whole game, isn't it? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=345.74s)]
*  Incent doesn't matter. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=347.62s)]
*  What other people want to do doesn't matter. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=348.62s)]
*  The law doesn't matter. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=350.7s)]
*  It's a huge part of the appeal. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=352.18s)]
*  And so here he is in court again, a place where people are required normally to submit [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=356.38s)]
*  themselves before the power of the law. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  And if you've ever been on the wrong side of it, you know the power of the law in the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  United States is a serious thing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=367.94s)]
*  And how seriously did Trump take it today? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=370.58s)]
*  Well, his lawyers started out by asking for a delay in the trial so he could attend the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=372.42s)]
*  funeral of his mother-in-law, which the judge denied, saying Trump is under no requirement [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=376.1s)]
*  to attend the trial. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=380.18s)]
*  He just wants to be there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=381.26000000000005s)]
*  That brought the first of several courtroom shouting matches. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=383.22s)]
*  Former President Trump, as E.G. and Carol has been testifying, is making some side commentary [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=388.54s)]
*  that her attorneys say is within earshot of the jury. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=393.86s)]
*  Former President Trump had a bunch of very noticeable reactions. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=397.78000000000003s)]
*  He often shakes his head or mouths, that's not true. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=401.26000000000005s)]
*  That's when Judge Kaplan, for the second time today, reminded former President Trump that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=404.62s)]
*  he should not be making comments that the jury could hear or that even audience members [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=409.66s)]
*  could hear, and then said, you have a right to attend. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=413.9s)]
*  You do not have the right to be disruptive or to disregard court orders. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  I hope that I do not have to remove you from the courtroom. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=423.1s)]
*  And guess how Donald Trump responded to Judge Kaplan saying that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=428.06s)]
*  He said, quote, I would love it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=430.42s)]
*  I would love it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=431.9s)]
*  Because he wants to be the victim here, mumbling under his breath, clowering at the woman he's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=433.42s)]
*  already been found to have assaulted in a dressing room, and then defamed and continuing [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=437.54s)]
*  to defame, refusing to stop defaming her, even when it brings harassment and threats [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  down upon her, even when confronted by a judge who knows Trump is angling to be thrown out [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=448.54s)]
*  of a court proceeding, he does not even need to be attending because he wants to be a martyr. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=452.46000000000004s)]
*  This is the central focus of his campaign, as he made clear today, again, by posting [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=459.12s)]
*  to social media, trashing the judge during the hearing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=464.16s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=467.6s)]
*  The point is that what Trump believes personally about himself, and I think this is a genuine [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=471.36s)]
*  belief to the extent he has any self-awareness, and what he is selling people in the base [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=476.72s)]
*  particularly, but generally, is what he is also trying to achieve in the court and in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=481.48s)]
*  the country, which is immunity. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=487.64s)]
*  Complete immunity. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=491.64s)]
*  Total supremacy over everyone and everything, even the law. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=493.96s)]
*  And it is precisely what is so shocking about him as a person, how long through sheer shameless [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=499.8s)]
*  and sociopathic behavior, he has been able to get away with it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=504.0s)]
*  It is also the reason why it is so important to bend him to the will of the law of our [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=508.76s)]
*  nation, the law that we are all, as democratic citizens, collective participants in. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=515.5999999999999s)]
*  It's important at a moral level to hold him to account for his transgressions, like defaming [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=522.7199999999999s)]
*  the woman he sexually assaulted or trying to end the republic. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=527.0s)]
*  It is important at a democratic level to demonstrate the supremacy of the rule of law and to show [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  that no one is above it, but it is also supremely important politically. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=535.54s)]
*  The moments Trump has been politically weakest are the moments when he looks like a loser, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=543.5s)]
*  which is, in the end, what he truly, truly is. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=548.14s)]
*  Like after January 6th failed and he could not overturn the election, and he flew out [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=552.62s)]
*  of town, apparently with a bunch of classified documents. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=556.58s)]
*  And after the 2022 midterms, when all his candidates lost and Republican Party insiders [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=559.14s)]
*  again started grumbling about Trump being an albatross around their neck. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=563.66s)]
*  The con job he has been running his whole time in politics is that he is a winner. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=567.58s)]
*  The guy has never actually won a national majority of the votes, never. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=572.38s)]
*  And now he is working on the next phase of the con job, selling the notion that even [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=576.86s)]
*  the law itself cannot hold him and cannot restrain him, that he is sovereign over it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=581.58s)]
*  And so there's a million reasons the law has to hold Donald Trump to account. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=588.38s)]
*  But one of the biggest ones is to puncture the political myth of invulnerability and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=591.66s)]
*  impunity that he is selling to his faithful base. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=596.3s)]
*  Nancy Gertner is a former federal judge, now a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=600.94s)]
*  Harry Lippman served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=604.78s)]
*  as well as a U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=608.34s)]
*  They both joined me now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=611.58s)]
*  And Nancy, I'm so glad to have you tonight because you were a federal district judge. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=612.86s)]
*  And you know, federal district judges, fascinating job. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  You oversee all kinds of stuff. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=621.1s)]
*  You got civil trials, you got criminal trials, you might have complicated and sophisticated [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=622.7s)]
*  patent litigation. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=626.54s)]
*  I mean, it's a really interesting job. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  And you've got to kind of manage the courtroom no matter what it is. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=630.38s)]
*  Have you ever witnessed firsthand or heard of a scene described like the one today with [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=634.54s)]
*  Donald Trump in that courtroom? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=641.5s)]
*  No. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=645.82s)]
*  No. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=647.34s)]
*  He was baiting the judge. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=649.34s)]
*  And I mean, that's what he was doing. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=652.86s)]
*  It was like, hit me, hit me, judge, because he'd like... [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=654.3s)]
*  This is part of what you just said a moment ago, because he'd like nothing better than [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=656.62s)]
*  to claim that the entire proceeding is unfair because the judge excluded him from the courtroom. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=660.54s)]
*  And he's really just baiting the judge to do that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  And the judge appropriately is resisting until he can resist no more. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=669.58s)]
*  And that's what will happen the next time. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=674.62s)]
*  But that's what he's doing, just baiting the judge. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=676.38s)]
*  Could I... [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=678.46s)]
*  Let me follow up on that and then I'm going to go to you, Harry. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=678.96s)]
*  But just... [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=680.86s)]
*  We saw this with Judge Engorin, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=682.38s)]
*  And again, I don't... [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=684.78s)]
*  This seems like an impossible situation, right? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=687.0999999999999s)]
*  Because the guy, I think, genuinely is a sociopath. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=688.86s)]
*  He's genuinely shameless. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  He's got a whole weird set of incentive structures that almost no one who sits in that courtroom [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=692.2199999999999s)]
*  will ever have, right? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=696.38s)]
*  I mean, it's really sui generis. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=697.5799999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, there is some feeling where it's like, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=699.66s)]
*  no one else would get away with this. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm just watching these reports of the behavior. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=704.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think to myself, this is madness. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=707.66s)]
*  How... [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=709.98s)]
*  How are we allowing this? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=711.18s)]
*  We collectively allowing this to happen? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=712.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think there's no question. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=717.9000000000001s)]
*  If you change the race of the person doing this and change the charge, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine that any judge would give him, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=724.5400000000001s)]
*  the kind of runway that judges have been giving them. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  But nobody... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=730.86s)]
*  No judge wants the case to be about Donald Trump's misbehavior in the courtroom. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=731.74s)]
*  I mean, that's the problem. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=738.62s)]
*  If he's excluded, then that's what becomes the theme. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=739.82s)]
*  I also don't completely agree with you about... [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=743.1s)]
*  I mean, I think he wants to play the victim here. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=745.5s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=748.22s)]
*  I think he knows he can't control the outcome of the court. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=749.58s)]
*  He can't control this, or he can't control... [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=753.1s)]
*  And he can't control the civil fraud trial. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=755.2600000000001s)]
*  And what he's doing is essentially spinning it before the hammer falls. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=757.82s)]
*  And he's going to spin it by saying, you know, I'm victimized. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=762.5400000000001s)]
*  They excluded me. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=765.98s)]
*  The judge is unfair. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=766.86s)]
*  And that's what he's doing. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=768.38s)]
*  He knows he can't control it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=769.74s)]
*  And he certainly can't control a jury. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=771.5s)]
*  Yeah. It's like when he started saying the election was rigged in September of 2020. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=773.66s)]
*  It's like before anyone had done it, he'd already voted. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=778.86s)]
*  He's like, I don't know, man. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=781.26s)]
*  You might win. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=782.62s)]
*  But no, it's really just going to be rigged. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=783.5s)]
*  So there's a sort of seeding of the story beforehand. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=785.26s)]
*  I also think, Harry, there's this sort of important... [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=787.98s)]
*  The sort of centrality of immunity is a concept here and the through line of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=790.22s)]
*  the absolute immunity that his lawyers have asserted he is constitutionally entitled to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=794.3000000000001s)]
*  and the kind of immunity that he's embodying in his behavior, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=799.9000000000001s)]
*  both previously and now in these actual courtrooms. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=803.6600000000001s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=809.0200000000001s)]
*  I think it's really a brilliant point. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=810.7s)]
*  We've been focused on his desire for martyrdom, his desire to be a victim. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=812.7800000000001s)]
*  But I think it works at this fantasy level that he is someone who transgresses [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=817.0200000000001s)]
*  whenever he feels like it and gets away with it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=822.7s)]
*  And the stakes here are precisely the ones for him personally, for him politically, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=826.0600000000001s)]
*  for the country politically are those you laid out at the end of your presentation. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=830.86s)]
*  That is, does his appeal because after all, he has this sort of popularity. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=835.98s)]
*  At the same time, he's a vile personality and few like him, but it has everything to do, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=842.7800000000001s)]
*  I think, with being able to, in some 12-year-old fantasy way, to get away with it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=849.1s)]
*  So if in fact he is held to account, I mean, this is what the polls seem to suggest. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=853.74s)]
*  If his, I'm a winner, I'm a winner, I'm a winner fantasy is pierced. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=858.7s)]
*  Does that in fact domesticate him, bring him down to ground? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=863.02s)]
*  There are some heroes who are heroes notwithstanding losing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=866.5400000000001s)]
*  He is not one of them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=870.86s)]
*  I think it is the myth exactly that you put your finger on and the flip side of the martyrdom [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=872.5400000000001s)]
*  has to be the getting away with it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=878.14s)]
*  And that's the stakes that we are now all playing out. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=881.02s)]
*  Yeah. And Nancy, to your point, I mean, on the civil level, right, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=885.42s)]
*  he's already lost this trial, right? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=887.9s)]
*  I mean, he lost the first one. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=889.18s)]
*  This is just about damages in this one. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=892.06s)]
*  I don't think he's going to do that well on the civil fraud trial. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=893.9s)]
*  I mean, right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=896.38s)]
*  So at the civil level, that kind of accountability is almost is priced in at this point, right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=897.9s)]
*  Right. And I mean, it'll be very interesting to see whether he performs this way in the criminal trials, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=904.3s)]
*  where the stakes are much higher and where his liberty is at stake, right? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=912.14s)]
*  It's one thing to do this dance in the civil cases. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=915.98s)]
*  It's quite another thing if he does that before Judge Chutkin, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=920.22s)]
*  you know, it does that in the Georgia case. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=923.66s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=925.74s)]
*  And Harry, to your point there, I think that's also a very, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=926.62s)]
*  it's a very different environment to be, you know, you civil trial, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=929.26s)]
*  you could attend at your whether you want to or not criminal trial. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=933.1s)]
*  Your freedom is on the line before the state and you were sitting there as the indicted person. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=936.5400000000001s)]
*  And everybody knows it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=943.02s)]
*  So in other words, what happened in the civil trial, what will he do when he loses? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=945.1800000000001s)]
*  Just pronounce victory. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=949.9s)]
*  He does it again and again. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=951.1s)]
*  This was, you know, he makes it seem like not a problem. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=952.46s)]
*  Everyone understands when he's sitting in the defendant's chair, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=955.66s)]
*  if a jury pronounces guilt, he has lost big time, something everyone cares desperately about. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=958.86s)]
*  So that's in fact why the stakes seem so much higher there. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=965.58s)]
*  Nancy Gertner, Harry Lippman. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=969.42s)]
*  That was great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=970.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=973.02s)]
*  Coming up, nearly half of Republican voters in Iowa voted for someone other than Donald Trump [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=974.14s)]
*  this week. New reporting on what lies beneath the projection of inviolable strength. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=978.62s)]
*  Next. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=984.0600000000001s)]
*  First, I want to take a moment to congratulate President Donald Trump on his historic win in Iowa, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=984.56s)]
*  earning more votes than all the other candidates combined. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=993.28s)]
*  The people of Iowa spoke loudly and clearly, echoing the sentiment felt throughout the rest [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=996.56s)]
*  of the country. America is rallying in support of President Trump to save America and fire Joe Biden. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1000.8s)]
*  Today's ode to the dear leader was conducted by a Republican quickly distinguishing herself as [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1008.3199999999999s)]
*  perhaps the most craven and self-humiliating politician in all of American politics, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1012.4s)]
*  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. Of course, before her, the title was long held by that man, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1016.56s)]
*  Senator and podcaster Ted Cruz, seen here glumly calling voters for the Republican ticket in 2016 [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1020.72s)]
*  after pretending to be offended that Donald Trump called his wife ugly. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1026.48s)]
*  Yesterday, Cruz endorsed Trump again, this time just days after New York Times reported Trump [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1030.56s)]
*  recently said, quote, Ted, he shouldn't even exist. I could have destroyed him. I kind of did [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1035.52s)]
*  destroy him in 2016 if you think about it. But then I let him live. None of this is new or [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1040.32s)]
*  particularly surprising. This is about what we anticipated watching the Republican Party yet [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1045.6s)]
*  again fall in line as they always seem like they would. But I do think sometimes the story of Trump [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1050.32s)]
*  strength among the Republican Party actually overstates some of the complexity of what is [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  going on. Luckily, Michelle Goldberg just got back from Iowa where she was covering the cocks. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1060.72s)]
*  You were not. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  No, I got snowed out. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, she got snowed out. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1068.0s)]
*  Well, it's good that I know that you were supposed to go to Iowa. You didn't get a chance to go to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1070.6399999999999s)]
*  Iowa. You watched them like we all did. Right, right, right. There's a sense here's there's [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  two narratives that happen. There are two narratives that happen with Trump. One is [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1079.6s)]
*  this kind of like every Republican loves Trump. It's a cult of personality totally dominates the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  party. The other is the like any day now, the bottom is going to fall out and people are going [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1092.0s)]
*  to see the light. And we sort of oscillate between the two, even though I think neither [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1097.2s)]
*  actually captures what's going on. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1100.96s)]
*  Well, I think what's right and neither neither of those is quite true. I mean, what's true is [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1102.4s)]
*  that he there's certainly nobody in the Republican Party who can touch him. Because even if you have, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1106.88s)]
*  I mean, you don't even have an anti Trump majority in Iowa, right? He got kind of an outright [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1112.72s)]
*  majority, not just a plurality. But even in you know, there's other places where he's polling [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1117.52s)]
*  less than 50 percent, but still kind of ahead of his rivals. But but you can't necessarily add up [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1122.8s)]
*  the support of say, Nikki Haley to Rhonda Santis, because it's not as if one of them drops out that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1129.04s)]
*  that support goes to the other. I mean, Trump himself is some of their second choices. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1134.48s)]
*  And yet what I what I find sort of interesting is that like the the sort of Trump anthropology [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1140.0s)]
*  that we're being treated to again for like the 15th time, it's all about the base and the sort [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1145.92s)]
*  of hardcore folks. And there's just these tens of millions of people who like are like, yeah, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1151.28s)]
*  I don't really like the guy, but are going to vote for him. And like that to me is kind of remains [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1154.96s)]
*  the sort of most interesting part of the electorate, even though it's the one that I feel like we hear [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1159.44s)]
*  the least about. Like a lot of those are just they're partisan Republicans, right? It's like, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  I'll vote for literally anyone who's a Republican and this guy is it. But part of the two is that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1168.96s)]
*  like, if anything's going to change, it's in that group of people. Well, right. And because that's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1174.0s)]
*  a good group of people that necessary, you know, that a lot of them didn't vote for Donald Trump [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1178.96s)]
*  in 2020. And in some ways, that's the group of people that is the most befuddling. And maybe, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1183.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, it would be good to kind of understand them. Unfortunately, you kind of can't do a diner [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1189.68s)]
*  safari to find a group of extremely ambivalent people who might be persuaded to vote for Donald [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1194.08s)]
*  Trump. Those are also people, probably people. What we know about swing voters is that they're [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1202.08s)]
*  often the least plugged in part of the electorate, right? There's this fantasy that swing voters are [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1206.72s)]
*  incredibly deliberative, but in fact, they're just people who don't necessarily pay a lot of attention. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1211.1200000000001s)]
*  And so what's interesting to me is that- Yeah, it's like if you ask me who is the NHL MVP this year, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1216.32s)]
*  I would be a swing voter because like, I have no idea. I don't follow hockey. Like, I don't know, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1221.6000000000001s)]
*  right? Like, I would be a swing voter in that sense. People who follow hockey are like, oh, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1226.24s)]
*  it's definitely this guy. If you're checked out, you don't know. Yeah. And so I guess the question [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1229.44s)]
*  is, have they just kind of made their peace? Has Donald Trump so successfully changed the [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1234.32s)]
*  boundaries of political normality that it's no longer possible for people to be repulsed by his [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1239.6s)]
*  behavior, his threats, his legal jeopardy, all the rest of it? Or are people going to at some point [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1246.24s)]
*  start kind of tuning in again once Donald Trump is on their television every night, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1253.28s)]
*  assuming they're watching television once Donald Trump is in their face all the time, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1257.52s)]
*  and say, you know, do we really want to go through another four years of this? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1261.76s)]
*  And this is something you and I have talked about a lot, but this is where we come back to that kind [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1265.2s)]
*  of- there's the falling in line at the leadership level, which is not surprising, right? People say [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1268.72s)]
*  that's all driven by the base, and it's sort of driven by the base. But again, it's driven by this [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1276.16s)]
*  like 50 to 60 percent of the party, not 100 percent, which is where the sort of question of [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1279.52s)]
*  criminal accountability comes in, right? The polling, the entrance polling that said, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1287.28s)]
*  yeah, like a third of the people that went out in the snow in Iowa and said, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1290.72s)]
*  the guy's not fit for president if he's convicted. Other polling we have showing that a bunch of [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1294.48s)]
*  people are like, yeah, I'm not going to vote for him if he's convicted. The question is how much [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1298.16s)]
*  that holds, but it does send this flashing signal right now. Right, and I guess the question is, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1301.92s)]
*  how do they- if there is a conviction, how do people interpret that, right? Because I would [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1307.2s)]
*  imagine that there's probably some number of people who say that, but also- but of course, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1311.76s)]
*  Trump is never going to be convicted because he didn't do anything wrong. Right. You know, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1316.24s)]
*  there might be another group of people that thinks, well, his electability, you know, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1319.44s)]
*  my calculation about his ability to vote to beat Joe Biden really changes if he's literally [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1323.6000000000001s)]
*  convicted of a felony and facing prison. Literally a felon, literally awaiting his prison sentencing. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1329.6000000000001s)]
*  There's also something about this. I mean, it is very weird to watch this process just as a political [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1336.64s)]
*  reporter, and you and I have covered a number of cycles, because there is this strain- there is [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1340.64s)]
*  largely a lack of narrative tension that there usually is in these undertakings. I mean, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1346.0s)]
*  covering the 2000 primaries were not that interesting, but 2004, the Democratic primary [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1350.4s)]
*  was actually quite active. There was a whole up and down before Kerry secured it. 2008 was one of [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1355.84s)]
*  the most fascinating elections of our time. The 2012 Republican primary had all these different [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1360.4s)]
*  people who shot to the front before. 2016, of course. There is something about this where, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1365.76s)]
*  this sort of quasi-incumbent, slow encroaching of the Death Star is just in a category by itself. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1371.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no. It's just this incredibly grim slog to an inevitable anti-climax, right? Even though [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1378.24s)]
*  what's hard to kind of get your mind around is both the total lack of drama despite the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1386.64s)]
*  unbelievably high stakes. That's exactly the combination. And that's what makes it feel like [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1393.04s)]
*  I'm just kind of sleepwalking off a cliff. That's exactly right. Michelle Goldberg, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1398.32s)]
*  who always has a way with words. Thank you very much. Still ahead, the ongoing outrage [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1401.6799999999998s)]
*  after the House Republican chair referred to the January 6 rioters in prison as hostages. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1406.3999999999999s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman today moved to censure Elise Stefanik, and he's here to explain why. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1412.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce a resolution to censure [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1423.36s)]
*  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik for providing aid, comfort, and support to the rioters and [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1427.2s)]
*  insurrectionists who violently attacked this Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an effort to [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1432.64s)]
*  undermine our democracy and illegally stop the peaceful transfer of power. A few hours ago, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1439.04s)]
*  New York Democratic Congressman Daniel Goldman introduced a resolution to censure his fellow [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1444.96s)]
*  New Yorker, the fourth most powerful Republican in the House, Elise Stefanik, for comments like [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1450.48s)]
*  this one. Do you think that the people who storm the Capitol should be held responsible [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1454.96s)]
*  to the full extent of the bomb? I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1461.1200000000001s)]
*  I have concerns. We have a role in Congress of oversight over our treatments of prisoners. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1466.64s)]
*  Hostages. She called them hostages, like the Israelis taken by Hamas, hostages. Congressman [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1472.48s)]
*  Goldman says that Stefanik's support for convicted criminals who've been charged with offenses [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1478.72s)]
*  against the United States government is, quote, unacceptable for a member of Congress. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1482.64s)]
*  And Congressman Goldman joins me now. Congressman, was the hostages comment that tipped you over? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  It was sort of the breaking point, I think. Her rhetoric and support for the January 6 [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  insurrectionists and for generally the conspiracy theories peddled by the criminal defendant Donald [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1499.6000000000001s)]
*  Trump have been ratcheting up. And it's one thing for a rank-and-file member to be saying those [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1506.64s)]
*  things. It's altogether something different for the number four person in the leadership of the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1512.32s)]
*  House to be attacking our democracy, giving support to those who attacked this Capitol where I stand [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1517.12s)]
*  right now. And instead of doing the work of the House and passing a budget and providing aid to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1526.08s)]
*  our allies around the world and addressing the issues such as the border and inflation and other [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1534.56s)]
*  things that the American people care about. But this is 2024, Chris. It's an election year, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1540.48s)]
*  and we just cannot have members of Congress who are lining up, gearing up to subvert our democracy [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1545.3600000000001s)]
*  once again. And it just felt like we need to lay a marker down right now. I don't care what Donald [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1553.84s)]
*  Trump says, but sitting members of Congress have a separate oath to this body and to our Constitution. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1559.68s)]
*  There's also an interesting context here reporting today from our own NBC and CNBC that [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1567.76s)]
*  there's discussions of at least Stefanik as a possible running mate to Donald Trump. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1573.52s)]
*  The thought of Stefanik as a possible choice for Vice President, Trump nodded approvingly. She's a [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1578.0s)]
*  killer, he said according to the person at the event. I suspect he doesn't mean that literally. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1581.76s)]
*  And then further, if you're Trump, you want someone who's loyal above all else, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1586.96s)]
*  a Republican campaign operative said, and this is important, particularly because he sees Mike [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1590.4s)]
*  Pence as having made a fatal sin. Of course, Mike Pence's fatal sin was preserving the Republic [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1595.2s)]
*  in the face of the most concerted effort to destroy it since the Civil War. Does it worry [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1602.0s)]
*  you that the way that your colleague Elise Stefanik appears to be auditioning for a role [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  as Vice President is to basically give aid and comfort to the very people who tried to overturn [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1614.8s)]
*  the Constitutional Republic? Well, not only that, Chris, she has refused to say that she will [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1620.48s)]
*  certify the election as Mike Pence did. And that is clear. And it's been clear since 2019 [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1625.92s)]
*  when Elise Stefanik flipped a switch to go from a relatively low key, low level, rational Republican [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1634.8s)]
*  from upstate New York to Trump's biggest defender in the impeachment hearings and then beyond. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1644.24s)]
*  And it is clear that she is channeling Donald Trump in every way that she can, trying to audition [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1650.8s)]
*  to become the Vice President. And given that she has no morals and no integrity because she [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1656.56s)]
*  completely flip-flopped in all of her policies and politics for sure, you can't trust her to do [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1663.36s)]
*  the right thing. And that's exactly what Donald Trump wants. He wants a sycophant. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1670.96s)]
*  He wants a yes person who will do whatever he says. And it is clear that Elise Stefanik in the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1675.52s)]
*  run up to the 2024 election is trying to play that game. I want to ask you about something else you [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1681.52s)]
*  were calling some attention to today, which is the sort of House legislating around the border. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1687.8400000000001s)]
*  And I thought this is interesting and hasn't quite gotten enough attention. Basically, we know [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1693.8400000000001s)]
*  how obsessed Republicans are with the border. We know that Mike Johnson went down there to the [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1698.64s)]
*  border for a photo op. And what has also been happening behind closed doors are bipartisan [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1702.8000000000002s)]
*  negotiations happening around some legislation that would have a whole bunch of different [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1708.8000000000002s)]
*  features in it regarding the processing of asylum seekers, possible money at the border. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1713.6000000000001s)]
*  Mike Johnson on a call the other day basically said he told his caucus, we're not doing any [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1720.64s)]
*  legislating essentially because they want to have the issue to run against Biden. So they don't. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1725.52s)]
*  And he basically came very close to essentially saying that basically telling the caucus, like, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1731.92s)]
*  we're not doing a deal here because a deal takes it off the table. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1737.04s)]
*  Absolutely. And other members have actually said that quiet part out loud, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1740.56s)]
*  but we've seen this all year, Chris, they've been blasting the Biden administration, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  secretary, my orcas, who they're trying to impeach right now in the Homeland Security Committee, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1749.84s)]
*  on which I sit for not doing anything at the border. But what is not known is that the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1753.92s)]
*  administration and secretary my orcas have actually implemented a lot of policy changes to address [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1760.48s)]
*  the issues at the border. And you know what the Republicans have done? They have filed lawsuits [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1767.04s)]
*  to stop the administration from trying to solve the problem. So while secretary, my orcas in the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1771.68s)]
*  White House are negotiating with a bipartisan group of senators to actually solve the problems [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1777.68s)]
*  at the border, House Republicans are over here trying to impeach secretary, my orcas for not [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1783.28s)]
*  trying to solve the problems at the border. And they are making it very, very clear that they [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1789.52s)]
*  will accept nothing but the most draconian extremist policies because they view it as a political [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1795.6s)]
*  cudgel and they would rather have it as an election issue than actually solve the problems that we are [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1803.44s)]
*  facing. And there is no question that is what is going on. All right, Congressman Dan Goldman, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1809.92s)]
*  thank you for your time tonight. Appreciate it. Thank you. Still to come with Election Day on the [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1815.28s)]
*  horizon, the Biden economy continues to surge. The latest numbers showing Americans are feeling [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1819.2s)]
*  better about their situation than they might tell pollsters. Next. Over the past year, we've seen an [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1824.4s)]
*  enduring and stubborn gap between the way Americans feel about the economy and what the data say. By [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1834.8s)]
*  nearly every single metric, the economy is showing incredible progress. Inflation, the biggest [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1840.8799999999999s)]
*  challenge, has fallen significantly. The consumer price index is down from a high of more than 9% [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1845.9199999999998s)]
*  year over year change to just 3.4%. Gas prices, crucially, are also way down, harboring at a [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1851.28s)]
*  national average of just over $3 a gallon. That, of course, makes a huge difference for most [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1857.52s)]
*  Americans' wallets. Take a look at the 30-year mortgage rate. Over the past year, that is a [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1862.08s)]
*  significant drop, coming down from nearly 8% late last year to about 6.7%. In 2023, the unemployment [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1867.1999999999998s)]
*  rate hit a 50-year low, falling to just 3.4%. It has held quite steady since then. Wages, crucially, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1874.96s)]
*  have been growing steadily. As the light blue line on the graph shows, the average Americans are [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1882.56s)]
*  seeing more money in their paycheck adjusted for inflation. As you can see here, wages have begun [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1887.36s)]
*  to catch up with inflation, represented by that dark blue line. After the drop resulting from the [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1893.36s)]
*  pandemic in 2020, gross domestic product has been rising, growing all throughout last year. Of [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1898.7199999999998s)]
*  course, most Americans are not tracking all of these metrics, but you would think the good news [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  would come through when we ask people how they feel about the economy in general. Not so. One [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1909.28s)]
*  recent poll, which is representative, 59% said they would rate the condition of the national [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1914.88s)]
*  economy as bad. 53% of Americans said they are expecting the economy to slow or even enter a [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1919.44s)]
*  recession in 2024, which is very much at odds with the forecasts of professional forecasters. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, there is another way to ask those kinds of questions that may do a better job of demonstrating [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1931.68s)]
*  how people actually feel. Instead of framing them in the context of the national economy at large, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1935.8400000000001s)]
*  take a look at what happens when you ask about people's personal financial well-being. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1941.28s)]
*  Axios recently posed a bunch of these questions as part of what they call the VIBE survey. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1946.48s)]
*  When they ask Americans to rate their personal current financial situation, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1950.72s)]
*  a significant majority, 63%, described it as good. They also got a lot of really positive reaction [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1954.8s)]
*  to questions about employment. 63% described their own job security as a sure thing. More than half [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1961.6s)]
*  Americans said that they would be okay if they lost their job tomorrow. They could find an [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1968.0s)]
*  equivalent or better job quickly. The majority also agreed that, quote, my employers need me more [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1972.0s)]
*  than I need them. So what does all that add up to? Well, as economist Paul Krugman explains, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1977.12s)]
*  we know that, quote, partisan orientation affects expressed views about the economy. Democrats are [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1983.2s)]
*  more positive when a Democrat holds the White House. Republicans are more positive when the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1987.84s)]
*  president is Republican. But the current disconnect demonstrates the partisan effect is much stronger [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1991.68s)]
*  on one side, quote, two and a half times as large for Republicans as it is for Democrats. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=1997.52s)]
*  A big chunk of people who are extremely negative about this economy are extremely negative about [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2002.8799999999999s)]
*  it because they are committed partisans who don't like the Democratic president. And in this election [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2006.8s)]
*  year, the big question is, if the positive economic trends continue, will the reality of the situation [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2011.84s)]
*  overcome the propaganda? Mr. President, let us be clear. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2018.56s)]
*  The reason as to why this resolution must be passed today is that right now, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2025.36s)]
*  right now, as we speak, hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza, innocent children, are starving [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2034.8799999999999s)]
*  up right before our eyes. We cannot turn away. We must act. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2044.32s)]
*  We have passed the 100-day mark of the Hamas deadly attack on Israel on October 7th, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2054.56s)]
*  which killed over 1,200 Israelis, and over 120 Israeli hostages taken on that day still remain [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2059.12s)]
*  to this day in Hamas custody. It has also passed the 100-day mark of Israel's subsequent bombardment [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2064.88s)]
*  of Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks. And in that time, more than 24,000 Palestinians in Gaza [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2070.88s)]
*  have been killed, nearly half of them children. The situation has been dire for a while, but it [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2076.88s)]
*  just gets worse and worse. I mean, from everything we can gather, from reporters there in international [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2083.04s)]
*  aid organizations, UN human rights experts warning a quarter of the population, a quarter, are starving, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2088.1600000000003s)]
*  that famine is imminent. You might have seen videos of people essentially rioting when food [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2093.92s)]
*  trucks come in, so desperate to feed themselves. Yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders took to the [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2098.8s)]
*  floor of the Senate, urging his colleagues to pass a resolution asking for accountability that will [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2104.2400000000002s)]
*  require the Biden administration to report on possible, quote, violations of internationally [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2109.2000000000003s)]
*  recognized human rights by the government of Israel and to certify the, quote, no unit of [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2114.1600000000003s)]
*  the Israeli security forces receiving US assistance has committed any gross violations of human rights. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2119.1200000000003s)]
*  Only 11 senators of the 100 supported moving the resolution to even be considered for a vote. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  The vast majority voted to just table it without even bringing it to a vote. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2132.1600000000003s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. He chairs the Health, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2136.0800000000004s)]
*  Education, and Labor Committee. It's good to have you, Senator. First, just some context here. My [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2139.76s)]
*  understanding is that it is already the case under US law, and this is due to things that happened [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2143.76s)]
*  during the Cold War, which found the US was supplying arms to various governments that were [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2147.92s)]
*  using those arms then for human rights abuses, that it's already a part of US law that the State [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2153.44s)]
*  Department has to certify when they give weapons to anyone, doesn't matter who it is, that those [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2158.64s)]
*  weapons are not being used to violate international humanitarian law. That's right. Chris, this is a [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2162.8s)]
*  long-standing law that says something that's very sensible. If the taxpayers of this country are [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2168.2400000000002s)]
*  providing military equipment to any nation on earth, we have to make sure that that country is [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2173.68s)]
*  using it consistent with international law and human rights. This is long-standing. That's correct. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2179.44s)]
*  And so explain to me what the vote was on yesterday in that context. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2185.92s)]
*  What the vote was on yesterday was to have the State Department do a study on whether or not [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2192.4s)]
*  Israel was violating international law and human rights. And given the fact that many of the weapons [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2202.08s)]
*  that Israel has used in the last hundred days come from the United States of America, we certainly [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2213.8399999999997s)]
*  have a right to know that. My view from day one, Chris, has been that Israel has the right to respond [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2219.92s)]
*  to Hamas's barbaric attack on October 7th, but they do not have the right to go to war against [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2229.92s)]
*  the entire Palestinian people, which is what we are seeing right now. And as you've just mentioned, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2235.84s)]
*  the humanitarian situation in Gaza now is unbelievably bad, and we're looking at the [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2242.2400000000002s)]
*  possibility of hundreds of thousands of children starving. We cannot allow that to happen. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2248.32s)]
*  You know, we've had reporting throughout here, and I think it's quite established, that the [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2253.6000000000004s)]
*  Biden administration, through Secretary Blinken, through Jake Sullivan, even in person-to-person [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2257.28s)]
*  calls between the president and Benjamin Netanyahu, have been urging a timeline, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2263.92s)]
*  a vision for a post-conflict form of reconstruction to ratchet down the intensity and scale of [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2269.44s)]
*  bombardment. As of yet, that doesn't seem like it's happening. I just wonder, like, as a U.S. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2276.32s)]
*  senator, does anyone have any sense of a timeline here? Is this when this might, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2282.0s)]
*  when this phase of this war might end? I think there is a huge frustration when we see [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2287.92s)]
*  President Biden appropriately saying that he is concerned about indiscriminate bombing [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2294.72s)]
*  and the humanitarian disaster, urging Netanyahu and his right-wing government to do the right thing. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2302.16s)]
*  And Netanyahu basically says, hey, you know, screw you. We will do exactly what we want to do and [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2308.7999999999997s)]
*  when we want to do it. So the bombing right now, you know, what we are looking at, I want people [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2314.8799999999997s)]
*  to appreciate this, 70 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2319.6s)]
*  You got 1.9 million people who have been displaced from their homes. They need food, they need water, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2328.08s)]
*  they need medical supplies. As I mentioned a moment ago, children are now on the verge [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2333.8399999999997s)]
*  of starvation. This is not what the people of America want when they provide billions of dollars [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2338.56s)]
*  to Israel. And it's high time that we told Netanyahu that he's not getting another nickel [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2346.32s)]
*  unless he radically changes his attitude towards the Palestinian people and the nature of his [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2352.7999999999997s)]
*  military campaign. Two of your colleagues, I think, if I'm not mistaken, I believe it was [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2360.24s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen and Senator Merkley both went to Ra'afah. That, of course, is the border town [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2366.88s)]
*  between Gaza and Egypt proper. And Jeff Merkley wrote this. I just want to read it to you and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2373.7599999999998s)]
*  get your reaction because there's a bunch of issues in getting that humanitarian aid in. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2378.48s)]
*  Senator Merkley writing that trucks filled with food, water, and medical supplies are lined up [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2382.7999999999997s)]
*  waiting to be granted entry into Gaza. Even if all the items on our truck have been pre-approved [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2386.4s)]
*  by Israel to ensure they are not, quote, dual-use items that have a potential military purpose, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2390.64s)]
*  Israeli authorities can and do still reject some items as an inspection site. And then this is [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2395.12s)]
*  interesting. And if a single item is rejected, the entire truckload is rejected. How concerned [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2399.6s)]
*  are people, you and your colleagues, about the specter of mass starvation, which is what the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2405.92s)]
*  World Food Program is warning about? To me, it's unbelievable. I mean, how do you say concerned? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2410.4s)]
*  I would hope that we're more than concerned. We are sitting here supplying the Netanyahu [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2418.08s)]
*  government with the arms they need and in the process of starving hundreds of thousands of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2424.8s)]
*  children. Concern is too a modesty word. We have got to act and we've got to act now. What Merkley [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2428.88s)]
*  was talking about is not only is the bombing making it impossible for trucks, you know, if you're a [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  truck driver trying to deliver your goods, you're not going to do it when you're getting bombed. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2444.0800000000004s)]
*  But in addition to that, what Israel has done at the border has made it extremely difficult [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2448.64s)]
*  for these trucks to get through. And bottom line here is we cannot turn our backs on the enormous, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2456.8799999999997s)]
*  the enormity of the suffering that is now taking place in Gaza. We have got to act. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2464.4s)]
*  You are a Jewish American. You have family that was killed by Hitler. You've talked about that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2470.08s)]
*  You're the closest, I think, any American Jewish candidate has ever come to the presidency or at [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2476.72s)]
*  least a nomination. And you were in Israel in a kibbutz in your youth. This has been just a [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2482.7999999999997s)]
*  wrenching time, I think, for international and American Jews. What do you feel and think as a [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2488.7999999999997s)]
*  Jew watching all this play out in these last hundred days? Well, you know, Chris, what I would [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2495.7599999999998s)]
*  hope that no matter what my religious background is, I would respond accordingly. You know, if this [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2501.6s)]
*  was taking place in Italy or in Ireland, I would feel the same way. But I have to tell you, having [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2508.96s)]
*  spent months in Israel as a kid, knowing the history of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2516.16s)]
*  for me to see a right-wing Israeli government create this kind of misery in Gaza is extraordinarily [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2524.16s)]
*  upsetting. No question about that. Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time today. I appreciate [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE24eDDlPz8&t=2533.92s)]
