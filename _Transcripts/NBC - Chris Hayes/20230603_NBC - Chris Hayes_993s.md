# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 2
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. President Joe Biden just wrapped up a prime time address to the nation from the Oval Office touting the debt ceiling deal that he brokered with Speaker and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=0.0s)]
*  Covina McCarthy this week. A lot of attention has been focused on the swift passage of that bill in the House on Wednesday, the Senate late last night, large bipartisan majorities. While that's been [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=9.14s)]
*  happening, Special Counsel Jack Smith has been barreling ahead with his investigation of the ex-president, now the leading contender for the Republican nomination 2024. Earlier this week, we learned that Smith had obtained a key new piece of evidence in the case of Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. He is now in possession of an audio recording in which Trump acknowledges he held onto a classified Pentagon document about a potential attack on Iran. On that recording from a July [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=20.18s)]
*  2021 meeting at his Benminster, New Jersey golf club, Trump began railing about his handpicked chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, who was described in media accounts at the time as having guarded against Trump's striking Iran in the final days of his presidency. New York Times reports the ex-president then began referencing a document that he had with him, saying that it had been compiled by General Milley and was related to attacking Iran. According to new reporting just out this afternoon, Trump's attorney general, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=50.12s)]
*  the attorneys have not found that classified document in question, even after receiving a subpoena specifically for it earlier this year. So where is it now? We don't know. But I think this new information that we got yesterday about this recording and the context of the document and Mark Milley finally clarifies a key question, the question around Donald Trump's motive for holding onto these many classified documents after he left the White House. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=80.12s)]
*  In a strictly legal sense, the motive doesn't actually matter. In order to file criminal charges, the special counsel just has to believe that a crime is committed and the evidence is strong enough to lead to a conviction that will hold up upon appeal. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=109.0s)]
*  But of course, juries, us in the public, do want to know why. Why would he do this? And the question of why the ex-president took these documents and then refused to give them back and apparently obstructed attempts to get them back so far has not been clear. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=121.6s)]
*  I mean, there's been a few theories. So some people have suggested, floated this, not based on any evidence, just as a theory, right, that Trump had a corrupt financial incentive, that he wanted to sell the information he'd taken to foreign interests. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  And I have to say that always struck me as pretty unlikely. I mean, I think that would be a more complicated, high-risk play than Donald Trump is equipped to even attempt. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=152.68s)]
*  Then there's another theory, the suggestion that he kept the documents because the guy's just a pack rat who really likes souvenirs. And I have to say that's been kind of my leading belief. It seems totally plausible. I mean, just given the state of his office in Trump Tower. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  This office. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=179.44000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=181.08s)]
*  Is all you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's a little bit junky. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? This I just got a few weeks ago. This is from the Marine Corps. That's the chair for the apprentice that I used. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=195.28s)]
*  These are different things. Tom Brady's Super Bowl helmet. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=199.84s)]
*  This is Mike Tyson's belt. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=200.68s)]
*  This is Vince McMahon from the World Wrestling Federation. This is Shaquille O'Neal's shoe. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=204.24s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=209.84s)]
*  Right here, which is a serious shoe. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=210.56s)]
*  Is that a real shoe? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=211.88s)]
*  That's a real shoe. He took it off after a game and handed it to me. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=212.56s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  I carried it like this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  OK, so I don't I don't think that's a bit right. That's not a bit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  This is a guy who really, really likes knickknacks and memorabilia. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=221.8s)]
*  And he likes to show them off to people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, do you remember that he even stuck an empty classified folder that he'd clearly taken from this time of presidency in a display case at the bar at Trump Tower. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=228.96s)]
*  So keeping the dozens of classified documents that went in those folders could just be his presidential version of Mike Tyson memorabilia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=241.28s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=252.68s)]
*  But again, I mean, this might be the reason. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=254.84s)]
*  But we can take a step back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=257.8s)]
*  It is a lot of time and effort and legal risk and legal bills for what amount to a bunch of souvenirs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=260.2s)]
*  Which brings us to why the new reporting about the Pentagon document Trump talked about on tape is to me so revealing, almost kind of a light bulb moment in understanding this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=268.0s)]
*  As the New York Times mentioned in their reporting in the summer of 2021, there were several news stories about how General Mark Milley was working to prevent Donald Trump from attacking Iran in the last month of his presidency. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=277.92s)]
*  This one from the New Yorker explained that his chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley had been engaged in an alarmed effort to ensure that Trump did not embark on a military conflict with Iran as part of his Quixotics campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 election and remain in power. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  The chairman secretly feared that Trump would insist on launching a strike in Iranian interests that could set off a full blown war. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=306.32s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump absolutely hated that story. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  He brought it up in that recorded meeting, railing against General Milley, and he claimed the document that he had, right, the classified document he'd taken, again, according to reporting on the recording. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=316.64s)]
*  That document, he says Milley wrote, that that would undermine the general story. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  How could Donald Trump have been working against, how could Milley have been working against attacking Iran when he wrote the plan of how to do it? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=334.4s)]
*  Now, again, to be clear, this is all, I think, misleading and bluster. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=341.84s)]
*  The military has contingency plans for pretty much everything, including probably a war with Iran. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=345.96s)]
*  Sources have also told multiple news outlets that Milley did not actually write that report. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=351.12s)]
*  But in Donald Trump's point of view, that document was his ammunition to settle his score with the general. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=356.64s)]
*  And that is the motive that really makes sense to me. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=365.84s)]
*  Not that he just plucked documents randomly as souvenirs, though maybe he did that, but that he took them specifically as receipts. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  If he has the documents in his possession, he can wield the information they contain as leverage. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=378.52s)]
*  The information in those classified documents is powerful. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  That is why the entire complicated, overly complicated system of classification exists. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=389.4s)]
*  It is why the world of intelligence agencies exists to extract information against the will of other states, because that information is useful and it is powerful. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=395.08s)]
*  Donald Trump would want that secret information for the same reason a spy might want it, to use it to his advantage against his enemies. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  That motive fits perfectly within Donald Trump's character. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=417.96s)]
*  I don't know if it's the motive, but it's the first time a possible motive makes the whole situation snap into focus for me. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=422.56s)]
*  And the recording about this one document may be the final piece of the puzzle falling into place in special counsel Jack Smith's investigation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  It has been one week since Ron DeSantis made it official, taking on Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  And he's made it clear that he thinks the way to beat Trump is to always run to Trump's right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=448.79999999999995s)]
*  To be the true conservative against the pretender Donald Trump. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  It's why he thinks he has a comparative advantage if he runs against the one thing the last administration unequivocally did right, the COVID vaccine and Operation Warp Speed. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=457.84s)]
*  The way they weaponized these COVID vaccines was a massive incursion into our freedoms. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=468.84s)]
*  They wanted to deny people the right to put food on their table if they didn't bend the knee and get a COVID shot that they may not have wanted and that many of them did not need. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=476.08s)]
*  We can never allow Warp Speed to Trump-informed consent in this country ever again. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  DeSantis can't bring himself to say the name Trump except sort of smuggle it in there at the end of that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=495.32s)]
*  He thinks that position is a winner. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  He's been touting his anti-vax record in almost every some speech. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=503.48s)]
*  But while it might be tactically enticing way to distinguish himself from Trump, I personally think it's strategically disastrous from a political point of view. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=506.8s)]
*  His competition thinks so, too. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  One Trump super PAC just released an attack ad pointing out that DeSantis was all for vaccines before he was against them. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=516.84s)]
*  We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you this important public service announcement. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=524.12s)]
*  So my view is, is if you get a vaccine, the vaccines are effective. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=530.24s)]
*  You're immune. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=534.92s)]
*  If you are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, the chance of you getting seriously ill or dying from COVID is effectively zero. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  The vaccines protect you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=545.12s)]
*  Get vaccinated. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=546.84s)]
*  So that's Team Trump attacking DeSantis for being pro Trump vaccine. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=548.52s)]
*  Because Juan DeSantis clearly thinks now that running as the unfettered anti-vaccine candidate is the way to go. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=553.16s)]
*  But again, it seems like a truly disastrous position to hold in the general election. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=559.28s)]
*  Margie O'Meara is a Democratic strategist and pollster. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=563.52s)]
*  Tim Miller is a former RNC spokesman, now a writer at large for the bulwark. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=566.32s)]
*  And both join me now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=569.84s)]
*  I should note, Tim, you wrote about this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  I should know that it isn't just, I mean, you could do the vaccine mandates as a sort of soft version of this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  But the other day, someone was yelling at Trump with like anti-vax heckling at an event. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=579.28s)]
*  And the DeSantis people tweeted it about how he didn't talk about how all the people, the vaccines hurt, right? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=583.72s)]
*  Like much more than like the mandates, like the actual vaccine. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=589.76s)]
*  You wrote this as expected, DeSantis hits Trump from the anti-vax, right? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=593.6s)]
*  The two best things Trump did, Operation Warp Speed and First Step Act are the first attacks out of the gate. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  At what point does this become too much for remaining normie RS to swallow? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=602.48s)]
*  Do you think he sticks with this? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=606.04s)]
*  I do. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=608.84s)]
*  I think DeSantis has made the calculation that the answer to my last question there is that normie RS will stick with him no matter what, because he's a better bet for them than Donald Trump. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=609.36s)]
*  And they're so desperate to get rid of to get rid of Donald. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=618.48s)]
*  And so I think DeSantis has decided that he has no risk, at least in the primary, it's the primary discussion. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=621.36s)]
*  Maggie can talk about the general, no risk in the primary on that center right flank. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=626.44s)]
*  Eventually people will line up behind him. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=630.2800000000001s)]
*  He's not worried about the Tim Scott's of the world. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=632.2800000000001s)]
*  And that he can find issues where he can outflank Trump on the MAGA right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=634.6400000000001s)]
*  And this is one of them. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  And I just think that this to that tweet, they said that DeSantis warned him said yesterday, I thought this was so telling. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=640.6400000000001s)]
*  Trump in that same speech where he got heckled about side effects of the Vax called the the person that killed Ashley Babbitt a thug. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  And, and, you know, the DeSantis campaign does not defend the Capitol police that defends the Capitol. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=654.7600000000001s)]
*  And they could have said nothing about the Trump speech. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=660.08s)]
*  They could have attacked him over that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  But instead, they chose to attack him for defending the vaccine. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=663.48s)]
*  I just think that's very telling about what they think their strategic play is. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=667.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=670.24s)]
*  And I again, I think the primary is distinct. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=670.56s)]
*  I won't pretend to know Margie. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=672.68s)]
*  I'm curious what you think of this in the general. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=674.56s)]
*  Like if you're going to spend six to 10 months running as the anti-vax candidate again, not just vaccine mandates, which I think you're is there sort of more cross pressure views on, but like the anti-vax candidate, which I think he's flirting with and sometimes endorsing. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=676.5999999999999s)]
*  Like, how do you what does the polling say? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=689.88s)]
*  What do you think about that as a general election issue? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=692.04s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, right? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=696.12s)]
*  Because for a long time, you had a lot of Republican leaders wanting to tell people to forget about COVID, ignore COVID, forget about it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=697.68s)]
*  But now they're encouraging their voters to really think about this in a way that's played odds with where they were a little while ago. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=704.32s)]
*  And if this worked as a strategy in the general election, you would have seen Republicans more successful in 2022 around the country. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=711.6s)]
*  There were lots of governors races, Senate races, congressional races, local races where you have Republicans trying to go back to the times and harken back to the times of school closures and use that as something. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=719.0s)]
*  And that's different from the vaccine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=730.32s)]
*  But Jason and it didn't work because people are now looking forward. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=731.48s)]
*  And now, as time has moved on to go back again, I think it's going to be hard. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=735.48s)]
*  Now, polling we did for Navigator shows most Republicans say that they have received the vaccine. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=740.32s)]
*  About two thirds of say they received the vaccine. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=745.72s)]
*  It's about 14 percent of the country that are Republicans who have not received the vaccine. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=748.2s)]
*  So it's not really enough to have a general election strategy. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean that all those voters are going to vote based on that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=758.76s)]
*  Doesn't mean there aren't voters who have had the vaccine and might vote based on that. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=761.32s)]
*  But it's a sign that this is not a unifying message. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=765.72s)]
*  The first point you make there, I want to go back to you, Tim. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=770.96s)]
*  I think it's such a smart one because there's the specifics of the vaccine messaging, which I think is actually just like substantively incredibly dangerous and that we've unnecessarily lost hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans because of. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=772.88s)]
*  And I will never forgive the people that played a part in that, to be totally honest. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=783.76s)]
*  But there's also just this political question of like being obsessed looking back. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=789.28s)]
*  And I think there's something, Marjorie, you're putting a finger on Tim. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=793.32s)]
*  People on the right, particularly the most like, you know, part of the base, are very obsessed with 2020. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=796.88s)]
*  They're obsessed with like the George Floyd protests. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=803.52s)]
*  They're obsessed with the Trump election. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=806.12s)]
*  They're obsessed with like the media and Hunter Biden and why they didn't put that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=809.2800000000001s)]
*  They're obsessed with the covid policies. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=813.64s)]
*  It is like this fuel, this this of rage. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=815.44s)]
*  And I think it's driving a lot of Republican based politics in a way that the rest of the country is like really trying not to think about that anymore. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=820.48s)]
*  Yeah, and it makes you seem kind of weird and obsessive, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=830.4s)]
*  To be continuing to talk about this. But I do think it's true that it's bottom up. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=833.24s)]
*  I want to say that Charlie, Charlie Kirk group, I went to their conference back in December, exactly those issues that you just talked about. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=837.24s)]
*  Covid, George Floyd woke 2020 election fraud. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=844.72s)]
*  Like, that's what was animating the attendees that I talked to. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=848.24s)]
*  Right. And so that's why the politicians are talking about this. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=850.76s)]
*  Just one other thing to my point with the risk to Santa's place here, I think, is a big part of his argument with the soft mega voters. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=853.24s)]
*  Right. Is that he's more electable than Trump. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=863.08s)]
*  And so I think the more he flirts with this kind of stuff, there's this unforeseen risk of him going far out to the right and seeming weird, you know, seeming out of touch and having those voters like look at Trump, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=865.28s)]
*  kind of like they looked at Trump and Cruz and thought that Trump was the more mainstream one. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=875.4s)]
*  And I think this is a risk that the Santa's plays by the general election and primary politics interplay with each other. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=879.32s)]
*  And there's one more thing, Margie, and I think this has to do with sort of the complexities of politics, which is that people think about Trump as sort of beating everyone in that primary from the right. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=885.16s)]
*  But he didn't. He was he was sort of to the left and a bunch of things. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=893.44s)]
*  The Iraq war, which he said he opposed, although he hadn't on entitlements and social insurance, Social Security, Medicare. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  He's supported universal health care. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  He is attacking the Santas from the left on Social Security and Medicare on a national sales tax, which was a big sort of like right wing plan. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. We're going to get rid of the income tax. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=914.96s)]
*  It strikes me that that's actually pretty effective stuff, even in a Republican primary. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=916.48s)]
*  I'm curious what you think the polling shows. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=920.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it goes to show that politics is not always about just voting for a list of policy positions, especially when it comes to Trump. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=923.0s)]
*  People are voting for it's not just Trump. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=932.76s)]
*  This is true. A lot of elections. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=934.96s)]
*  Who do they feel is fighting for them? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=936.2s)]
*  Who cares about them? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=938.2s)]
*  Who would, you know, go out and fight for you? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=939.2s)]
*  Who wants to meet you? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=943.2s)]
*  Wants to talk to you, understands you, gets you. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=944.28s)]
*  And a lot of Republicans feel that way about Trump is less about the litany of a variety of policy positions. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=946.92s)]
*  And that has made some of this very complicated, both for Democrats and Republicans. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  Republicans are saying, hey, conservatism means this. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=958.4s)]
*  It doesn't mean spending on all these programs. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=961.32s)]
*  And for Democrats who say, you know, well, Republicans are all over the place and you're inconsistent. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=963.88s)]
*  Margie O'Mara and Tim Miller, thank you both. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=969.6s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kkuM16AMtk&t=971.96s)]
