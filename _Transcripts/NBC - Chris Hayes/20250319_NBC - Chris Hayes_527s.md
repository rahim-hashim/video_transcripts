# Idaho teacher fights back after order to remove ‘Everyone is Welcome Here’ poster
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc)
*  Look, in the face of everything that's happening, it takes guts for ordinary people to stand up against it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=0.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. So, so, so many people are. Like Sarah Enama. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=5.44s)]
*  For the past four years, she's taught world civilization to sixth graders at Lewis and Clark Middle School in Meridian, Idaho. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=10.84s)]
*  And like all teachers, she decorates her classroom with motivational posters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=17.32s)]
*  Posters like this one that says, in this room, everyone is welcome, important, accepted, respected, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=22.68s)]
*  encouraged, valued, and equal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=28.72s)]
*  And even more straightforward one showing children's raised hands with the tagline, everyone is welcome here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  You've probably seen this kind of stuff a million times in kids classrooms. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=38.04s)]
*  I know I have as a dad. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  The kind of inspirational messages that are simply meant to tell students, whoever you are, you are in the right place. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=44.36s)]
*  You belong here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=50.12s)]
*  Shouldn't be controversial, right? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=51.84s)]
*  So for four years, these signs have survived sans harassment. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=54.32s)]
*  Nobody said a word about them. That is till about a month ago. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=57.96s)]
*  My building administration came to me during my lunch period and told me that they needed to be taken down by the end of the day. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=63.16s)]
*  They told me that they were in violation of district policy because in today's political environment, they're considered a personal opinion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=70.12s)]
*  Did they say somebody complained about them? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=79.64s)]
*  No, I asked if anyone had complained about them and they said, no, we just want to protect you from that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=81.63999999999999s)]
*  If that were to happen in this political environment, that is not acceptable. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=88.32s)]
*  Yeah, I was told a couple of things that everyone is welcome here is not something that everybody believes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  So that's what makes it a personal opinion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=101.16s)]
*  You were told this that not everybody believes everyone is welcome. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=103.6s)]
*  Right. Not everyone believes everyone is welcome. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=106.88s)]
*  Believe it or not, that is the new policy of the West Ada School District. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=111.96s)]
*  It is a policy they updated after Idaho lawmakers passed a state law stating that critical race theory divides people and is contrary to the unity of the nation and the well-being of the state. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  The team trying to cancel this classroom poster is in a kids classroom is led by the school district's chief academic officer, Marcus Myers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  And yes, he says the problem here is the colors of the hands. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=136.28s)]
*  If there was a poster that just said everyone is welcome here, black background, white words, would that do you think the team would have objected to that? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=141.72s)]
*  I don't think the team would have. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=150.12s)]
*  Now that had been a team decision, but I don't think the team would have. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  And I say that because those exist in our schools. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=154.28s)]
*  I was going to say, do you have things that are almost identical to this? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=158.16s)]
*  They just don't have multicoloring and then they don't have the hands that obviously are different shades of skin tone. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. Ranging from white all the way to black. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=168.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=170.48s)]
*  So the text by itself doesn't allow for interpretation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  OK, so that school district chief academic officer, Marcus Myers, everyone is welcome here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  As long as you're not talking about, you know, everyone. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=179.56s)]
*  As dumb as this is, and boy, it's dumb. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=184.32s)]
*  This is what is happening across the country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Civil rights initiatives, anti-discrimination initiatives, diversity initiatives, inclusion, all being gutted. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=190.04s)]
*  So if you were in that teacher's position, what would you do? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=196.48s)]
*  Because I was told to take it down by the end of the day, I did so. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=201.72s)]
*  And the following few days, I just was so unsettled by it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  And so I went back into my classroom and put it back up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=209.84s)]
*  And I emailed my principal and said, I just I don't agree. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=215.28s)]
*  I don't agree that this is a personal opinion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=220.28s)]
*  I feel like this is the basis of public education. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=222.6s)]
*  Sarah Anama says the school district offered to buy her other less controversial posters. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=227.08s)]
*  She says Myers, the district boss, told her the political environment ebbs and flows and what might be controversial now [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  might not have been controversial three, six, nine months ago. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  And we have to follow that. They have now given her until the end of the school year to take down the posters [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=240.56s)]
*  or face possible punishment for insubordination. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  That, she says, just solidified her resolve. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=249.44s)]
*  I just feel like as a teacher and I feel like probably a lot of teachers share this sentiment, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=253.28s)]
*  I would do anything to protect my students. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=261.4s)]
*  I love all of them unconditionally. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=264.16s)]
*  We protect them from danger, quite literally would take a bullet for these students. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=266.36s)]
*  And this is the one small thing that I feel like I can do to speak out against this and stand up for them, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=271.04s)]
*  to protect them from being affected by racist sentiments affecting their classroom. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=279.64s)]
*  Find it hard to grapple with the fact that the reason why this poster needs to come down [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=284.88s)]
*  is because there are people outside of our school that disagree with it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=292.52s)]
*  Now, Sarah Anama was not alone. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=298.04s)]
*  Her students have staged walkouts on her behalf and are supporting her decision to keep the posters up [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=299.96s)]
*  by sharing bracelets and T-shirts with that message. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=305.64s)]
*  Everyone is welcome here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=308.08s)]
*  It is amazing to watch this history teacher at a grade school in Idaho [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=310.24s)]
*  stand up to the creeping fascism of her state and her school and school district, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=313.08s)]
*  while so many of the elected leaders in our country, Democrats and Republicans, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=317.2s)]
*  seem entirely complacent in the face of it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=320.12s)]
*  But everywhere you look, ordinary citizens are out there on their own in demonstrations [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=322.76s)]
*  and council meetings, expressing their fear and their anger and their hope for this country [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=327.28s)]
*  and wondering where their leaders are. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=331.72s)]
*  Just look at what's happening at Republican town halls. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=334.28s)]
*  Elon Musk gets $40 billion a year in funding from the federal government. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=337.44s)]
*  What makes you think that has no conflict of interest? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=341.88s)]
*  That he has no conflict of interest? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=345.28s)]
*  Do you think he would cut that before he would cut our Medicare or our Social Security or our jobs? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=348.68s)]
*  I support Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=357.6s)]
*  I believe that the president is very supportive of Ukraine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=366.68s)]
*  Like him or not, Elon Musk has brought a lot of really smart people to go. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=373.68s)]
*  So, you know, I don't, it's not good, it's not healthy for the republic to have court orders [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=380.68s)]
*  that are not being obeyed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=388.68s)]
*  It's also... [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=390.68s)]
*  It's also not healthy for the republic when you have district judges that probably don't have the authority [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=391.92s)]
*  issuing national-wide injunctions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=399.92s)]
*  So, what's... [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=401.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=408.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=409.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=410.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=411.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=412.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=413.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=414.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=415.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=416.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=417.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=418.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=419.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=421.16s)]
*  How can you be against a ballast budget? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=424.16s)]
*  Alright. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=429.16s)]
*  Alright. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=434.16s)]
*  Here's a... [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=447.16s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=448.16s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=449.16s)]
*  So, your proposal to solve this is to tax the rich. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  All of that is just the latest in weeks worth of everyday Americans speaking truth, demanding [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  more from their politicians in this moment. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  And not just from politicians at every level. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=468.16s)]
*  They are wondering, as I am, why university presidents and heads of NGOs and titans of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  And so many people who have status and a platform and so much they owe this country aren't doing [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  more and saying more about the danger that is enveloping us. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=482.48s)]
*  I think we need people across every sector of society to show the courage, not just of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=487.36s)]
*  these protesters, but the bravery of Sarah Enama, an Idaho school teacher who's risking [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=493.12s)]
*  so much to stand for what's right. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRtjma7lc&t=504.72s)]
