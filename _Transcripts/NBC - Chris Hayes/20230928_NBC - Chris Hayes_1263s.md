# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 27
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there's going to be another Republican primary debate featuring a bunch of candidates not named Donald Trump [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=2.0s)]
*  polling in a distant second and lower. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=7.0s)]
*  And what will likely be laid bare on that, Steve, even without Trump present, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=10.0s)]
*  is the extent to which what used to be bogged standard Republican issues [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=14.0s)]
*  have been cast aside to serve the whims of the ex-president who isn't there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=18.0s)]
*  As someone who's covered politics professionally for several decades, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=23.0s)]
*  particularly as someone who lived through 9-11 and the run of the Iraq War, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=26.0s)]
*  I've got to say the Republican Party's war on the Pentagon and U.S. armed forces is pretty shocking, pretty head spinning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=30.0s)]
*  It starts with Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=38.0s)]
*  a former football coach who has spent months blocking Congress from filling hundreds of vacancies in the Pentagon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=42.0s)]
*  It's part of a long shot attempt to get the U.S. military to make it harder for service members to get access to an abortion. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=49.0s)]
*  Now, Congress can circumvent Tuberville's blockade, which is procedural and mired in Senate procedure, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=55.0s)]
*  but to go around the blockade is a time-consuming process. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=61.0s)]
*  So last Wednesday, the Senate did take the time to confirm Air Force General Charles Q. Brown Jr. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=65.0s)]
*  as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the nation's top military officer. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=72.0s)]
*  Now, General Brown was very well regarded. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=78.0s)]
*  He was confirmed on a broadly bipartisan basis, 83 to 11. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=81.0s)]
*  All 11 no votes came from Republicans, one of whom was Tommy Tuberville. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=87.0s)]
*  And when pressed on his no vote, Tuberville had this to say about General Brown. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=93.0s)]
*  I heard some things that he talked about, about race and things that he wanted to mix into the military. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=98.0s)]
*  Let me tell you something. Our military is not an equal opportunity employer. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=104.0s)]
*  We're looking for the best of best to do whatever. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=108.0s)]
*  We're not looking for different groups, social justice groups. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=111.0s)]
*  We don't want to single-handedly destroy our military from within. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=116.0s)]
*  He talked about race and things he wanted to mix into the military, mixing in the military, race. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=120.0s)]
*  We're looking the best of the best. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=127.0s)]
*  We're not looking, we don't want to single-handedly destroy our military from within. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=129.0s)]
*  Now, for many reasons, I think that's a gross and racist thing to say about a man who will be the second black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=134.0s)]
*  It's also just on its face factually untrue. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=142.0s)]
*  The Department of Defense literally is an equal opportunity employer. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=145.0s)]
*  In fact, the DOD has an office of equal employment opportunity under the Inspector General [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=149.0s)]
*  and an office of diversity, equity, and inclusion focusing on, quote, equal opportunity policies. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=154.0s)]
*  Today, one day after that interview, the MAGA Republican House voted to cut the salary of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who is also black, to $1. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=160.0s)]
*  This initiative was pushed by none other than Marjorie Taylor Greene, who accused Lloyd of jeopardizing national security, presumably by being too woke. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=171.0s)]
*  And if Greene wants to play this rhetorical game, wouldn't the party blocking top military appointments be the one jeopardizing national security? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=180.0s)]
*  There's a lot to say about this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=188.0s)]
*  I will just note, again, as some of you have covered politics for two decades, particularly the wake of 9-11, run-up to Iraq War, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=190.0s)]
*  that it goes without saying, if a Democrat tried something like this, Republicans would be calling for them to be tried for treason. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=196.0s)]
*  And that's not hyperbole, which I'll get to in a second. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=203.0s)]
*  Now, not to be outdone, Lauren Boebert, who has a kind of feud, I guess, with Marjorie Taylor Greene, they're in a kind of competition, she pulled the stunt of her own today. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=206.0s)]
*  What she did was propose the house cut the salary of another Pentagon official, Sean Skelly, explicitly because Skelly is trans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=214.0s)]
*  I rise today to offer my amendment that utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary of Sean Kelly, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=223.0s)]
*  That salary shall be reduced to $1. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=233.0s)]
*  This delusional man thinking he is a woman embodies and espouses the woke-ism that's causing significant harm to our military readiness and troop morale. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=236.0s)]
*  Setting aside how gross it is to purposefully misgender someone in that way, Boebert's objection here is the identity of the person, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=251.0s)]
*  Imagine if Boebert tried this stunt with any other identity. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=261.0s)]
*  She said we need to effectively stop paying a government employee or bust them down to a dollar a year because they're Greek or they're Latino or they're Jewish or they're black. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=264.0s)]
*  It's just an outright bit of rank bigotry directed at a service member from the well of the house, live on camera. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=275.0s)]
*  And what I've just given you a taste of is in the last 48 hours. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=282.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans are still careening us towards a government shutdown, which, by the way, is going to meet the troops will not get paid. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=288.0s)]
*  Now that vote I mentioned a moment ago elevating General Brown to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is because the current chairman, as you may have seen, General Mark Milley, is leaving his post when his term expires next month. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=295.0s)]
*  Milley, of course, was first appointed by then President Trump, who has since soured on him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=308.0s)]
*  And over the weekend, Trump effectively said that Milley should be executed for treason. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=314.0s)]
*  That's not I'm not making that up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=320.0s)]
*  That's not an exaggeration. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=322.0s)]
*  That's what he suggested. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=323.0s)]
*  Over some spurious allegations, Milley spoke to Chinese leaders about Trump's mental fitness. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=324.0s)]
*  Now, what Milley actually did was reach out to his Chinese counterpart under the direction of the secretary of defense, which is civilian, to make sure that Donald Trump's desperate coup attempts and erratic lashing out didn't lead to a war with nuclear armed China. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=329.0s)]
*  And thank God he did that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=342.0s)]
*  In a new interview out today, Chairman Milley addressed those threats from the president. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=344.0s)]
*  President Trump recently said that your dealings with China were so egregious that in times gone by, the punishment would have been death. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=349.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=359.0s)]
*  He said that as much as these comments directed at me, it's also directed at the institution of the military. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=364.0s)]
*  And there's 2.1 million of us in uniform. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=369.0s)]
*  And the American people can take it to the bank that all of us, every single one of us, from private to general, we're loyal to that Constitution and we'll never turn our back on it no matter what. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=373.0s)]
*  No matter what the threats, no matter what the humiliation, no matter what. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=382.0s)]
*  If we're willing to die for that document, if we're willing to deploy to combat, if we're willing to lose an arm, a leg, an eye to protect and support and defend that document and protect the American people, then we're willing to live for it too. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=385.0s)]
*  So I'm not going to comment directly on those things, but I can tell you that this military, this soldier, me, will never turn our back on that Constitution. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=398.0s)]
*  Now Milley has become a villain in MAGA world for rider reasons. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=407.0s)]
*  One of them is that they see him as insufficiently bigoted against LGBTQ members of the armed forces. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=411.0s)]
*  That's a subtext that Republican Congressman Paul Gosar made explicit when he wrote in his weekly newsletter, quote, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=417.0s)]
*  I bet you you hadn't heard that until now, most of you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=423.0s)]
*  Yes, he meant hanged. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=426.0s)]
*  The context of that statement where Gosar called for the execution of the highest ranking military officer in the country, comparing him to a Nazi collaborator, a Quisling, was about, of course, January 6th. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=427.0s)]
*  And here I think we kind of unlock the mystery. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=440.0s)]
*  Like what on earth is going on? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=443.0s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=445.0s)]
*  Why are Republicans waging war against the military, the top brass? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=447.0s)]
*  January 6th, more than anything else, that is the original sin of the military's top brass for MAGA Republicans. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=453.0s)]
*  And I believe all the bigotry is sincere, definitely part of the right wing meltdown. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=460.0s)]
*  The origin of this sustained assault, particularly on the top brass, this garbage about the military being too woke, is mostly a smokescreen to hide their sustain for the fact that in their view, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=465.0s)]
*  the upper echelons of the US Armed Forces were insufficiently loyal to Trump's coup. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=476.0s)]
*  I mean, that's really what it comes down to, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=482.0s)]
*  Leaders of the armed forces of these United States, the ones who take an oath to protect the country, the ones who take an oath to protect the country, the ones who take an oath to protect the country, the ones who take an oath to protect the country, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=485.0s)]
*  and they refuse to be the armed tip of the spear for Trump's attempt to end that constitutional republic. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=495.0s)]
*  That is their own [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=501.0s)]
*  That is their sin. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=521.6s)]
*  That is their crime. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=525.6s)]
*  That is why they are now the enemy of this MAGA faction. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=526.6s)]
*  Ergo, the military is woke. Ergo, the military is the deep state. Ergo, Republicans are waging war on the military. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=530.6s)]
*  And all of their leaders who are not entirely the tank for Trump's war on democracy, those who can't be trusted to be loyal, they must be purged. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=538.6s)]
*  And to be clear, this is not just speculation. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=546.6s)]
*  It's what Trump is saying out loud, promising that he is going to do. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=548.6s)]
*  Here's my plan to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our democracy from Washington corruption once and for all. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=555.6s)]
*  And corruption it is. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=563.6s)]
*  First, I will immediately reissue my 2020 executive order restoring the president's authority to remove rogue bureaucrats. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=565.6s)]
*  And I will wield that power very aggressively. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=574.6s)]
*  Second, we will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=577.6s)]
*  And there are plenty of them. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=584.6s)]
*  He is saying I will purge the security forces of the United States of those who are not loyal to me and my authoritarian aspirations. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=586.6s)]
*  He's saying it plain as day. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=595.6s)]
*  He's promising it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=597.6s)]
*  The question in front of American voters is, do you want to give Trump the chance to purge the military so he can finish the job he started on January 6th? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=599.6s)]
*  We have breaking news tonight in Donald Trump's criminal case in Washington, D.C. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=609.6s)]
*  This is the coup trial where Trump is charged with four felonies connected to his efforts to steal the 2020 election stay in power. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=614.6s)]
*  The judge in that case, Judge Tanya Chutkin, just filed an order responding to Trump's motion asking she recuse herself in the case. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=621.6s)]
*  Trump actually began demanding Chutkin's refusal within days of his indictment on August 1st, announcing he had very powerful grounds for his request. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=630.6s)]
*  Earlier this month when he filed his motion, the grounds didn't look quite so powerful. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=640.6s)]
*  His lawyers based the motion on things Judge Chutkin said at hearings for two defendants facing sentencing for crimes at the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=644.6s)]
*  His lawyers arguing that Judge Chutkin had, quote, suggested President Trump should be prosecuted and imprisoned. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=653.6s)]
*  Well, in her 20 page response today, Judge Chutkin basically said they were making things up, writing, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=660.6s)]
*  At the outset, it bears noting the court has never taken the position the defense ascribes to it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=666.6s)]
*  That former President Trump should be prosecuted and imprisoned. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=671.6s)]
*  And the defense does not cite any instance of the court ever uttering those words or anything similar. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=675.6s)]
*  She goes on. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=681.6s)]
*  It is the defense, not the court, who has assumed the defendant belongs in that undefined group of people who should face charges. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=682.6s)]
*  And to extrapolate an announcement of the defendant's guilt from the court's silence is to adopt a hypersensitive, cynical, and suspicious perspective rather than a reasonable one. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=689.6s)]
*  Defendant's motion for recusal is denied. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=699.6s)]
*  Shan was a former federal prosecutor who served as counsel to Attorney General Janet Rideau, and he joins me now. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=702.6s)]
*  Shan, maybe we can start before we get into this of just what the standard for recusal is. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=708.6s)]
*  I imagine it's got to be relatively high, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=714.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, the system works in these sort of random assignments of judges, and generally you kind of get the judge you get. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=717.6s)]
*  So what is the bar here? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=724.6s)]
*  It's a pretty high bar, Chris. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=726.6s)]
*  It's the clear and convincing standard, which is actually the next highest to the highest one, which is beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=728.6s)]
*  So it's a very challenging standard. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=737.6s)]
*  And as you say, it's challenging for good reason, because if you made it very easy, then you would really encourage judge shopping. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=738.6s)]
*  And that's what the court system does not want to do. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=745.6s)]
*  Now, the reasoning here was the argument by Trump's lawyers is they basically zeroed it on things she said at sentencing in two other January 6 trials. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=748.6s)]
*  My understanding is there's actually pretty bedrock Supreme Court precedent on this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=757.6s)]
*  And there's a bunch of other cases that they cite in their brief that are judges saying things in public appearances, the press. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=761.6s)]
*  And Judge Shetkin seems to be focused on saying, look, those are not germane, right? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=770.6s)]
*  We're talking about what I said at sentence. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=774.6s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=776.6s)]
*  And the precedent really talks about how judges who are speaking within the courtroom, that speech is particularly scrutinized with a high bar as opposed to making public pronouncements, which might be deemed to be prejudicial. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=778.6s)]
*  And also the precedent zeros in on whether the court is speaking about this particular defendant seeking recusal. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=794.6s)]
*  And she did not address it to Trump's guilt or whether he should be charged. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=801.6s)]
*  She was addressing arguments made by those defendants trying to lessen their guilt, saying they were influenced by others. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=807.6s)]
*  So the idea that as the court sets out in her order, that simply suggesting that the court may have been suggesting that that really is very, very far from meeting this kind of standard. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=815.6s)]
*  Yeah, we should just I mean, just to give the context here, right. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=825.6s)]
*  She's at sentencing for a defendant named Christine Priolo, who's found guilty for her role in January 6. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=827.6s)]
*  She went inside the Capitol. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=833.6s)]
*  Her lawyer lawyers after leniency, arguing that Trump and his inner circle of convince the election been stolen. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=835.6s)]
*  And she writes in her opinion, the court did state the former president was free at the time of Priolo's sentence, an undisputed fact upon which Priolo had relied for her mitigation argument. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=840.6s)]
*  But it went no further. It being the court there, I didn't say anything else. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=850.6s)]
*  The defense purports to detect an inescapable message in what the court did not say that President Trump is free but should not be. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=854.6s)]
*  What's interesting here to me is you've got the judge before you. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=860.6s)]
*  You file a motion that contorts her own statements like she knows the context of what she said. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=865.6s)]
*  It's a wild thing to do to try to wrench out of context statements by the very person to whom you were filing the order, especially because that's always the person who is the initial finder of fact and law. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=873.6s)]
*  There is the very person you're trying to recuse. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=887.6s)]
*  It's interesting because most lawyers may talk about you don't want to seek to recuse the judge. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=890.6s)]
*  You may irritate them some. That is true. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=895.6s)]
*  But I think the bigger risk for these Trump attorneys is by following Trump's lead and making this very weak, attenuated recusal argument. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=898.6s)]
*  What really hurts them isn't that Judge Chutkin is going to get mad at them. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=907.6s)]
*  She's a very fair jurist. I used to practice with her when she was a public defender. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=912.6s)]
*  No. The problem is they're going to lose their credibility. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=915.6s)]
*  She's going to feel you're willing to make any old argument and that really hurts the attorney in court. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=919.6s)]
*  Yeah. Reputational capital. It's a thing you draw on, right, over the course of a long trial. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=924.6s)]
*  And of course, we expect they'll appeal. We'll see what happens. It doesn't look very good in terms of the grounds of that. We'll see what happens. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=931.6s)]
*  Sham Wu, thank you very much. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=936.6s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=937.6s)]
*  General Barry McCaffrey is a retired four-star U.S. Army general. He's a recipient of three Purple Hearts. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=939.6s)]
*  Paul Reichoff is a former U.S. Army infantry officer, host of the Independent Americans podcast, and they both join me now. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=945.6s)]
*  General, let me just start with you and your reaction to just what we've seen in the last really four or five days. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=952.6s)]
*  You've got the Tuberville blockade. You've got the vote against the Joint Chiefs of Staff because he wants to mix. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=959.6s)]
*  He talks about race and he wants to mix it in the military. You've got two people, Donald Trump, Paul Gosar, calling for the execution of Milley. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=965.6s)]
*  You've got votes today, successful in the House. This isn't just one person saying it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=973.6s)]
*  Two votes today, one vote that would successfully take the salary of Austin down to a dollar. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=977.6s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=983.6s)]
*  Well, first of all, I strongly endorse your opening comments. I think that was very sound, very objective. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=986.6s)]
*  This is worth being extremely concerned about. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=991.6s)]
*  During the follow on to Trump's lost election, he actually made moves, which I said at the time, to run a coup against the government of the United States. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=995.6s)]
*  There's no question in my mind he put a retired lieutenant colonel in and set death, sent a gang of people over there with him. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1005.6s)]
*  Mark Milley and the senior officers of the armed forces did swear an oath to the Constitution and they wouldn't go along with it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1013.6s)]
*  But I think what we are seeing is a parallel to the 1930s in Nazi Germany. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1022.6s)]
*  I don't say that's a Republican Party that's 15 to 25 House members, a couple of senators and all those who are Trump mega loyalists. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1029.6s)]
*  This is a cult. It's a lawless cult. And it's a major threat to the armed forces of the United States and our security. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1040.6s)]
*  It's shameful to talk about General Mark Milley. By the way, he's not going to be intimidated. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1047.6s)]
*  You know, he's a prince and hostage player. He's a tough guy. He has years in combat. His mom and dad fought in World War II. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1053.6s)]
*  But it's a shameful act on the part of those who are speaking in a manner to support authoritarian government. This is outrageous. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1061.6s)]
*  You know, one thing that's striking when you see Milley is, you know, I think if I sat down with like the top brass of the U.S. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1072.6s)]
*  military and we just like talk politics, like there'd be a lot I think that we don't see eye to eye on. People have different views. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1077.6s)]
*  I'm coming from a different place. But I think one of the things that Milley expresses and I think the thing you really see is [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1083.6s)]
*  Milley reiterating that there is a bedrock, ironclad consensus, loyalty and fidelity to the U.S. Constitution. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1089.6s)]
*  And ultimately, that is incommensurable with loyalty to Trump. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1097.6s)]
*  He's drawing a line. Yeah. Right. Saying I stand on this side and you stand on that side. And Milley retires on October 1st. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1102.6s)]
*  And I hope he lets the fist fly. We need to hear from everything he knows. And I think it's his patriotic duty. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1108.6s)]
*  I think it's critical to our national security because what this is all about is about what I've called the American insurgency. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1114.6s)]
*  It is a political and social movement focused on violently overthrowing our government. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1120.6s)]
*  And it has lead elements, including Trump, including folks like like the former national security adviser, Mike Flynn. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1124.6s)]
*  And the lead soldier in this in Congress is Tommy Tuberville, who is ridiculous, radical, reckless and racist. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1130.6s)]
*  And I've called him Senator Redneck because that's what he is. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1136.6s)]
*  You want someone to lead this ridiculous racist thing that undermines our national security. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1139.6s)]
*  Tuberville is like me. I'll be your guy. And he is now doing that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1144.6s)]
*  He's got 10 minions who followed him to vote against C.Q. Brown. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1147.6s)]
*  And every day it's something new that undermines our national security. It hurts our troops. It hurts our morale. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1150.6s)]
*  Our enemies are celebrating. Vladimir Putin loves this. But there's also the political side of this. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1155.6s)]
*  This is driving the GOP further and further away from America and especially from independents like me. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1159.6s)]
*  I've called this the Confederate wing of the GOP. They don't want to preserve the military of 2023. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1164.6s)]
*  They want to create the Confederate army. They want to take us back to the eighteen hundreds. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1168.6s)]
*  They don't understand this modern world and they're fighting it. And we've got to fight back. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1173.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, to follow on that. And I'll come back to you in a second, General. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1177.6s)]
*  Just the idea that, you know, you and I are around the same age. Right. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1180.6s)]
*  And obviously you served during that part of that period, that intensely fraught period. Right. Post 9-11. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1185.6s)]
*  The idea that the military is woke, like the idea that like and what they mean by woke is faithful to a creedal vision of the nation as bound together across difference in support of the Constitution. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1191.6s)]
*  That to them is woke. But what they also mean is diverse. And what they also mean is not like that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1204.6s)]
*  I'm glad you're naming it because there are serious racial components to every element of this. Right. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1209.6s)]
*  They continue to oppose some of the historically important heroic leaders of our military who are also black. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1214.6s)]
*  Time and time again, Tommy Tuberville is opposite significant black leaders. And he says, I'll be the guy. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1220.6s)]
*  I'll be the one to take that politically unpopular position because he wants to be this savior. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1226.6s)]
*  He wants to be this person who will go up to Trump and say, I'm your guy because it's a coordinated attack to undermine our national security and push their political agenda and anyone that stands in their way, even if it's the Pentagon. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1230.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Puc7m4rz0&t=1244.6s)]
