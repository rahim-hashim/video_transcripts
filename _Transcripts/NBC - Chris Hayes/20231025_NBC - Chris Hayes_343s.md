# Raskin Don't be fooled by ‘good manners' of MAGA speaker Mike Johnson
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo)
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=0.0s)]
*  He served on the January 6 committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=2.56s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=3.92s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=6.44s)]
*  Congressman, new speaker Mike Johnson, your thoughts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=8.24s)]
*  Well, you cannot get to the right of Mike Johnson in the mega caucus. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=12.32s)]
*  It's just inconceivable that you could get to the right of him. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=19.48s)]
*  There are people who are definitely more lunatic than he is, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=23.44s)]
*  and he's got very good manners, and he's an able lawyer. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=28.72s)]
*  But when we say he opposed democracy, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=32.72s)]
*  we know that from his giving a legal gloss and finish [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  to all of Donald Trump's arguments about electoral fraud [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=41.0s)]
*  and making the independent state legislature doctrine argument, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=44.24s)]
*  which the Supreme Court fortunately did not bite on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=48.64s)]
*  But if he's not for democracy, what's he for? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=53.08s)]
*  He's for theocracy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=55.28s)]
*  He wants a nationwide ban on abortion [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=57.12s)]
*  with no exceptions for rape or incest. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=60.32s)]
*  He voted against affirming women's right [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=64.88s)]
*  to travel across state lines for the purposes of obtaining health care. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  He's also voted against reaffirming women's contraceptive rights. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=73.28s)]
*  He is a real enemy of Social Security. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=78.88s)]
*  From my perspective, he wanted to increase [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=82.24s)]
*  the age of Social Security retirement to 70 years old. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=85.0s)]
*  He's very much in the Steve Bannon mode of trying to dismantle [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=90.28s)]
*  the regulatory state, by which they mean democracy itself. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=94.92s)]
*  And so he's a decent guy and he's a nice guy, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=99.16s)]
*  but nobody should be fooled by it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=104.56s)]
*  Donald Trump cemented his hold over the Republican Party today, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=106.52s)]
*  and he is in control of the House of Representatives right now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=111.16s)]
*  Yeah, also, I'm just going to go out and make a prediction. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=114.28s)]
*  I usually don't do this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=116.8s)]
*  Trump's going to be mad at him at some point. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  He's going to turn on him at some point. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  He's going to betray Trump at some point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=121.96s)]
*  Like, we've watched this a million times, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=123.56s)]
*  This is, I mean, Kevin McCarthy, you know, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=126.64s)]
*  went down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=128.72s)]
*  He took all the wrong-colored starbursts out of his, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=130.72s)]
*  you know, out of his bowl to present to Donald Trump. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=135.72s)]
*  And what good did that do him? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  The guy got cut loose. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=139.72s)]
*  So, like, I don't know how long the clock is. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=140.68s)]
*  It's on Mike Johnson. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=144.16s)]
*  The future's undetermined. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=145.2s)]
*  Yeah, and they could end up having a major conflict over abortion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=147.24s)]
*  I mean, for Mike Johnson, he really believes that it should be a crime [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=151.44s)]
*  for someone to have abortion. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=155.88s)]
*  For Donald Trump, of course, he's completely flexible on the issue. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=157.24s)]
*  He used it in order to take over the Republican Party, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=160.84s)]
*  and he appointed radical anti-choice justices. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=163.96s)]
*  But at this point, he'd like to leave it alone [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=167.84s)]
*  because he knows how to read a poll. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=169.48s)]
*  So, it would be interesting to see what happens between the two of them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=171.2s)]
*  Mike Johnson's a true believer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=173.88s)]
*  I was reflecting today, as the voting was going on, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  that if he watched the Handmaid's Tale, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=177.68s)]
*  he would not be rooting for June Osborne. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=180.6s)]
*  He'd be rooting for Gilead the entire time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=183.2s)]
*  He comes from the religious right part of the party. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=186.12s)]
*  He worked for ADF, which is a sort of, you know, right-wing legal org [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=188.16s)]
*  that's brought a whole bunch of suits. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=192.04s)]
*  When a Louisiana newspaper, he wrote an op-ed in 2003 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=193.24s)]
*  decrying the Supreme Court striking down sodomy laws, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=196.68s)]
*  saying that prescriptions against sodomy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=200.32s)]
*  have deep roots in religion, politics and law. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=201.88s)]
*  When Louisiana instituted its abortion ban in June 2022, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=204.32s)]
*  breaking late yesterday, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=208.68s)]
*  the Department of Health informed abortion facilities in our state, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=209.76s)]
*  the right to life has now been restored, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  perform an abortion, get imprisoned at hard labor for one to 10 years, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=214.44s)]
*  and fined 10K to 100K. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=218.2s)]
*  What does it portend for democracy, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=220.28s)]
*  the defining feature of what happened to Emmer, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=222.6s)]
*  like the interaction between Emmer rising to the surface, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=225.24s)]
*  Trump being like, nope, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=228.72s)]
*  he's on the wrong side of the most important issue, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=230.44s)]
*  which is that he's not a coup abetter. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=232.16s)]
*  Emmer dropping out four hours later, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=234.72s)]
*  and then Mike Johnson, coup abetter, that's my guy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  What are the implications of that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=238.88s)]
*  Well, Trump vetoed Emmer. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=240.76s)]
*  He plucked Johnson out of obscurity [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=242.24s)]
*  and propelled him to the speakership. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=245.88s)]
*  You know, if we were to allow these people to take over the House, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=250.28s)]
*  the Senate and the White House, we would be where Hungary is today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=253.8s)]
*  It's illiberal democracy that they're interested in, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  tight control over the electoral process to make sure the results [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=260.6s)]
*  always move in an authoritarian direction, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=264.32s)]
*  and then cracking down on civil rights and civil liberties, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  the rights of women, they're profoundly anti-gay, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=269.56s)]
*  they're against the right of gay people to get married. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=272.8s)]
*  They would try to roll the clock back 50 years in America. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  That's really where they are at this point. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=278.72s)]
*  So the stakes have been drawn real clearly in terms of the 2024 election. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=281.56s)]
*  We've got the Democratic Party, the Party of Democracy and Freedom, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=286.56s)]
*  against the GOP, which has a bag of tricks in voter suppression, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=290.8s)]
*  gerrymandering of federal and state legislative districts, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=295.84s)]
*  right-wing judicial activism, the filibuster, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=299.44s)]
*  all of those things to try to prevent real democratic priorities. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's going to be the struggle against the theocrats [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=306.2s)]
*  and the autocrats and the kleptocrats, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=309.4s)]
*  and, you know, Vladimir Putin moving into the 2024 election. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=311.6s)]
*  Yeah, speaking about Vladimir Putin, we'll talk about that in a second [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  in our next guest about how that next piece of legislation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=318.0s)]
*  is going to look, Congressman Jamie Raskin, thank you very much. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rTke9nmoqo&t=320.76s)]
