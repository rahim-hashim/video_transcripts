Video Description: Chris Hayes: Joe Biden is a decent man who has done nothing wrong. He has not got caught in a scandal—he's just aging. And that makes him increasingly likely to lose re-election to a Republican candidate who's just a few years younger and has done lots wrong—and who has promised to do more if he wins.

# ‘This is not a scandal’: Biden hasn’t done anything wrong—he’s just aging
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes in the continuing media and political ass freakout over President Joe Biden's campaign for reelection. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=0.0s)]
*  There's one pretty important fact that gets missed almost entirely. And I've been thinking about it a lot. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=7.44s)]
*  The president has done nothing wrong. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=14.36s)]
*  You wouldn't know that from a lot of the coverage. Part of what has been weird and difficult about this news cycle day in day out is that Biden's political future is being covered like a scandal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Right. And we have seen plenty of presidential scandals in recent years. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=28.08s)]
*  We've seen a president get impeached twice in one term for behavior that's completely beyond any standard of decency or sanity, including attempting to end the American Constitutional Republic. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=32.16s)]
*  We've seen a civil jury conclude the ex president also sexually assaulted a woman and continually defamed her. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=40.96s)]
*  We've seen that former president indicted for election interference, convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=47.44s)]
*  And just to be clear again, Joe Biden has done nothing like that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=54.56s)]
*  As president, he's reached out to build a political coalition that has managed some really genuinely shocking policy victories, things I I truly didn't think were going to happen. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=60.24s)]
*  He held that coalition together long enough to pass the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure improvements, the first gun safety reforms in decades. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  He completed the long overdue U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=80.56s)]
*  It took heat for its chaotic execution. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=84.0s)]
*  And he's led America through the aftermath of covid incredibly difficult era and the best economic stewardship in the developed world with humility and industry. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=87.88s)]
*  So at the heart of all this, right, the heart of what we're talking about and we're talking about this story and the coverage of it is is not a scandal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=100.48s)]
*  There is no wrongdoing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=108.16s)]
*  The heart of it is the fact that an old man has gotten older and he's gotten older in ways that are not necessarily predictable because aging isn't after having the most stressful job in the world for three years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=112.24s)]
*  And it is very clearly taken a toll on him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=125.32s)]
*  We can all see that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=127.36s)]
*  And now in the next four months, he has to do the only thing that may be harder than being president, more stressful and more demanding, which is to be president while also running for reelection. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=129.68s)]
*  Those are both full time jobs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Beyond the incredible media feeding frenzy that feels like a scandal is the one various obvious question, which is at 81, having been the president now with all that stress, is President Biden capable of enduring the unbelievable [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  taxing task of running the country and being a candidate who can persuade unpersuaded American voters in order to defeat Donald Trump? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=158.68s)]
*  That is genuinely a difficult thing to do at any age, but particularly when you're 81. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=171.24s)]
*  The White House has tried to tamp down on all this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=178.0s)]
*  They've been reaching out to congressional leaders and trying to signal that it was kind of case closed, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=180.24s)]
*  All this talk after the debate of is Biden going to go or not? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=185.28s)]
*  Is he going to be the Democratic nominee? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=188.56s)]
*  That look, the process has run its course. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=190.28s)]
*  People could have run against him in the primary. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=192.44s)]
*  We're a month out from the convention. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=194.52s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  Everything's run its course. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=200.16s)]
*  Everything else is noise. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=201.0s)]
*  But ultimately, I think what is weighing very clearly in public and private on all members of the Democratic Party and the larger Democratic coalition, is Joe Biden's ability to run the campaign necessary [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=203.32s)]
*  to run against the headwinds he faces, part of which is questions about his age, and defeat the threat from Donald Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=214.92s)]
*  And again, we don't know the future, but the data we have right now does not look good. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=224.04s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=228.16s)]
*  And for anyone watching this right who's thinking that they're sick of the pundits and the no-dolls and also the stress of this hand wringing, I have found this pretty tough to cover and watch as well, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=230.48s)]
*  It is wrenching in a certain way, partly because the stakes are so high. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  But it's worth listening to some of the Democratic voices who are now expressing doubts publicly because they are people who have known Biden and the political stakes for years. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  And these people aren't glib. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  And they're not just like tossing off columns. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=258.4s)]
*  People like moderate Colorado Senator Michael Bennett, who on Tuesday night became the first Senate Democrat to just publicly say President Joe Biden can't win the election. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  He confirmed that he had told his colleagues as much in a private meeting on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=269.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=274.96s)]
*  And so for me, this isn't a question about polling. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=284.04s)]
*  It's not a question about politics. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=286.84s)]
*  It's a moral question about the future of our country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=289.24s)]
*  And I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=292.04s)]
*  Now, the bad Bennett interview stood out to me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=303.24s)]
*  He didn't actually call for Biden to step down, but you could kind of intuit that it stood out to me because in a Senate that's full of a lot of grandstanders and showbitters, Michael Bennett is not that he's not a guy who goes out of his way to get a ton of attention. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=305.6s)]
*  He's clearly saying this again in that kind of halting, anguished way because he believes it and because it's what, again, all the available data we have is showing right now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  Imperfect as it may be. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=329.6s)]
*  Now, in the past hour, Bennett's Democratic colleague, Senator Peter Welch of Vermont, published an opinion piece in The Washington Post calling for Biden to drop out of the race. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=331.68s)]
*  He's the first senator, I believe, on the record calling for that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=339.0s)]
*  This morning, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi weighed in. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=342.36s)]
*  Now, no one has more experience and more of a stake in leading Democrats to unify and get in line for the good of the party than Nancy Pelosi. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=345.6s)]
*  And here's what she said. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  Does he have your support to be the head of the Democrats again? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=355.68s)]
*  As long as the president had the president, it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=358.24s)]
*  We're all encouraging him to to make that decision because time is running short. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=364.44s)]
*  The I think overwhelming support of the caucus, it's not for me to say I'm not the head of the caucus anymore, but he's beloved. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=371.84s)]
*  He is respected and people want him to make that decision. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=382.64s)]
*  He has he has said he has made the decision. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=387.24s)]
*  He has said firmly this week he is going to run. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=389.56s)]
*  Do you want him to run? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=392.96s)]
*  I want him to do whatever he decides to do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=394.8s)]
*  And that's that's the way it is. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=397.64s)]
*  She didn't say Joe Biden is the guy. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=401.48s)]
*  I mean, she could have she very obviously and intentionally didn't say that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=404.20000000000005s)]
*  We all saw that. Right. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=409.0s)]
*  You saw what she was doing there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=410.32s)]
*  She said Joe Biden has to decide even though he's decided he still has to decide. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  It is a remarkable thing for Nancy Pelosi to say. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  In large part, because it's not a person who is caught up in news frenzies and new cycles. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  She's pushed back hard against similar Democratic panics in the past. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  She knows from them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  Remember back in 2009, I remember covering this as a nation correspondent in Washington, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=430.32s)]
*  D.C., when longtime Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy died and Massachusetts voters in a [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=434.56s)]
*  special election replaced him shockingly with a Republican that named Scott Brown. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=438.68s)]
*  And with that, it meant the Democrats had lost their filibuster, supposed to prove majority [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=444.48s)]
*  60 votes, which meant they could not pass Obamacare through the Senate again, had to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=449.56s)]
*  come back from Conference Committee. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=455.32s)]
*  And the party was utterly demoralized and shocked and in genuine disarray. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=456.76000000000005s)]
*  And pundits and politicians were saying that was it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=462.56s)]
*  We lost. That's the end of health care reform. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  We can't pass it through the Senate. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=467.72s)]
*  It's dead. It's dead. It's dead. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=469.04s)]
*  It was Barack Obama, first of all, and Nancy Pelosi, who just ignored the media drama and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=470.92s)]
*  ignored the hand-wringing and ignored the pundits, who whipped members on the phone [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  and who found the way forward and got that historic legislation passed by passing the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=481.12s)]
*  identical Senate bill through the House. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=485.92s)]
*  That was her. The following year, when President Obama signed Obamacare into law, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  remember what then Vice President Biden told him in earshot of the mic. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=493.6s)]
*  It was a big f-ing deal. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  And I say all this to demonstrate the fact that Nancy Pelosi has shown that kind of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=501.32s)]
*  hold the line savvy time and time and again over Democrats, whether it was waiting for [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=505.44s)]
*  the right time to open impeachment articles against Donald Trump or squeezing an [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=510.04s)]
*  infrastructure bill through warring party factions. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=513.64s)]
*  And the fact that Nancy Pelosi is now out there leaving the door open for Biden to do [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=517.6s)]
*  something other than run for reelection suggests to me she really thinks there is a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=520.72s)]
*  dire need for the party to do something dramatic and drastic and risky. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=524.84s)]
*  Let's be clear, risky, basically unprecedented, but to her mind and I think others [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=528.36s)]
*  necessary in the face of what's happening. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  And she's obviously hedging, but it speaks to the depth of people's concerns, especially [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=535.84s)]
*  among those who have known the president for years, like actor and Democratic activist [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=541.64s)]
*  George Clooney, who has been toasted by the president for the Kennedy Senate honors, who [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=545.84s)]
*  held a fundraiser for Biden just weeks ago. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=549.88s)]
*  And in a New York Times opinion piece today, Clooney declared it was time for Biden to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=552.6s)]
*  step down, writing, I love Joe Biden, he wrote. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  I consider him a friend and I believe in him, believe in his character, believe in his [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=559.28s)]
*  morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=562.36s)]
*  But the one battle he cannot win is a fight against time. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=566.6s)]
*  None of us can. It's devastating to say it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=568.88s)]
*  But the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago fundraiser was not the Joe big f***ing deal [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  Biden of 2010. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=575.76s)]
*  It wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=577.8s)]
*  He was the same man we witnessed at the debate. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=580.0s)]
*  We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=582.76s)]
*  We can speak the truth. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=585.12s)]
*  Joe Biden is a hero who saved democracy in 2020. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=586.72s)]

*  Joe Biden is a decent man who, like I said, has done nothing wrong. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=596.72s)]
*  He hasn't been caught in a scandal. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=601.72s)]
*  He is just aging. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=603.28s)]
*  And that reality makes him, I think, increasingly likely to lose reelection to a [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=606.36s)]

*  promised to do more wrong if he wins. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=625.76s)]
*  And again, there is no conversation about whether he should drop out because that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=628.2s)]
*  candidate's party is too afraid to ask him to step aside or do anything against [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qp8agOlu0&t=631.32s)]
