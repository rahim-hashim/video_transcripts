# Trump mocks his sexual assault accuser: ‘She would not have been the chosen one’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo)
*  Donald Trump and the rest of his legal team were in another New York courtroom today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=0.0s)]
*  this one in federal appellate court, arguing to overturn his E. Jean Carroll sexual abuse [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  verdict. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=9.4s)]
*  For nearly half an hour this morning, Trump set less than 20 feet away from Carroll as [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=10.4s)]
*  a panel of federal appellate judges heard arguments on why they should overturn the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=15.3s)]
*  jury's decision. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Once he returned to Trump Tower, Trump repeated some of the very same lines that got him into [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=21.32s)]
*  an $83 million hole. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=25.6s)]
*  But this case involved a woman who wrote a book, and I guess she said something in the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=27.68s)]
*  book. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=33.56s)]
*  That's when I first heard about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=34.56s)]
*  I first heard about it in the White House. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=35.56s)]
*  And of course, I denied the story because it's not true. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=37.68s)]
*  I have no idea who the woman is. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=41.4s)]
*  And I never met her. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=44.64s)]
*  As far as I know, I never met her. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=46.4s)]
*  I never touched her. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  I have, I would have had no interest in meeting her in any way, shape or form. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=52.4s)]
*  There was never a claim. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=59.31999999999999s)]
*  There was never a police report. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=61.08s)]
*  There was never anything mentioned. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  There was never publicity 30 or 40 years ago whenever it took place. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=64.96s)]
*  Now he knows very well from attending that trial regularly, Carroll says the assault [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=69.8s)]
*  took place 28 years ago in 1996. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  And not to take his denial too seriously, we should note that according to the Department [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  of Justice, nearly 70% of sexual assaults went unreported in the 1990s. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=78.6s)]
*  Despite his insistence, the case was fabricated and that E. Jean Carroll was lying. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=84.08s)]
*  Trump received full due process in the matter. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  There was a whole trial and everything. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Carroll's lawyers presented her case to a jury. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  And after hearing their arguments and the ex-president's defense, the jury believed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=95.44s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  They found that Trump was in fact liable for sexual abuse and then defaming her by saying [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  pretty much what you just heard him say there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=106.76s)]
*  Now we should note here, Trump did not need to be in court today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  You don't have to show up to your own appellate arguments. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=113.0s)]
*  Could have just let his lawyers handle it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=115.44s)]
*  Instead, he chose to be in the courtroom and to put on a spectacle flanked by lawyers in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  front of American flags, spending nearly an hour defaming E. Jean Carroll, the woman a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=120.76s)]
*  jury says he sexually abused. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  She says he raped her in a dressing room in Bergdorf Goodman. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=127.0s)]
*  Oh, and not just that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  He also spent some time insulting and attacking numerous other women because, again, there [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=133.64s)]
*  are many women who have accused him of sexual assault throughout the years, the kinds of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=139.44s)]
*  sexual assault he once bragged on on tape, including one who gave testimony in Carroll's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  case. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=148.64s)]
*  There were two witnesses. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=150.76s)]
*  One is a woman who's followed me for years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=153.04s)]
*  She said in 1979, I was in an airplane with her commercial flight and we became very intimate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=158.88s)]
*  Passengers are coming into the plane and she said I was making out with her and then after [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=169.04s)]
*  15 minutes and then she changed her story a couple of times, maybe it was quicker, that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  I grabbed her at a certain part and that was when she had enough. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  So think of the impracticality of this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=186.52s)]
*  I'm famous. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm in a plane. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  People are coming into the plane and I'm looking at a woman and I grab her and I start kissing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  her and making out with her. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  What are the chances of that happening? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=200.02s)]
*  What are the chances? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  And frankly, I know you're going to say it's a terrible thing to say, but it couldn't have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  happened. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=213.92s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=214.92s)]
*  And she would not have been the chosen one. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=216.6s)]
*  She would not have been the chosen one. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=220.6s)]
*  Just to be clear, when he says the chosen one, he means the person that I would choose [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=223.44s)]
*  to sexually assault. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=226.64s)]
*  That's what he means by chosen one. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=227.64s)]
*  She wouldn't have been the person I chose to sexually assault. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=229.76s)]
*  Of all the various defenses he's thrown out there, that last one there, which you can [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  see his lawyers visibly react to, which he has spouted before about Carroll and other [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  women is the most telling, that these women, victims of alleged sexual assault, are just [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=239.56s)]
*  not hot enough for him to rape. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdzWJXPYbo&t=243.92000000000002s)]
