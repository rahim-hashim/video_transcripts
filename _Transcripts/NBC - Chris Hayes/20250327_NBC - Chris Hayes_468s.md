# 'Incredible’: Trump admin reportedly deports man over autism awareness tattoo
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70)
*  One thing has become clear as Donald Trump battles the courts over his deportations of immigrants to El Salvador, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=0.0s)]
*  grabbing people off the street and rendering them to a foreign gulag with zero due process. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=6.0s)]
*  What's clear now is that the point of it all was to basically make content. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=12.0s)]
*  Trump and the government have eagerly shared videos and photos of shackled and forcibly shaved detainees to show they're doing something. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=18.0s)]
*  Gross violations of human rights being done to provide fascist propaganda. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=27.0s)]
*  Yesterday we saw the worst example yet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=32.0s)]
*  The Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, traveled to that gulag in El Salvador. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=35.0s)]
*  This is the photo opportunity that she traveled there to get. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=39.0s)]
*  It's a screenshot from a propaganda video that we're not going to show here because none of the prisoners stacked behind her like firewood consented to this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=42.0s)]
*  It's debasing and dehumanizing by design. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=49.0s)]
*  In the video, Noem said that this overseas jail where prisoners are being held without trials, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=53.0s)]
*  one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=57.0s)]
*  They claim they're deporting undocumented gang members, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=62.0s)]
*  but some just incredible new reporting from Mother Jones magazine suggests the American government is simply disappearing innocent people on the stupidest of pretext. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=65.0s)]
*  The magazine spoke with 10 families that disappeared Venezuelans who say their loved ones were abducted because the U.S. falsely accused them of having gang tattoos. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=77.0s)]
*  Noah Leonard is one of the Mother Jones reporters who spoke with the families of those detained Venezuelans and he joins me now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=86.0s)]
*  I just want to say Isabella Diaz is the co-author of this piece. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=94.0s)]
*  The two of you did incredible work. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=97.0s)]
*  This is some of the finest journalism I've read in the Trump era so far. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=99.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me on, Chris. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=102.0s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=104.0s)]
*  Let's start. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=105.0s)]
*  Talk about one of the people you managed to track down. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=106.0s)]
*  This is the family of Neri Alvarado. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=108.0s)]
*  Tell me about who Neri Alvarado is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=110.0s)]
*  So Neri Alvarado, he actually celebrated his 25th birthday a week ago in this gulag that you talked about in El Salvador. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=112.0s)]
*  He came to the United States last year from Venezuela. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=120.0s)]
*  He had been working in a bakery there and I talked with his sister and his boss and it was just immediately apparent just what a sweet man he is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=123.0s)]
*  His 15-year-old brother has autism. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=129.0s)]
*  He has an autism awareness ribbon tattooed on his leg. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=131.0s)]
*  He only has two other tattoos and this is part of the reason he was targeted. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=134.0s)]
*  One says brother in English, the other says familia, family. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=137.0s)]
*  And you talk to his sister and he says this is someone who wouldn't even hurt a fly. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=140.0s)]
*  His boss absolutely loved him, had invited him into his home many times, vouches for him 100 percent, yet he was taken in by ICE in early February and told explicitly, you're in here because of the tattoos you have. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=143.0s)]
*  Yeah, can we show that one again, Neri Alvarado? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=155.0s)]
*  This really broke me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=156.0s)]
*  This is a tattoo with his brother's name, Neri Olson, and that's the autism awareness sign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=157.0s)]
*  And that tattoo we think is part of what got this guy grabbed, deported, and stuck in a prison with a shaved head, stacked in those cells with zero way to get out because of that tattoo. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=166.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=178.0s)]
*  I mean, it is hard to believe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=179.0s)]
*  I mean, but we spoke with 10, like you said, 10 families. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=181.0s)]
*  All 10 of their relatives had tattoos. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=183.0s)]
*  You know, there might be some people who are sent there who didn't, but clearly they were targeting people who had these tattoos based on the idea that this is an evidence that you're in a gang. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=185.0s)]
*  But that is such pseudoscience basically, and especially in this case, these are obviously transparently not gang tattoos. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=193.0s)]
*  And what is so kind of infuriating about this is too that when he was taken to ICE's office in downtown Dallas, he was told, I was told by his sister and his boss, he recounted this one day later. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=199.0s)]
*  He said they told me I was clean. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=209.0s)]
*  They checked my phone. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=210.0s)]
*  I explained my tattoos. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=211.0s)]
*  They said it was fine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=212.0s)]
*  But then he went to another office and they said, you know what? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=213.0s)]
*  You're coming with us anyway. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=214.0s)]
*  And this was happening right at the time where the highest levels of the Trump administration were pushing for more and more bodies to put into detention centers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=215.0s)]
*  You also had someone else who was a singer, a relatively successful singer in Venezuela, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=222.0s)]
*  Yes, we had someone, Arturo Suarez. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=227.0s)]
*  I spoke with his brother and his wife, his wife, who lives in Chile. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=229.0s)]
*  They had first and got to think about this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=232.0s)]
*  These are Venezuelans. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=234.0s)]
*  Their country has completely collapsed. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=235.0s)]
*  So he had fled Venezuela nearly a decade ago in 2016. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=236.0s)]
*  First went to Colombia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=239.0s)]
*  Then Chile. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=240.0s)]
*  Then they were going to come to the U.S. together, him and his wife. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=241.0s)]
*  But turns out she was pregnant. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=242.0s)]
*  And so he went on his own. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=244.0s)]
*  He has a three month old baby girl who he has never met. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=245.0s)]
*  And now he is in this center in El Salvador. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=248.0s)]
*  He was an aspiring musician and people should check out his videos. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=251.0s)]
*  He recorded under the name Suarez VZ LA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=254.0s)]
*  They're really good videos. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=256.0s)]
*  He's a great musician. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=257.0s)]
*  I mean, just to be clear, like none of these people have criminal records in the United States. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=258.0s)]
*  They haven't been accused of any crime in the case of Nelson Suarez. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=263.0s)]
*  He had no criminal record. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=266.0s)]
*  In the other previous countries he was in. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=268.0s)]
*  And as far as we know, no criminal record in Venezuela itself. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=269.0s)]
*  Yes, it is really down the line. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=272.0s)]
*  Down the line. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=274.0s)]
*  I mean, and the only cases where we saw would be like if someone entered the country without inspection, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=275.0s)]
*  across the border without authorization, because they were unable to get an appointment to come to the official port of entry to request asylum. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=280.0s)]
*  Those were the only things that we could see. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=285.0s)]
*  Nothing violent, nothing even a car accident. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=287.0s)]
*  And these are again, you talk to family members. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=290.0s)]
*  And again, I can't vouch for whether or not they were in Venezuela. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=292.0s)]
*  And again, you talk to family members. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=295.0s)]
*  And again, I can't vouch for whether they're telling the truth and maybe they want to look out for people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=296.0s)]
*  But like it really seems that a significant number of these people, there's an example of a soccer player whose soccer tattoo was mistaken for a gang tattoo. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=300.0s)]
*  I read a story in the Miami Herald today of a married father who went to his own ice check in and was put on this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=309.0s)]
*  That like they were just kind of grabbing everyone with tattoos or not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=316.0s)]
*  Yes, I think they were grabbing basically anyone they could find. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=321.0s)]
*  And like I was saying, there was so much pressure too. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=324.0s)]
*  And there is still so much pressure. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=327.0s)]
*  And this is something that's still happening. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=328.0s)]
*  I'm in touch with someone else who ice arrested last week after the plane went to El Salvador and ISIS blasting his photo out on their Facebook and Instagram saying, you know, certified trend, their Agua member. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=329.0s)]
*  And now, you know, so this is continuing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=339.0s)]
*  And the only reason we don't have potentially more people going is because there's a court order right now that is blocking them from being sent to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, this extreme war power. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=341.0s)]
*  I mean, some of these family members only know that their loved ones are there because they saw them in the propaganda videos and recognized them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=350.0s)]
*  Yes, I think this is one of the most dystopian and horrifying aspects of this is, you know, when I first spoke to Enrique Neri's boss on Thursday, he wasn't sure he said, you know, I'm 90% sure he's there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=357.0s)]
*  And I'm 90% sure because he called us yesterday. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=368.0s)]
*  He said he was going to be deported out Venezuela. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=370.0s)]
*  No planes went to Venezuela. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=372.0s)]
*  The only planes went to El Salvador and we haven't heard anything from him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=373.0s)]
*  And he calls us every day. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=376.0s)]
*  So that's probably where he is. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=377.0s)]
*  But they hadn't been able to recognize him. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=378.0s)]
*  One of those photos later that day, CBS finally got a list of who's there and they got that confirmation. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=380.0s)]
*  But like you said, other people we knew, you know, Natalie Sanchez recognized her husband, the musician Arturo, because he has a tattoo of a hummingbird on his neck. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=384.0s)]
*  And she saw the photo and said, that's my husband's tattoo. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=392.0s)]
*  He was bent over. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=394.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=395.0s)]
*  I mean, I want just just so people understand what's happening here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=396.0s)]
*  This guy who's got an autism awareness tattoo, who came to the U.S. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=398.0s)]
*  for a better life and he was working in a bakery in Dallas, got grabbed by ICE with no due process, put on a plane. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=401.0s)]
*  He is now in one of the most notorious prisons in the world. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=407.0s)]
*  And there is no this man's 22. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=410.0s)]
*  There is no way for him to get out. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=412.0s)]
*  There is no way for him to get out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=414.0s)]
*  There's a prison that people talk about as a place where you don't get out of. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=416.0s)]
*  They don't let people out of. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=419.0s)]
*  And it's even like you said, you called it a gulag earlier. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=420.0s)]
*  You know, prison is a stretch here. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=422.0s)]
*  This is a place where people are stacked in bunks for high. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=423.0s)]
*  It's closer to a factory farm than it is to a prison. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=426.0s)]
*  It is not meant no human should be in this place of any kind. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=428.0s)]
*  It is no mattresses, no sheets, nothing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=432.0s)]
*  Noah Leonard, like I said, you and Isabella Garcia, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=435.0s)]
*  Isabella Diaz. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=439.0s)]
*  Isabella Diaz. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFeOFUC70&t=440.0s)]
