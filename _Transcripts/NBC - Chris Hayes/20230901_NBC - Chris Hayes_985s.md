# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 31
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk)
*  So Jared Kushner was a New York City rich kid, took over his daddy's business after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Christie threw him in the clink, and then he married Ivanka Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=4.4s)]
*  That is about all it took for him to get placed in one of the most powerful positions in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=8.68s)]
*  world, senior advisor to the president of the United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  One of the highest level jobs in the White House, Kushner had access to some of the nation's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=15.68s)]
*  top intelligence. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=19.96s)]
*  He dealt with all sorts of foreign governments, kind of parallel state department basically. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=20.96s)]
*  He oversaw U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East because why not? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=25.26s)]
*  He's my son-in-law. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=28.32s)]
*  But his relationship with Saudi Arabia stood out in particular in what happened six months [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=29.32s)]
*  after he left the government when his private equity fund received $2 billion with a B from [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=33.84s)]
*  the Sovereign Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, a fund chaired by the de facto leader, Crown [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=39.0s)]
*  Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=43.36s)]
*  While Republicans continue to obsess over Hunter Biden and whether he traded on his [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=45.92s)]
*  last name for access and money, there's a real question as to why did Jared Kushner get billions [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=49.68s)]
*  of dollars from MBS? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  And some Democrats are saying, well, let's see that guy's laptop. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=58.68s)]
*  Back in February, Congressman Jamie Raskin, ranking member of the Oversight Committee, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  sent a previously undisclosed letter to the Republican chair of the committee, James Comer, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=65.8s)]
*  urging him to join an investigation Democrats opened up into Kushner. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=69.52s)]
*  Comer ignored that letter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=73.44s)]
*  Today, Congressman Raskin is renewing that call, sending another letter to Comer asking [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=74.76s)]
*  for the chair to subpoena Kushner's investment firm, citing the quote, glaring likely violations [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=78.56s)]
*  of American law. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=84.42s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, Dental County of Maryland, serves as the ranking member of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=87.04s)]
*  the Oversight Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=88.68s)]
*  Congressman, what is your, what are you after here with your colleague on this committee? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=91.84s)]
*  Well, we've been trying to get this information for more than a year, Chris. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=97.2s)]
*  We know that Kushner pocketed $2 billion and a $25 million a year management fee from the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=103.48s)]
*  Saudi government and the UAE and the Qatar government have also kicked in money. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=113.08s)]
*  So there's more than $3 billion in there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=118.72s)]
*  We want to be able to reconstruct what exactly those countries got out of it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=123.56s)]
*  Remember that the Saudi Arabian Sovereign Wealth Fund advisors recommended against [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=128.74s)]
*  giving that money to Jared Kushner on the grounds that he was inexperienced and they [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=135.32s)]
*  were asking a ridiculous sum of money. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=142.1s)]
*  And their advisors were overruled by the homicidal crown prince himself, Mohammed bin Salman, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=144.9s)]
*  who of course had been essentially bailed out of his situation that he'd gotten himself [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=151.62s)]
*  into when he ordered the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi back in 2018. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=158.66s)]
*  So, you know, the Trumps did a lot for them and I think Donald Trump bragged about it, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=168.22s)]
*  said, saying, in essence, he saved the prince's posterior multiple times and he wanted to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=173.22s)]
*  continually remind him of that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=180.33999999999997s)]
*  Well, we know that Jared Kushner created a business the day after the Trump administration [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=182.66s)]
*  ended and within a few months he had brought home billions of dollars from the Saudi government. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  So we want all the information in the same way that the committee is going for all the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=195.46s)]
*  information about Hunter Biden, who, after all, never worked for the government, was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=200.02s)]
*  not in the Biden administration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=204.58s)]
*  He is the adult, emancipated son of President Biden. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=207.06s)]
*  They want all that information. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=210.86s)]
*  We should get the information about Jared Kushner, who's not just President Trump's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  son-in-law, but he was actually managing Middle East foreign policy at the time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=217.38s)]
*  You know, there's two details there that I had, one I had forgotten and one I didn't know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=225.06s)]
*  I had forgotten the excoriating recommendation from the Oversight Committee being like, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=229.74s)]
*  absolutely not, there's no reason to give this dude this money. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=234.82000000000002s)]
*  That was overridden, we think, personally by MBS. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  I'd forgotten that crucial detail. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=240.78s)]
*  I didn't know the $25 million management fee or whatever. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=242.9s)]
*  You're meaning like, it's not just the, you know, you get billions for your fund, but [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=246.94s)]
*  like the management fee that they're charging is a lot of money. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=250.58s)]
*  And that's like, that's like basically direct income for the guy running it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=253.66s)]
*  I mean, that looks like a straight up payoff to me, a quid pro quo, $25 million a year. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=258.42s)]
*  I mean, like, that's the interest you would have basically on a half a billion dollars [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=264.74s)]
*  that he's, you know, pocketing directly from Mohammed bin Salman, who was obviously expressing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  his gratitude to the Trump administration for going there first in Trump's foreign travels, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=275.94s)]
*  the cover up of the assassination of Khashoggi, for tilting towards Saudi Arabia in the Yemen [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  War and on and on. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  The Saudis basically got whatever they wanted. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=291.22s)]
*  Now the foreign emoluments clause, which we've talked about before, applies not just to the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=294.06s)]
*  president, but anybody holding an office or trust under the federal government. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=298.66s)]
*  So it's clear to me that if that two billion had gone to Kushner a few months before the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=303.66s)]
*  administration was over, that would be a direct violation of the foreign emoluments clause. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=312.3s)]
*  I think it's the same thing if the deal was made during the administration and the money [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=316.06s)]
*  just shows up a few months later. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=320.58000000000004s)]
*  It's like, you know, somebody paying a bribe to a city councilman, but they say, well, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  when you step down from the office, that's when you'll get paid. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  That's still a bribe. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=329.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=330.1s)]
*  But just to be clear, I mean, that's a huge difference. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=331.1s)]
*  You guys don't have evidence in your hands that that happened. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=333.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=335.38s)]
*  I mean, like, just to be clear, like there's tons of American officials that leave their [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=336.38s)]
*  position and go make a lot of money from all kinds of foreign governments, like, you know, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=339.46s)]
*  and defense contractors and all kinds of people in that town that's in the backdrop behind [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=344.38s)]
*  you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=350.38s)]
*  This is a particularly grievous example, but none of that's illegal per se. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=351.38s)]
*  You're saying you want to be, you want to see evidence such that you can convince yourself [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=357.05999999999995s)]
*  that didn't happen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=362.06s)]
*  Well, they are if we're talking about statutory bribery laws or conflict of interest laws. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=364.58000000000004s)]
*  But you know, I'm a purist and an originalist about the Foreign Government Amoluments Clause, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=370.78000000000003s)]
*  which says that nobody who holds an office or trust under the federal government shall [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=376.98s)]
*  receive from a king, a prince or a foreign state a payment of any kind whatever without [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=382.98s)]
*  the explicit consent of Congress. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  Even if we didn't know about an explicit quid pro quo, if he had gotten that money while [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=391.62s)]
*  he was in office, it would clearly violate the Foreign Amoluments Clause. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think that, you know, if the deal was made and he got it later, to me, that's a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=400.06s)]
*  distinction without a difference. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=404.18s)]
*  All right, Congressman Jamie Raskin, I have to say, Congressman, I do miss the bandana, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=405.54s)]
*  but I am very happy to see you looking so well. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=410.7s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=412.82s)]
*  I appreciate that, Chris. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=414.86s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=418.74s)]
*  As John Chris says, the front runner for the Republican presidential nomination is facing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=420.18s)]
*  an existential threat to his personal freedom and his explicit goal and the goal of the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  party he commands is to keep him out of prison, end to end American democracy as we know. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=427.5s)]
*  But today we saw another demonstration that there are limits to just how far he can bully [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=433.26s)]
*  Republicans into doing his bidding. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=438.46000000000004s)]
*  The last 24 hours or so, Trump posted video after video issuing orders for vengeance and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=441.14s)]
*  authoritarian retribution. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=446.74s)]
*  America is becoming a banana republic. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  My whole life I never got indicted or even thought about it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=452.5s)]
*  And now they're indicting me every chance they get. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=455.14s)]
*  They're trying to steal the election by interfering with the campaign. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=458.26s)]
*  And we are not going to let that happen. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=462.5s)]
*  Great American patriots who see what is happening to our country, and they're not going to allow [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=464.74s)]
*  it to continue to happen. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=470.64s)]
*  To the Democrats, I say, be careful what you wish for. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=472.66s)]
*  We will expose their corruption for history to see and justice will be done. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=476.98s)]
*  So keep on fighting. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=481.82s)]
*  I hope that Republican district attorneys and attorney generals throughout the country [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=482.94s)]
*  are closely watching the tremendous weaponization of justice that is being utilized against me. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=488.22s)]
*  Frankly, it's an eye for an eye or it's fight fire with fire. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=495.18s)]
*  To be clear, those are all different videos. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=501.06s)]
*  That wasn't just one long video. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=502.94s)]
*  He's just sitting in front of the camera and then just ranting and then they stop and then [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=504.26s)]
*  he rants again and they stop and they post it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=508.78s)]
*  And he seems to be almost single-mindedly focused, as you can see on the idea of retribution. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=511.26s)]
*  In an interview with Glenn Beck earlier this week, he pledged to lock up his political [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=515.78s)]
*  opponents if elected president. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=519.34s)]
*  You said in 2016, lock her up. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  And then when you became president, you said, we don't do that in America. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=525.66s)]
*  That's just not the right thing to do. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=528.38s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=530.3s)]
*  Do you regret not locking her up? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=531.58s)]
*  And if you're president again, will you lock people up? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=533.82s)]
*  Well, I'll give you an example. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=537.0600000000001s)]
*  The answer is you have no choice because they're doing it to us. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=540.34s)]
*  On social media, he is barking orders at House Republicans to impeach President Biden, writing, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=544.82s)]
*  quote, either impeach the bomb or fade into oblivion. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  They did it to us. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=551.82s)]
*  He also recently called for the impeachment of Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=553.1400000000001s)]
*  who of course indicted him and 18 of his confederates earlier this month. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=557.1400000000001s)]
*  As I've said again and again, one of the ways that MAGA operates is by cultivating [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=561.36s)]
*  an atmosphere of menace and threat, of physical violence as a proximate possibility. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=568.2s)]
*  Trump signals to his followers that intimidation and retribution are just inevitable tools [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=573.76s)]
*  in our civil society. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=579.6s)]
*  Don't look at me. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=582.36s)]
*  People are angry. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=583.36s)]
*  And he tries to give himself the trappings of plausible deniability. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=584.36s)]
*  It's very clear what he's doing and that his people are listening. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=588.0s)]
*  But maybe he doesn't command the fear and obedience of all Republicans like he think [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=592.18s)]
*  he does. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=595.28s)]
*  In Georgia, Republican legislators recently passed a law giving them the ability to do [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=597.1s)]
*  what Trump told them to. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=601.02s)]
*  This is before even Fonny Willis indicted. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=602.54s)]
*  And it is the ability to remove any DA, but specifically in this case, Fonny Willis, from [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=605.36s)]
*  her position as the Fulton County DA so that Trump could effectively walk on the charges. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=610.38s)]
*  Earlier this week, one Georgia State Senator told Steve Bannon that removing Willis using [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=617.0999999999999s)]
*  this newly passed law by the Republicans of the state was the only alternative to, get [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=621.64s)]
*  this, a full blown civil war to stop Trump's indictments. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=626.9s)]
*  Now that we've got 19 people who are facing the rest of their life in prison because they [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=632.9s)]
*  spoke out against an election. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=636.42s)]
*  I mean, you know, I told one senator, I said, listen, I said, we've got to put our heads [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  together and figure this out. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=644.0999999999999s)]
*  We need to be taking action right now, because if we don't, our constituencies are going [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=645.6s)]
*  to be fighting it in the streets. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=650.32s)]
*  Do you want a civil war? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=652.52s)]
*  I don't want a civil war. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=654.24s)]
*  I don't want to have to draw my rifle. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=655.72s)]
*  I want to make this problem go away with my legislative means of doing so. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=657.88s)]
*  And the first step to getting that done is defunding Fonny Willis. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=663.76s)]
*  I don't want violence. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=668.96s)]
*  I hate violence. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=669.96s)]
*  I'd hate to take my gun out and have to shoot someone in the head with it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=670.96s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=674.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't want you to be shot by all these people that might take their guns and shoot you, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=675.54s)]
*  their political enemies. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  That's not what I want to do. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=680.8399999999999s)]
*  Do you understand? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=682.1999999999999s)]
*  What do you think Donald Trump did in response to that video? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  He posted another video, same position, praising the guy talking about a civil war. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=687.56s)]
*  Highly respected Georgia State Senator Colton Moore deserves thanks and congratulations [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=694.24s)]
*  of everyone for having the courage and conviction to fight the radical left lunatics who are [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=699.48s)]
*  so badly hurting the great state of Georgia and, frankly, the USA itself. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=705.48s)]
*  Now as we've been following us in our coverage, it's been a kind of open question, right? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=711.62s)]
*  Georgia Republicans passed this law, gave them the power to remove district attorneys. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=717.7s)]
*  Would they use it to go along with the scheme to remove D.A. Willis? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=721.26s)]
*  But there's also, as much as Trump wants them to, and obviously there's noise about it, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=726.46s)]
*  there's also this other factor, which is there is something different about the upper [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=729.74s)]
*  echelon of Georgia Republican officials. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=733.68s)]
*  And it's not that they're necessarily different in principle or character. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=736.92s)]
*  What is different is that they very much understand that they represent an emerging purple state. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=740.4s)]
*  They understand that Donald Trump is a political albatross around their necks who just, in [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=746.66s)]
*  a cold calculating sense, hurts their chances of winning majorities among swing voters. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=752.04s)]
*  They have seen this brute fact in action over and over and over again. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=758.62s)]
*  In the state of Georgia, where there is currently a hand recount being done, Joe Biden is the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=764.7s)]
*  apparent winner. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=769.62s)]
*  Again, Joe Biden, the apparent winner in Georgia. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=770.9s)]
*  NBC News now projects Raphael Warnock as the winner in the special Georgia Senate election [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=774.3000000000001s)]
*  tonight. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=782.98s)]
*  NBC News now projecting that John Ossoff, the Democrat, will win the Senate runoff in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=784.48s)]
*  the state of Georgia. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=790.36s)]
*  And that leads to the projection that Democrats will regain control of the U.S. Senate. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=792.2s)]
*  NBC News can now project that the winner of the Georgia U.S. Senate election tonight is [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=803.24s)]
*  And after these Georgia Republicans, like Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=807.52s)]
*  Brad Raffensperger, refused to help Donald Trump pull off his coup in 2020, he did what [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=810.68s)]
*  he always does, right? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=815.8599999999999s)]
*  The same thing we saw him braying about in those videos. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  He vowed vengeance and retribution. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=819.42s)]
*  And in this case, he did it by endorsing primary challengers to both men. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=822.3599999999999s)]
*  Former Georgia Senator David Perdue, the one who lost in 2020, in no small part because [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=826.26s)]
*  of Trump, he ran against incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp in the primary. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=832.6999999999999s)]
*  He lost by a whopping comical 52 points. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=837.34s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=840.88s)]
*  That's like a Saddam Hussein in Iraq kind of election, okay? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  Former Georgia Congressman Jody Heiss, who declined to run again the congressional safe [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=848.7s)]
*  seat so he could go and primary Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was also [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  a big enemy of Trump in Trump's view, lost by a still whopping, though less comical, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=857.4200000000001s)]
*  19 points. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=862.12s)]
*  So people like Kemp and Raffensperger are in this unique position. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=864.38s)]
*  They don't have anything to fear politically from Donald Trump. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=869.1s)]
*  The implicit threat that he controls his base, his followers will defeat you in a primary [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=872.82s)]
*  challenge if you don't do his bidding, didn't work. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=876.42s)]
*  Donald Trump came for them and they defeated him in political combat. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=879.58s)]
*  They didn't just defeat him, they kicked his butt. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=883.18s)]
*  They are now unburdened. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=886.54s)]
*  They rightly understand that the four times he died, he was twice impeached. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=887.78s)]
*  And so with all that context today, Brian Kemp came out and he answered the question, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=891.42s)]
*  at least for now, of what Georgia Republicans would do about Fonny Willis by effectively [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=914.62s)]
*  telling Donald Trump to take a hike. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=919.58s)]
*  We're going to follow the law and the Constitution, regardless of who it helps or harms politically. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=949.58s)]
*  And in Georgia, we will not be engaging in political fear that only inflames the emotions [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=957.4200000000001s)]
*  of the moment. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtQBFeh40Qk&t=963.32s)]
