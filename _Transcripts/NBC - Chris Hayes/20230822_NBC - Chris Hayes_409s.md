# Hayes: How the ‘hermetically-sealed’ MAGA world views Trump vs. Biden
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI)
*  One of the key things to understand as we head into the first debate tomorrow is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=0.0s)]
*  the Republican primary or Republican presidential politics is not actually entirely about Donald [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=3.74s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=9.86s)]
*  It is as much about President Joe Biden and the way that the hermetically sealed conservative [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  universe understands and depicts Joe Biden. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=16.92s)]
*  In their minds, the president is both a venal and preposterous figure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=20.16s)]
*  He's the corrupt head of the so-called Biden crime family who has been unbeknownst to anyone [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=24.88s)]
*  apparently taking illegal bribes for years, just not caught. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=29.96s)]
*  Of course, there's no evidence that's true. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=33.04s)]
*  But according to conservatives, the president is also a national laughing stock. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=36.2s)]
*  He's a feeble old man being propped up by aides who everyone thinks is incompetent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=39.32s)]
*  Well, I think they're all alarmed at the president's condition. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=44.6s)]
*  He's obviously senile. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  He's faltering. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=51.72s)]
*  It's not going to get better between now and election day and beyond. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=52.72s)]
*  Wouldn't the energy levels on that stage between the former president and the current [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=57.44s)]
*  president be pretty shocking for viewers? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=62.12s)]
*  Well, they might be, Mike. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=64.92s)]
*  Oh, the former president is like a year and a half younger. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=67.72s)]
*  That one, the 78-year-old. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  This perception of Joe Biden, feeble and venal and ridiculous all at the same time, is so [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=73.2s)]
*  ingrained, so taken for granted in conservative media. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=79.28s)]
*  There's just no room for any other understanding of the man or his political appeal or the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=83.76s)]
*  tens of millions of people who voted for him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  We have such a great new example of that in a video posted by the Republican National [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=91.84s)]
*  Committee's opposition research team. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=96.68s)]
*  They're supposed to find the gotcha quotes, like, oh, look at this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=99.04s)]
*  This is a moment from President Biden's trip to the devastated island of Maui. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  And to be clear, the RNC thinks this clip makes Joe Biden look bad. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=107.44s)]
*  What's the boss's name? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=112.72s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=114.72s)]
*  How you doing, pal? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=116.72s)]
*  You guys catch the boots out here? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=128.72s)]
*  That's some hard ground, man. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=132.72s)]
*  Now, I think most people watch that and think, that's a nice moment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=135.72s)]
*  The president obviously likes dogs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=140.72s)]
*  He's concerned about the dog's welfare. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=142.72s)]
*  It's hot there in the fire area. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=143.72s)]
*  And I think most Americans like dogs, too. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=146.72s)]
*  But Republicans posted this like, get a load of this loser. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=149.72s)]
*  They have zero idea, truly zero, like, intuitive, subjective sense of how anyone could like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=154.72s)]
*  the guy, how anyone could vote for him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=162.72s)]
*  And you can see their complete and utter confidence in this recent polling from NBC News [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=164.72s)]
*  and the Des Moines Register. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=170.72s)]
*  Sixty-five percent of likely Iowa Republican caucus goers say that a president who comes [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=172.72s)]
*  closest to them on the issues is most important to them, versus 29 percent who say they are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=176.72s)]
*  most concerned with picking a candidate who has the best chance of beating President Biden. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=181.72s)]
*  And the reason for that is they're not prioritizing electability, and this shows up in all [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=185.72s)]
*  polling, because they're not worried about it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=189.72s)]
*  They are not worried they're going to lose to Joe Biden. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=191.72s)]
*  They think anyone can beat Joe Biden. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=193.72s)]
*  Now, you could say that this is not just, you know, conservatives. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=197.72s)]
*  You can say the same was true of liberals who couldn't understand how anyone would vote [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=203.72s)]
*  for Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=208.72s)]
*  But of course, Trump managed to win the election quite infamously, despite losing the pot [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=209.72s)]
*  per vote by several million votes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=214.72s)]
*  And that shock precipitated four straight years of reckoning as countless journalists [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=215.72s)]
*  from mainstream to progressive, center, center-left, establishment, anti-establishment, all [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=220.72s)]
*  did the same reporting, asked how they missed Donald Trump's appeal. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=225.72s)]
*  They talked to Trump voters over and over and over again, kind of a punchline, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=228.72s)]
*  Like the Trump supporter in the diner who says they still like Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=233.72s)]
*  How much the media wrestled with this, how much they obsessed over it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=236.72s)]
*  But it did at least represent a needed correction to the overconfidence a lot of people were [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=240.72s)]
*  on the left and center left had before that election. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=244.72s)]
*  That reckoning has never happened on the right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=248.72s)]
*  You would think that that reckoning would have come when their beloved God King, Donald [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=253.72s)]
*  Trump, lost to the guy they think is a ridiculous, senile joke, Joe Biden, in 2020. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=258.72s)]
*  And that election was not close. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=265.72s)]
*  Donald Trump lost by five points almost, four and a half, seven and a half. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=267.72s)]
*  Seven million votes and four and a half points. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=273.72s)]
*  He lost by a wider margin than a whole bunch of other loser Republicans from Herschel [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=275.72s)]
*  Walker to David Ferdinand to Kelly Loeffler and Martha McSally. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=280.72s)]
*  You never hear about those people, do you? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=284.72s)]
*  Anymore. You know why? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=286.72s)]
*  Because they were losers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=288.72s)]
*  They lost, so no one cares what they think about politics. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=290.72s)]
*  Donald Trump got his butt kicked way harder than they did. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=294.72s)]
*  This is why Donald Trump's big lie is so important, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=299.72s)]
*  Along with the cult of personality still surrounding him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=303.72s)]
*  It's key to understanding this weird phenomenon, the Republican Party, the politics at this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=306.72s)]
*  moment, the vehemence with which conservatives still insist the 2020 election was rigged. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=312.72s)]
*  It protects them from this reckoning. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=318.72s)]
*  There's no way the American people actually chose Joe Biden as their president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=320.72s)]
*  He never left his basement. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=324.72s)]
*  It's a kind of psychological defense mechanism. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=326.72s)]
*  They don't want to accept that the man they are so devoted to is a loser. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=328.72s)]
*  And deeper down, I think it's also an expression of the belief that people who voted for Joe [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=333.72s)]
*  Biden aren't really the real Americans. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=337.72s)]
*  They don't really count. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=340.72s)]
*  The MAGA folks are the ones who should be running this country, even if they're outnumbered. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=341.72s)]
*  The big lie and the cult of personality surrounding Trump keeps the ruse going that he won and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=345.72s)]
*  that Joe Biden is a loser when it's the other way around. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=350.72s)]
*  That way, conservatives don't have to deal with the reality that Republican politics [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=353.72s)]
*  are minority politics. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=357.72s)]
*  When the nation en masse comes out to vote, they're on the losing side over and over and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=359.72s)]
*  over again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=364.72s)]
*  The only way to pierce Donald Trump's hole in the party is to convince some significant [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=365.72s)]
*  portion of the Republican primary electorate of the basic fact that the man is a loser. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=369.72s)]
*  He is a bigger loser than many of his fellow Republicans in 2020. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=375.72s)]
*  He's an even bigger loser than Mitt Romney was in 2012. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=378.72s)]
*  If there's a first step to breaking Trump's grip on the party, it's hammering the simple [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=383.72s)]
*  truth. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdrEYPpBgJI&t=387.72s)]
