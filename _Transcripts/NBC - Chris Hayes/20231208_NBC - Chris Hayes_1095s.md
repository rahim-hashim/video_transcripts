# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Dec. 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0)
*  The president's son, Hunter Biden, who's already been charged, who had charges brought against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=0.0s)]
*  him by a prosecutor in Delaware. It looked like they were going to come to a plea agreement. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=6.88s)]
*  The judge in that rejected that plea months ago. We went back to square one that that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=11.52s)]
*  U.S. attorney was elevated to be a special prosecutor who's now brought some felony charges [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=16.7s)]
*  against him for a felony possession of a gun. We got new news tonight that there are additional [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  tax charges, three federal felony tax charges against Hunter Biden. These are coming out [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=27.7s)]
*  of a California district. I think that's probably where he was living at the time. Failure to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=33.22s)]
*  file and pay taxes, evasion of assessment, false or fraudulent tax return, failure to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=37.26s)]
*  file and pay taxes. Your thoughts on that? I think this has been somewhat of a debacle [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=41.46s)]
*  for the Justice Department and the special prosecution. It really looks like they're [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  punishing him for their messy plea bargaining ability and a failure to resolve it. With [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  this kind of a tax charge, and we're not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in evasion, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=60.04s)]
*  the fact that he had already paid it back, that usually will absolve the person of the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=65.48s)]
*  criminal charges here. But these charges were not unexpected. The plea fell apart, so theoretically [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=71.4s)]
*  everything that you were trying to resolve with the plea comes back. Just for context, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=76.32s)]
*  people that don't know tax law would be astounded by the insane abrogation you can have of paying [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  your taxes that are not dealt with criminally and are basically worked out in the civil system or [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=89.48s)]
*  through negotiations. Huge amounts of money. You've got to really go out of your way. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=95.48s)]
*  Very high bar for criminal prosecution of tax charges. That's right. What I remember from the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=100.44s)]
*  earlier proceedings, Chris, as our colleague at NBC News, Tom Winter, saying to the extent that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=106.84s)]
*  the Hunter Biden case reflects a two-tiered system of justice, it's that it disfavored Hunter Biden. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=111.48s)]
*  Even at the stage where we were expecting both a plea agreement and a diversion on the gun charges, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=117.0s)]
*  there were people who thought even that was too harsh. So now that he's subject to not one, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=122.12s)]
*  but two indictments, one in the District of Delaware and now this new tax indictment in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  California, I think that really thoroughly deflates the Trumpian argument that there are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=132.12s)]
*  two systems of justice and Donald Trump is the one disfavored by it. Lisa Rubin, who is not here [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=136.6s)]
*  at this table because of the first night of Hanukkah, thank you so much for making some time [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  and happy Hanukkah. Shan Wu, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Good evening from New York. I'm [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=144.52s)]
*  Chris Hayes. We are just a few weeks from the first votes, actual votes being cast in the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=150.84s)]
*  early nominating contest for the presidential election. And one of the main points of discussion, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=156.12s)]
*  central focuses heading into this election centers around the economic well-being of our country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=161.88s)]
*  That's because, generally speaking, how people feel about the economy writ large is largely [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=168.2s)]
*  predictive of how an incumbent president will perform if and when they run for reelection. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=173.4s)]
*  A lot of people have noticed that there is a strange paradox at the center of our economy, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=178.68s)]
*  which is that if you look at many, if not most of the empirical metrics, the economy is doing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=182.92s)]
*  surprisingly well. If you look at economic sentiment, however, how people feel about the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=188.92s)]
*  economy, the numbers are near historically pessimistic. There is a real gap between how [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  the economy is actually doing, at least based on most of the measurements we normally use, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=200.6s)]
*  and how people think the economy is doing, or I should say at the very least, how they tell [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=206.2s)]
*  pollsters they feel about it. You can see it here on this chart. You see how the blue line, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=211.72s)]
*  how you'd expect people would feel about economic numbers and the red line, how they actually feel, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=216.68s)]
*  have usually been in sync. When things get worse, people feel worse. When they get better, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=221.88s)]
*  people feel better. Right now, there's a huge gulf between them. That gulf, it is worth noting, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=225.72s)]
*  does not exist in similar wealthy countries like France and Germany and the UK. It's only here, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=232.68s)]
*  even though we're doing a lot better than those places. And because of this, this huge debate is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=238.36s)]
*  broken out about how to explain this fundamental gap. Now, one argument is that people feel so [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=243.08s)]
*  badly about the economy because, well, they're still frustrated by the experience of the last [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=249.4s)]
*  few years or that there are certain things like housing prices right now that are still very high. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=254.84s)]
*  And it's true. Housing prices are high right now, and that's hard. Others argue that Americans are [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=259.48s)]
*  just getting inundated with negative messaging about the economy. Now, I've got to say, I'm [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=265.48s)]
*  definitely very invested in understanding this phenomenon, but it's worth actually taking a step [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=270.28s)]
*  back just to kind of look at the actual economic record of the incumbent president. What sort of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=274.28s)]
*  circumstances has he inherited? What has he accomplished independent of the public perception? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=279.55999999999995s)]
*  Let's look at how we got to where we are now. The theme of the Biden presidency has been inheriting [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  a succession of essentially unprecedented crises, crises that have afflicted the entire world and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=291.96s)]
*  have produced way worse economic outcomes in other pure countries. I mean, the source of all this, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=297.64s)]
*  of course, right, the original sources that we had, as you might remember, a once in a century [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=303.4s)]
*  pandemic globally that killed millions of people, shut down most of the world economy, shut down [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=308.2s)]
*  entire industries, and then we tried to come back out of it. That's the basic thing to remember. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=314.2s)]
*  Now, as president, you get credit for things when things are good. You get blamed on when things [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=319.8s)]
*  are bad, even if they're out of your control in both directions. I mean, we saw this in 2019 when [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=324.76s)]
*  Donald Trump had done essentially nothing to help the American economy. In fact, tried his best to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  hurt it with those massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations in a ridiculous trade war, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=334.76s)]
*  but he still presided over an economy that was finally recovering after financial crisis a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=340.92s)]
*  decade later, and he got the credit for it. We also saw it in 2020 to a certain extent [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=345.4s)]
*  when COVID annihilated the U.S. economy and the incumbent president, Donald Trump, lost. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  And once Joe Biden took over, basically from the very moment he was sworn in, we became inundated [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  with negative messaging about the economy. Some of it, a lot of it was rooted in real crises the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=361.8s)]
*  administration had to tackle. A lot of it was overhyped. Now, this collective freakout about [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=367.48s)]
*  the economy happened across the media ecosystem, but it was most pronounced on Fox News. I think [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=373.48s)]
*  it's worth taking a look at what exactly Americans have been hearing about the economy over the past [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=379.24s)]
*  three years and compare that with the actual circumstances and crucially, how the Biden [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=383.48s)]
*  White House responded, right? They inherit the circumstance, how they respond is up to them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=388.52s)]
*  Let's start with the issue of labor, of workers. Biden took office amid an unprecedented global [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  pandemic. Remember, there was not even a widely available vaccine when he was sworn in. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=400.04s)]
*  As a result, the Biden administration continued the economic stimulus from the Trump [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=404.92s)]
*  pandemic response, right? They passed on a party line vote, the American rescue plan, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=409.0s)]
*  huge, huge, huge amount of aid to families directly included additional direct cash payments, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=413.48s)]
*  an additional $300 a week in unemployment benefits. This was a big risk. Let's remember. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=418.68s)]
*  And Fox's response to labor shortages, which were real amid a deadly global pandemic, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=424.6s)]
*  was that suddenly no one wanted to work anymore. Biden created a labor shortage because he gave [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=430.92s)]
*  workers way too much free money. 183,000 people dropped out of the labor force. Biden created a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=437.72s)]
*  labor shortage. Labor shortage. Labor shortage. An 81 year old woman pitches in during the nationwide [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  labor shortage. They just can't find people. With the labor shortage, your people are making [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=450.36s)]
*  more money to stay home. They're bringing out the robots. Now, some businesses had trouble finding [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=454.6s)]
*  workers. It was a real challenge for the White House, especially when the Delta variant hit [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  that summer and more than 100,000 people were still being hospitalized every week. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  But then what happened? Well, the Biden administration continued its vaccination [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=467.96s)]
*  campaign. The virus subsided in its acuity to a level where people were comfortable going to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=471.56s)]
*  work in person. Equally as important, the bold agenda of economic stimulus really worked. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=477.08s)]
*  Unemployment rates dropped massively from 6.3% when President Biden took over to 3.9% in the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=483.56s)]
*  last jobs report. Again, you can see it right there on the chart. That's a chart that you want [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=490.12s)]
*  to go down, right? That's the unemployment rate. You want it to go down. And you don't need to be [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=495.0s)]
*  an economist to understand that the line did just that. People definitely do want to work. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=501.32s)]
*  It's a hot job market. So, okay, Fox mostly moved off the nobody wants to work anymore narrative. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=506.36s)]
*  Once the jobs numbers improved and it was clear people did not work. Then there was a new boogeyman [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=512.76s)]
*  in town, the supply chain. Now, again, to be clear, these issues were very, very real, again, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=517.4s)]
*  especially in the aftermath of COVID, which disrupted just about everything. Fox took the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=522.68s)]
*  opportunity starting all the way back in October 2021, spinning the yarn that Biden was both [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=528.3599999999999s)]
*  responsible for the supply chain issues and apparently doing it to room Christmas for [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=533.4799999999999s)]
*  America's children. The Christmas presents you want probably stuck on a ship somewhere. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  Economists are warning many Christmas presents for your kids. They're not going to be arriving in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=544.68s)]
*  time. The holidays have been harder this year for many Americans thanks to Joe Biden. Can we call [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=549.08s)]
*  Joe Biden Scrooge or the Grinch yet? The Grinch who stole Christmas. The Grinch who stole Christmas [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=553.88s)]
*  and American greatness. Democrats are going to be stealing our children's future. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=558.84s)]
*  Just like the Grinch in the middle of the night slithering around those presents. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=564.5200000000001s)]
*  You get that? You got the comparison to the Grinch, the famous Dr. Seuss character who [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  ruins Christmas. The months before Fox started its latest war on Christmas, President Biden had [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=572.12s)]
*  already put together this task force to combat the supply chain issues. By the fall, he announced [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=577.08s)]
*  that the Port of Los Angeles will be working 24-7 to clear the backlog as well as additional [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  investments from UPS and FedEx to make sure packages got moving. By November, the heads of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=586.44s)]
*  a bunch of major retail companies were shouting from the rooftops that there was no supply chain [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=591.64s)]
*  issue affecting holiday shopping. In fact, holiday spending in 2021 grew nearly 15% from the year [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=596.0400000000001s)]
*  before, shattering all kinds of records. Crisis averted, the presents were under the tree. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=602.52s)]
*  To be clear, it was not just Christmas presents. Early last year, the Biden administration was [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=608.36s)]
*  also dealing with a very real and very scary shortage of baby formula. It put together another [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=612.28s)]
*  plan to increase supply and fix allocation issues which were caused both by a shuttered factory and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=618.6s)]
*  a product recall. The White House later declared that production had actually increased year over [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=624.04s)]
*  year under their watch. By October, shell stock rates were back where they were before the crisis [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=629.4s)]
*  started. Okay, so by this point, Biden's been president for two years. The midterm elections [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=634.52s)]
*  were approaching. Republicans didn't have a ton to run on, especially after that Dobs decision [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=639.16s)]
*  struck down abortion rights. Their best hope, the central hope, was to run on the economy and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  specifically inflation, which really had been spiking for a whole bunch of reasons, including [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=648.76s)]
*  around the world and partly because of a hot labor market, as well as those lingering disruptions in [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=653.56s)]
*  the pandemic. And Fox News did its level best to act as the messaging arm of the Republican Party, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=659.24s)]
*  spending day after day after day talking about eggs. Egg prices for the month of December up 60%. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=664.6s)]
*  59.9% on eggs. Eggs now are through the roof. The price of eggs. Prices on eggs. Egg prices. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=675.16s)]
*  Eggflation is real. Eggs are so expensive. The egg has become so expensive, no more Easter eggs. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=681.96s)]
*  Everybody I know is getting chickens so they can have their own eggs. Now, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=689.32s)]
*  eggflation is actually an interesting case in that it really wasn't about broader inflation at all. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=693.8s)]
*  In early 2022, an avian flu outbreak killed tens of millions of egg laying chickens. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=697.96s)]
*  Yet another example of the supply crunch out of the president's control. Guess what? The ship [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=703.24s)]
*  corrected course. Farmers were able to raise new chickens. Egg prices came right back down. Your [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=707.88s)]
*  omelet is not in danger. But believe it or not, eggs were not the primary target of Fox's breathless [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=712.6s)]
*  inflation coverage. No, Fox saved the big guns for perhaps the most salient political issue of our time. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=718.2s)]
*  Let's talk about the pain at the pump. We're paying some of the highest gas prices per gallon [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=726.44s)]
*  in American history. At another daily record high. Gas prices are through the roof. Gas prices are [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=730.76s)]
*  through the roof. Gas prices are through the roof. Gas prices are now through the roof. Gas prices [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=736.44s)]
*  are through the roof. Gas prices are through the roof. Pain in the gas. Gas prices surging. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=741.08s)]
*  The Republicans and their allies in the media were nothing if not on message. Again, the 2022 [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=745.4s)]
*  midterms were supposed to be about one issue. Inflation specifically at the pump where you see [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=751.56s)]
*  the prices every day. And in theory, that should have been a pretty clear attack. After all, there [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=756.76s)]
*  was a major land war in Europe, any mass blockade of Russian oil and oil prices really, really went [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=760.36s)]
*  up. At one point, gas was averaging more than five bucks a gallon. Did Joe Biden cause that? No, he [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=767.24s)]
*  did not. Does it matter? Well, this single-minded campaign message was not particularly effective, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=771.88s)]
*  especially when being delivered by some truly terrible candidates. And the big red wave did [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=777.32s)]
*  not materialize. So you've got to think that many voters simply did not blame the Democrats for high [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=782.36s)]
*  gas prices, even after months of folks plastering stickers of President Biden labeled, I did that at [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=787.56s)]
*  gas pumps. Those stickers, by the way, might be sending quite the different message these days. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=792.76s)]
*  I mean, for better or for, in my opinion, worse, domestic oil production is booming under President [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=798.84s)]
*  Biden. We're producing more oil than Saudi Arabia and Russia. And guess what? Gas prices are way down [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=804.92s)]
*  from their highest peak last year. The national average is hovering at about $3.22 a gallon, the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=810.6s)]
*  lowest in nearly a year following a steady decline. And that tracks with all kinds of prices. Inflation [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=815.96s)]
*  has cooled dramatically over the past year, with rates steadily declining from a peak of about [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=822.36s)]
*  9% last year down to about 3.2%. So again, you don't really hear Fox News talking too much about [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=827.56s)]
*  the price of gas these days or the price of eggs or Christmas presents. And so the story of the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=833.88s)]
*  Biden presidency so far has been almost like this series of metaphorical meteors hitting the earth, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  unexpected, in many cases unprecedented crises, that the White House had to attend to. And each [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=845.2399999999999s)]
*  one has caused huge cycles of negative coverage, enormous around-the-clock panic across the media. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=851.2399999999999s)]
*  And in basically every case, the Biden administration has attempted to do something [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=857.56s)]
*  about the problem. In many cases, they saw real, tangible success, which is to say, in most cases, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  they just quietly did their job. Then they moved on to the next crisis. But that is not the message [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=867.4s)]
*  getting through on Fox News. Now, the message on Fox is that the entire economy is going to collapse [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=872.8399999999999s)]
*  any minute now. First, let me say for the record, it's a recession. I'm telling you, it's a recession. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  If it smells like a recession, it walks like a recession, it's a recession. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=884.2s)]
*  We begin tonight with the Biden recession. The Biden recession. The Biden recession. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=888.6800000000001s)]
*  The Biden recession. The auto industry is in recession. The housing industry is in recession. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=893.24s)]
*  Retail is in recession. Advertising is in recession. Recession, it's a certainty. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  We have dismal consumer and business confidence because we're hearing recession, recession, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=903.72s)]
*  recession. Well, that's interesting because she's right at one level. The dismal confidence is [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=909.0s)]
*  probably because they're hearing recession, recession, recession, except there is no imminent [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=914.92s)]
*  recession. According to a recent survey of business economists, the overwhelming majority of them, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=918.76s)]
*  more than 75%, do not believe that a recession is likelier than not. In fact, the fundamentals of [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=923.48s)]
*  the economy are much sounder than you might think they are. GDP is absolutely booming. Even more [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=930.6s)]
*  importantly, this is central, real wages are rising. That means wages right now are rising [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=937.0s)]
*  faster than inflation, which means working people have more purchasing power. In fact, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=942.52s)]
*  the largest wage gains have happened in the bottom 40% of workers. From the bottom up, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=947.16s)]
*  the certain recession is now far from certain. It may even appear unlikely, which itself is a [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=954.68s)]
*  minor miracle. We are left in this weird environment where people do genuinely feel very bad about the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=960.28s)]
*  economy. I'm not telling anyone how to feel or what their finances are. People feel how they feel. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=965.4s)]
*  If they're stressed, they're stressed. Housing prices are fine. That's true. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=970.28s)]
*  But as I said, the weird thing about presidents, the way that credit and blame work in the public [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=973.9599999999999s)]
*  consciousness, presidents get blamed for the bad stuff, praised for the good, even when, say, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=977.56s)]
*  the Fed had more to do with cooling inflation than the White House does. But I also think that from [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=981.88s)]
*  the perspective of economic management, dealing with what's dealt you, President Biden is just [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=987.16s)]
*  not getting the praise he deserves. If you are evaluating presidential performance, you've got to [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=992.2s)]
*  keep the rules consistent. Donald Trump and his buddies on Fox want to praise him for the great [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=997.1600000000001s)]
*  economy from 2017 through 2019 while ignoring the 2020 disaster that unfolded under his watch. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1002.36s)]
*  They want you to believe Trump's term only lasted three years, and then he just disappeared [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1008.36s)]
*  before Biden took over and a bunch of bad stuff happened under his watch. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1013.1600000000001s)]
*  The actual record is that Donald Trump oversaw the biggest job loss of a president in American [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1017.24s)]
*  history, along with mass death and abject disaster. Now, you might say that was not all Trump's fault, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1024.44s)]
*  and fair enough, but inflation, the supply chain and eggs and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1031.72s)]
*  spiking gas prices and shipping backlogs, those are not President Biden's fault either. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1037.08s)]
*  But he has gotten to work putting together an economic vision completely opposite of Donald [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1041.48s)]
*  Trump, who cut taxes for corporations and rich people as his signature economic move. As President [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1047.24s)]
*  Biden likes to say, he wants an economy from the middle up, from the bottom up, and it's actually [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1053.48s)]
*  produced tangible benefits. More workers unionized, higher pay, and the best economic performance of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1059.64s)]
*  any president under extremely difficult conditions this nation has seen since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc3I63GkH0&t=1067.88s)]
