# ‘The vibes have changed’: Harris candidacy injects enthusiasm back into the campaign
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg)
*  A lot's changed in the last two weeks, and I want to play you sound from a focused group [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=0.0s)]
*  of swing voters in Wisconsin run by an organization called Engageus. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=3.6s)]
*  It's a group of 12 people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=7.76s)]
*  They all voted for both Trump and Biden in the past. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=8.9s)]
*  So you got nine independents, two Democrats and a Republican. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=11.36s)]
*  And they were asked what they feel when they see the new Democratic nominee Kamala Harris [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=14.16s)]
*  on TV. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=18.8s)]
*  I'm happy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=19.8s)]
*  I'm enthused. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=20.8s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=21.8s)]
*  I want to know more about her. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=22.8s)]
*  I'm mostly proud. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=26.52s)]
*  Confused. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=28.72s)]
*  Nauseated. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=29.72s)]
*  Relieved. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=30.72s)]
*  Relief. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=31.72s)]
*  Indifferent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=32.72s)]
*  Cautiously optimistic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=33.72s)]
*  I 100% agree. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=34.72s)]
*  Cautiously optimistic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=35.72s)]
*  Relief. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=36.72s)]
*  I've liked what she said since, I mean, I've seen her speak a couple of times on the news [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=37.72s)]
*  and on YouTube, and I'm liking it more and more what she's saying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=47.72s)]
*  The vibes appear to be changing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=52.72s)]
*  I think the one is nauseated, probably not going to come over. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=55.2s)]
*  Mallory McMorrow is a Democratic state senator in Michigan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=69.0s)]
*  David Hogg is the president of Leaders We Deserve, an organization dedicated to electing young [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=72.48s)]
*  progressive candidates, and they joined me now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=76.64s)]
*  David, I want to start with you because one of the things that we covered a lot in the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=78.64s)]
*  first part of this campaign when the nominee was Joe Biden, or was likely going to be, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=82.32s)]
*  was that there was a divergence between what you might call the sort of material conditions [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=86.8s)]
*  of the country, which by a lot of metrics and formulas you might use to predict these [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=90.96s)]
*  things seem to show a country that was doing pretty well in many respects, and the polling [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=94.88s)]
*  and the vibes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=99.72s)]
*  And I feel like we've gotten a real-time test of how much was about vibes, and the vibes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=101.0s)]
*  have changed a lot. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=106.83999999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  Look, I think they absolutely have changed for the better. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=109.84s)]
*  I think that young people are fired up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  I think for the first time in many Gen Z voters' lives, they're not just voting against somebody [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=114.4s)]
*  like Donald Trump, they're voting for someone, whether that's somebody like Vice President [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=118.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz, or whether that's somebody like Katrina Shanklin, who [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=123.16s)]
*  I'm currently talking to you right now from a motel in rural Wisconsin, where I'm working [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  on a congressional with a young candidate right now, working to turn out young people [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=132.2s)]
*  around the country by giving them other young people to vote for down the ballot. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=136.72s)]
*  We need to make sure people understand this is not just about the presidential election. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=140.32s)]
*  This is also about making sure that abortion isn't banned in your state. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=144.68s)]
*  This is about making sure that you have stronger gun laws that are passed by your state, because [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=147.28s)]
*  we know so much is going to get blocked by the filibuster in Congress. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=151.08s)]
*  But there is a lot of action that's possible at the state level. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's what we're doing at Leaders We Deserve. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=156.72s)]
*  And for anybody that wants to learn more about that, they can go to leaderswedeserve.com [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=158.24s)]
*  to hear more about our candidates and what we're doing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=163.16s)]
*  Senator McMorrow, from your perspective in Michigan, what have you seen? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=165.88s)]
*  It is night and day from a few weeks ago to now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=171.36s)]
*  And first of all, I just want to start by maybe giving Donald Trump a little bit of credit. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=174.44s)]
*  I watched his press conference yesterday. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=178.76s)]
*  Maybe he confused Montana with Michigan because they are states that both start with the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=181.32s)]
*  letter M. But this is the swing state. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=186.16s)]
*  And I can tell you on the ground, the energy is so infectious. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=188.2s)]
*  We saw 15000 people plus out in Detroit this week. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  There was a Whitney Houston singalong. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=195.52s)]
*  I mean, people were just thrilled for hours on end. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=197.36s)]
*  We've seen record signups. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  We've seen people making homemade merchandise. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=203.24s)]
*  It is like nothing that I've seen since, you know, 2008. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  People are excited and optimistic and they want to be a part of choosing joy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't think you can underestimate how powerful it is to move past grievance and anger [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=215.52s)]
*  and hate and finally be proud of this country again and what we can accomplish when we work [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=221.28s)]
*  together. And that is the vision that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are presenting us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And to the extent that we have, you know, empirical means of measuring this right, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=231.08s)]
*  small dollar donors, attendance at rallies, volunteer signups, like they're all I don't [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=235.84s)]
*  we wouldn't be doing this segment if none of if this was just some feeling like you're [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=241.28s)]
*  watching 15 to 20000 people at an arena in Glendale, Arizona right now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=245.12s)]
*  You know, shaking their signs and and going crazy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=251.4s)]
*  I also do think there's something there's politics can be cruel in some ways or ironic, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=254.56s)]
*  David. And this stuck out to me that Joe Biden, again, to sort of come back to the man's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=261.24s)]
*  record as president, particularly in domestic policy versus his polling, since he dropped [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=266.6s)]
*  out, his approval rating has gone up five points. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=271.88s)]
*  So like nothing has changed in the way he's presidenting and nothing has changed really [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  objectively and like the material conditions, the country mortgage rates come down a little [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=280.24s)]
*  bit. But to me, that single number just speaks to the fact that like there was an issue [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=283.8s)]
*  with him, his candidacy specifically that that even his own political standing has [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=290.08s)]
*  increased subsequently. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=296.2s)]
*  Yeah, it has. And I think it shows that, you know, people are very approving of a statesman. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=298.64s)]
*  And that's what Joe Biden has been a public servant his entire life. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's important to note, too, he's part of the inspiration for why I created [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=306.6s)]
*  leaders we deserve with Maxwell Frost's campaign manager, Kevin Lada, because I know this is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  hard for some viewers to believe. But President Biden was twenty nine when he was first [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=314.72s)]
*  elected. And, you know, if we look at some of the most successful presidents we've ever [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=318.56s)]
*  had, whether that's FDR or whether that's LBJ, they were both twenty eight years old when [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=322.68s)]
*  they were first elected to Congress and their state legislature. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=328.4s)]
*  And it makes sense, right? If you start when you're young, you get a ton of experience. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=331.52s)]
*  And I think what voters are doing in those approval polls is they're seeing Joe Biden [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=334.48s)]
*  for who he is, which is a good man that ultimately we knew was going to make the right [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=338.56s)]
*  decision because he's always going to put the country before himself. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=342.44s)]
*  And that's exactly what he did. And that's why voters are so fired up now to see, you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=345.6s)]
*  know, Vice President Harris out there getting the full attention of the media for the first [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=349.56s)]
*  time in, you know, three years because vice presidents are often left out of it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=353.48s)]
*  And now we're also seeing, you know, Governor Walz out there that many people had only [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=357.24s)]
*  heard of in the political scene, but now are super fired up about. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=362.16s)]
*  And young people are more ecstatic, frankly, than I have ever seen them before, because [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  this time they're not just voting against Donald Trump. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=368.92s)]
*  They're truly voting for somebody voting for someone that they believe in. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=371.44s)]
*  And that is so, so powerful. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=375.72s)]
*  And I know people they just want, like was said earlier, they want joy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=377.44000000000005s)]
*  We're so tired of the dark moment our country has been in. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=381.8s)]
*  And these young people are part of that. So if anybody wants to help, they can go to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  leaderswedeserve.com. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  Senator, how linked are the fates of folks in, say, the Michigan state legislature like [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=388.68s)]
*  yourself, both the House and the Senate, which Democrats have majorities in after being [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=393.88s)]
*  shut out of that for a long time? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=397.68s)]
*  There's a backstory there to the prospects at the top of the ticket to the sort of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=398.96s)]
*  marquee statewide races. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=403.68s)]
*  You know, I think we've always said all politics is local. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=406.88s)]
*  But if we've learned anything over the past few cycles, it's that all politics is also [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=409.76s)]
*  national. Yes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=413.48s)]
*  And as hard as our candidates work, we can't break out of what is happening on the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=414.56s)]
*  national level. So the amount of energy, the amount of donations, first time donations. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  I got a text from my kindergarten teacher who had never donated to a candidate in her [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=424.24s)]
*  life. If we can channel that energy and bring it down to all of our state House [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=428.2s)]
*  candidates who are up to hold our Democratic majority, we all win and we maintain a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  strong foundation that ensures that Kamala Harris not only becomes president, but [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  succeeds once she's in office. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=442.68s)]
*  David Hogg and Mallory McMorrow, thank you both. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=444.96s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY4TVklzhUg&t=447.16s)]
