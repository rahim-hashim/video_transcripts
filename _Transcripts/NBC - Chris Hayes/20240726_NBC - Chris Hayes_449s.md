Video Description: UAW president Shawn Fain: "I truly find it pathetic when I hear Trump—a scab—talk about how he's going to bring back the auto industry and bring it back fast. When he was president, he didn't do a damn thing to help the auto industry. Plants were closing and left this country, and he did nothing to help it.”

# UAW chief rips Trump as 'scab' who 'didn't do a damn thing' for auto industry
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ)
*  Joe Biden's been the most pro-labor president in memory, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and he was the first sitting president to join a picket line [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=3.24s)]
*  when he marched in solidarity with the United Auto Workers [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=5.68s)]
*  during their strike last fall, which is one reason why the UAW [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=8.72s)]
*  endorsed Biden for president back in January of this year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=12.02s)]
*  The union has not yet endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=15.44s)]
*  for the same job. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=19.0s)]
*  So what inroads does she need to make with organized labor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=19.96s)]
*  ahead of November's election? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=23.96s)]
*  Joining me now is someone well-suited [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=25.12s)]
*  to answer that question. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=26.44s)]
*  Sean Fain is the president of the United Auto Workers Union. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=27.28s)]
*  Sean, it's good to see you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=30.48s)]
*  We can do this the easy way or the long way. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=32.24s)]
*  If you want to do it the easy way, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=33.68s)]
*  you can tell me if you're going to endorse Kamala Harris, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  then we can talk about Olympics for five minutes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=37.32s)]
*  That sounds like a plan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=40.2s)]
*  Hey, thanks, Ali. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=41.28s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=42.04s)]
*  Hey, look, as I said earlier, we have a process we follow [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=42.88s)]
*  when we do this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=47.84s)]
*  And our membership drives this union now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=48.56s)]
*  It's not a top-down organization. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=50.8s)]
*  So we've been having discussions with our executive committee. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=52.32s)]
*  I was able to talk to Vice President Harris on Wednesday. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  We tried hooking up the last few days throughout the week [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=59.08s)]
*  and just couldn't make it work. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=62.12s)]
*  And so we were able to talk, had a really good conversation [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=63.44s)]
*  as we always have. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=65.84s)]
*  And I told her, you know, expectations we have, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  things we'd like to see. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  But our board, we are reaching out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=71.36s)]
*  to leaders all over the nation and our regions and stuff [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=73.24s)]
*  and getting feedback from them what they want to see, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=76.32s)]
*  as we always do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=78.84s)]
*  And then when we make an endorsement, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=79.88s)]
*  we'll make that announcement on our time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=83.56s)]
*  And then we'll have a meeting with nobody else. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=85.28s)]
*  So that's how we do things in UAW. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=87.08s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=88.96s)]
*  It's interesting because a lot of people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  don't know about the evolution of unions like yours, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=91.32s)]
*  where you say it's not top-down. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  It's consultative. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=94.64s)]
*  And you talk about expectations and what you'd like to see. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=96.52s)]
*  Can you tell me what some of those things are, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  some of the things you'd like a presidential candidate [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=100.88s)]
*  to commit to in exchange for your support? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=103.16s)]
*  Look, this election is about one thing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=106.16s)]
*  It's about taking our lives back. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=109.16s)]
*  It's about a working class that's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=110.72s)]
*  been left behind for decades due to corporate greed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  at the top. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=114.76s)]
*  And so we have what we call our four core issues. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  And those are a living wage. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=119.28s)]
*  And that doesn't mean a bare minimum. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  That means a living wage where when [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=123.68s)]
*  someone goes to work, no matter what work they do, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  they can live a decent life. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  Adequate health care for everybody. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  There's no excuse in the richest nation in the world [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=131.12s)]
*  that we don't have health care for everyone. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  It should be a right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=135.0s)]
*  Retirement security. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=136.52s)]
*  Retirement security is a must. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  60% of the people in this nation have no retirement savings, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=139.52s)]
*  not because they're not responsible, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=143.12s)]
*  but because they don't make enough money to save anything. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=144.92s)]
*  And then the final thing is taking our time back, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  taking our lives back. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, many workers in the working class [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=151.04s)]
*  work seven days a week, 12 hours a day, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  or two and three jobs just to scrape to get by. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=155.48s)]
*  And that's not a life. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=157.48s)]
*  So working class people are fed up [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  with basically working their asses off [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  and generating all these massive profits for these companies [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=163.2s)]
*  and then being left behind. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=166.0s)]
*  That doesn't work for us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=167.0s)]
*  So those to me are the core four things [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=167.88s)]
*  that gotta happen in this country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  That's why 75% of Americans supported us in that fight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=171.88s)]
*  That was quite a strike that you guys had [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  and met with great success in that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=179.16s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly, one of the people [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=181.24s)]
*  who is being thought about as a vice presidential candidate, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  he's on the short list to join the Harris ticket, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=185.44s)]
*  just endorsed the PRO Act, something he hadn't done. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=187.2s)]
*  It's a massive piece of labor rights legislation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=189.84s)]
*  Do you take that as a sign that union rights [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=192.84s)]
*  are going to be a red line for the Kamala Harris campaign? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=195.56s)]
*  Oh, look, they should be. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=200.48s)]
*  Anyone that didn't support the PRO Act [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  does not support working class people, in my opinion. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=204.56s)]
*  And that's gotta happen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=206.88s)]
*  That's a must for us. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=208.56s)]
*  But look, there's a lot bigger issues in this also. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is about taking on a billionaire class [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  and a corporate class. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=214.32s)]
*  And you look, inflation's a big topic in this election. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=215.76s)]
*  And I wanna make one thing clear. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  The inflation wasn't driven by policy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  The inflation we've suffered, the working class has suffered [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=223.88s)]
*  these last several years, was driven by corporate greed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=226.16s)]
*  and consumer price gouging. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=230.24s)]
*  They took advantage, the billionaire class [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=231.56s)]
*  and corporate class did what they do best [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  when there's an emergency or a tragedy in this nation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  They go to work to see how they can extract more wealth [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=241.4s)]
*  for themselves and leave workers further and further behind. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=244.0s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=246.44000000000003s)]
*  And so we need stronger regulations on business. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=247.28000000000003s)]
*  We need stronger union rights for workers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=251.4s)]
*  60 million Americans say they would join a union tomorrow [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=253.52s)]
*  if they had the opportunity. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=256.16s)]
*  And so we're in a situation where we're organizing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  Alabama, Tennessee. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=260.36s)]
*  It was two to one in favor of the UAW, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  but why doesn't that translate into automatic wins? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Because the companies break the laws, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=267.36s)]
*  they willingly break the law, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=269.08s)]
*  because there are very little consequences [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=270.56s)]
*  in the act of doing that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=272.32s)]
*  And so those are issues. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=273.44s)]
*  You look at trade and border security. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=275.44s)]
*  You know, this border crisis, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=277.64s)]
*  I call it a manufactured border crisis by the billionaire class, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=280.44s)]
*  this is what they do best. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=284.64s)]
*  They've been left behind for decades and they use race. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=286.32s)]
*  They use, you know, they'll attack, you know, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=289.11999999999995s)]
*  who somebody loves or now they're using the border crisis, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  which to me is what I call a humanitarian crisis. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  These people aren't what Donald Trump calls rapists [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  and murderers and invaders. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  They're not invading our nation. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  These are destitute and desperate people [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  trying to find a better life, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=306.55999999999995s)]
*  because just like the rest of the working class, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=307.96s)]
*  they've been left behind. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=309.84s)]
*  So that's what this is all about. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  And that's what we got to change. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=312.67999999999995s)]
*  And I truly find it pathetic. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  You know, when I hear Trump the scab, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  talk about how he's gonna bring back the auto industry [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=317.68s)]
*  and bring it back fast. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  When he was president, he didn't do a damn thing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=321.88s)]
*  to help the auto industry. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=324.0s)]
*  Plans were closing and left this country [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=325.2s)]
*  and he did nothing to help it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=327.44s)]
*  So I fully understand that you have to have a process, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=329.64s)]
*  but it does sound like there's not a lot of space [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=332.2s)]
*  between you and your goals, those four corners, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=335.16s)]
*  and what Kamala Harris wants to do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=339.0s)]
*  So I'm guessing you're not gonna be able to do it tonight, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=341.48s)]
*  but is it fair to guess that there's probably [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=344.16s)]
*  an endorsement of Kamala Harris coming, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=346.8s)]
*  or you don't wanna get ahead of that? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't wanna get ahead of our membership. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=350.48s)]
*  I mean, this is about our membership. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=351.8s)]
*  You know, that's who we represent [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=353.12s)]
*  and that's who we speak for. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=354.4s)]
*  And like I said, we'll do it on our time [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=355.4s)]
*  and we'll let everyone know when that is. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=357.36s)]
*  I wanna ask you about one thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=361.48s)]
*  The UAW signed onto a letter [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=362.92s)]
*  with six other unions last week calling on President Biden [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=364.68s)]
*  to end military aid to Israel [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  in order to achieve a ceasefire. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=369.52s)]
*  The letter says, quote, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=371.6s)]
*  Mr. President, the time to act decisively [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=373.0s)]
*  to end the war is now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  Stopping US military aid to Israel [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  is the quickest and most sure way to do so. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=377.68s)]
*  It is what US law demands and it will show your commitment [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  to securing a lasting peace in the region, end quote. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=382.6s)]
*  Have you heard anything from the White House on this issue? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  And are you gonna present that issue [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  to Vice President Harris as well? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=390.04s)]
*  Yes, we've spoken. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=393.36s)]
*  We've actually been in communication with the White House [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=394.44s)]
*  throughout the year about our position on this. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=396.36s)]
*  We called for a ceasefire back in December, early December. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  And look, the UAW has always had a history [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=400.88s)]
*  of standing up for humanity and standing for peace. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=404.4s)]
*  And we're calling for that and we'll continue to do that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  Sean, it's good to see you as always. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=412.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=414.28s)]
*  I'm on TV a lot in the next couple of weeks. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=415.32s)]
*  So when you come to a decision, let me know [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=417.32s)]
*  and I'll make sure to get you on [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  and we can have that discussion about who the UAW [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=421.28s)]
*  and its membership will be supporting. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=423.44s)]
*  But good to see you as always. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=424.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=425.55999999999995s)]
*  Sounds good. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  We look forward to it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=427.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyN-HMqNOqQ&t=430.84s)]
