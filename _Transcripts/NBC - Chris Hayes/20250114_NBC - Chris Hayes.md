# ‘Elon knows what he’s doing’ Gavin Newsom slams Musk for fueling wildfires lies
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc)
*  The deadly California wildfires continue to burn across the Los Angeles area with no end [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=0.0s)]
*  in sight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=4.92s)]
*  The state is already working on a plan to rebuild. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=5.92s)]
*  Tonight, MSNBC's Jen Psaki was in Altadena, California, where she spoke to Governor Gavin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=8.36s)]
*  Newsom. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=13.08s)]
*  They discussed the process of rebuilding, the attacks and misinformation coming from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=14.08s)]
*  President-elect Trump, and threats by Republican lawmakers in Congress to put conditions on [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=17.8s)]
*  emergency aid. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=23.16s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested additional aid might have to come from with certain conditions [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=25.72s)]
*  Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said he expects funding to have strings attached. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=29.88s)]
*  Senator Tuberville even said California doesn't deserve anything, saying, quote, unless they [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=34.08s)]
*  show us they are going to make some changes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=38.64s)]
*  You have been here on the ground in communities for the last week. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=41.56s)]
*  What is your reaction to the response from leaders in Washington? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=46.32s)]
*  Well, if that's leadership, I have a different definition. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=49.4s)]
*  I imagine it would be universally felt here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  It's I'm not meeting Democrats. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=56.32s)]
*  I'm not meeting Republicans. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm not meeting Californians. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I mean, American citizens desperate in need. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=61.48s)]
*  And what they need is empathy, care, compassion, understanding. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=64.52s)]
*  They need support, not rhetoric, not strings attached. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=68.56s)]
*  I mean, I met families who lost not only their home, but their business and their church, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=72.24s)]
*  their sense of self place community. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=81.08s)]
*  They had a zoom the other night and everyone broke down crying because all they wanted [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=84.92s)]
*  to do is see the faces of one another. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=88.4s)]
*  And yet that's the face of leadership in the state, the United States of America, conditioning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=91.04s)]
*  aid to the American people in need, politicizing this tragic moment. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=95.2s)]
*  So I'll spare any more commentary on it, just to say I would encourage these people, their [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=102.0s)]
*  human beings, their parents. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=107.72s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=110.04s)]
*  Come out here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=111.28s)]
*  Visit. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=112.28s)]
*  Visit with these folks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=113.28s)]
*  And let's have a conversation after that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=114.28s)]
*  I'm more interested from you and how damaging it is when you have somebody with that type [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  of a platform who is next week going to be the president of the United States is injecting [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=123.44s)]
*  inaccurate information about a the worst wildfires in American history. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=128.02s)]
*  Let me answer that by thanking president of the United States, Joe Biden, who within 36 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=132.36s)]
*  hours supported a major disaster declaration by text. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=140.44s)]
*  Within a few minutes later, committed 100. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=147.76s)]
*  He could have just committed 75 percent 90. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=150.24s)]
*  He said 100 percent of all the costs for disaster recovery that took the time to meet with first [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=152.8s)]
*  responders was here on the ground. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=158.92s)]
*  I want to thank President Joe Biden. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=161.92s)]
*  And then I want to offer that as an example to the incoming president of presidential [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  leadership, a president of the United States of America, being here for the American citizen. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  He didn't ask me, is this a conservative part of California? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=176.68s)]
*  Altadena, did they vote for me? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=180.04s)]
*  He didn't ask for his staff to look at the last election and see how many were for Kamala [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  or how many were for Donald Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=188.0s)]
*  He said, pal, you got it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=190.32s)]
*  We have their backs. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=192.64s)]
*  Express empathy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=194.32s)]
*  I have firefighters that went up to him. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=195.4s)]
*  They had tears in his eyes after meeting Joe Biden, who was consoling them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that's an example for the incoming president. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=202.84s)]
*  What's not, I think, helpful or beneficial is a string of consciousness. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=206.48s)]
*  These wild eyed fantasies that somehow the state water project, we have reservoirs that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=212.64s)]
*  are at or near historic highs, full, completely full, that somehow there's a magical spigot [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=219.28s)]
*  in California, in northern California, that just can be turned on and all of a sudden [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=225.0s)]
*  there will be rain or water flowing everywhere. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=228.88s)]
*  It's not helpful. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  It's damaging to the very foundation of the notion of what are facts, what are truths. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=235.4s)]
*  And the fact of that asymmetry, that's profound and consequential, amplified by people like [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=241.44s)]
*  what's being candid, Elon Musk and others. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=247.8s)]
*  And that one-two punch is real. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=250.44s)]
*  And it's not just about this fire. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=252.56s)]
*  And as for hereditary force winds, a miss and disinformation that can divide a country [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  on a myriad of issues, this is serious. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=260.56s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=264.04s)]
*  They want to take us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=265.04s)]
*  I get it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=266.04s)]
*  I'm not naive. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=267.04s)]
*  I get the California Derangement Syndrome. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=268.04s)]
*  I've been living on that for years and years. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=269.04s)]
*  New scum. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=270.48s)]
*  You know, I'm the same seventh grade. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=271.48s)]
*  I remember the guy on Baltimore Avenue that called me new scum. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=273.56s)]
*  I was in seventh grade. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  I can handle that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=279.16s)]
*  We'll leave that aside. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=281.8s)]
*  I understand what they're trying to do. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=284.0s)]
*  I want to work with them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  It's not about me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  It's about people that we both represent. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  He represents and I represent. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=292.24s)]
*  And I'm honored and proud to represent these folks. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=294.56s)]
*  And I desperately plead with them, come out here, help us, and we will help you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  You'll be elevated, Mr. President. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  At the end of the day, you'll be the one we all will go to and say thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=304.86s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=309.6s)]
*  Thank you for living up to the values of this country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=311.04s)]
*  Thank you for having the backs of these families and these kids. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  I met a kid the other day, literally was driving away. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=316.36s)]
*  Their house was on fire in the Palisades. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=320.48s)]
*  And the young daughter said, daddy, did you get my bunny? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=323.12s)]
*  And he said, I didn't get your bunny. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=325.92s)]
*  I got four kids. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  That's what I hope that the President of the United States, President Trump, has an opportunity [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=330.16s)]
*  to meet with that family. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=334.88s)]
*  I'm Jen Psaki, host of Inside with Jen Psaki here on MSNBC. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=338.08s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=341.2s)]
*  Jen, great interview today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=342.4s)]
*  Hi, Chris. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=343.96s)]
*  Let's talk first about just your sense of right now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=345.32s)]
*  So there's sort of two stages, right? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=349.2s)]
*  Like they got to get the fires under control. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  And it is very difficult, if not impossible, with the winds going at their are. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=353.0s)]
*  What your understanding from the interview is about how feasible that is and if there's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  a timeframe they can even put on it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, we talked about that a little bit in the interview too, Chris. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=362.84s)]
*  As you mentioned earlier, there is an expectation of increased winds overnight. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=367.12s)]
*  We talked about the preparations they're putting in place for that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=372.12s)]
*  He has what he needs in preparation for that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=374.88s)]
*  But there are two stages right now. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=377.76s)]
*  There is dealing with the weather and Mother Nature. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=379.68s)]
*  And then there is also planning for the recovery and the rebuilding, which is happening at [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=383.32s)]
*  the same time. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=387.44s)]
*  There's 100,000 people who have lost their homes, people who have lost their schools, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=388.44s)]
*  lost their churches, lost their communities. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=392.04s)]
*  There's also predatory behavior that's happening out there that he's learned from people in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=395.52s)]
*  the community as well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=400.64s)]
*  So these are all of the things he's navigating. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=401.92s)]
*  We talked about all of them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=404.6s)]
*  It is also happening at the same time where you're dealing with the worst wildfires in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=405.6s)]
*  American history and he's dealing with the worst disinformation space happening at the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=411.5s)]
*  same time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=416.96s)]
*  And Republicans in Washington who want to condition aid and push this disinformation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=418.24s)]
*  So these are all the challenges that he is facing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  I've interviewed him a number of times. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  I know you have too. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=428.18s)]
*  I've never seen him as emotional and as distressed as he is in this moment for good reason, for [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=429.66s)]
*  understandable reason. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=434.3s)]
*  But it is whack-a-mole in trying to get information out to the people in the state, the people [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  who are impacted by these fires, because of forces like the incoming president and his [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  best friend, Elon Musk, who are working on the other side. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=447.62s)]
*  The thing I've talked to a bunch of people in California, of course, we all have, everyone [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=452.24s)]
*  I think is one degree at most removed from this in many respects. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=456.92s)]
*  So many people's lives have been touched. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=460.5s)]
*  You know, aside from the profound loss at the deep emotional level of losing your home, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=463.08s)]
*  there's also then just the sheer hassle that you are staring down. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=468.52s)]
*  And this is a state that has underproduced housing for a long time where housing supply [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=474.34000000000003s)]
*  has been constrained. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  You've got stories of Zillow prices being jacked through the roof. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=479.4s)]
*  You've now got, you know, 1600 households that are all now looking to rent at the same [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  Like any sense of how you essentially deal with that from a governmental perspective? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=489.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, they're going to need tens of billions of dollars is what he said. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  They don't have an exact number. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=501.7s)]
*  There's been a lot of numbers thrown out there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  President Biden said tens of billions. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=504.96s)]
*  Some have suggested 50 billion. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=507.0s)]
*  They don't know exactly yet, right? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=508.88s)]
*  Because they're doing a survey of the damage without knowing the full extent of the damage. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=510.82s)]
*  And then there's this question of home insurance, which as you know, has been a long challenging [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=515.5s)]
*  issue in the state of California. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=520.2s)]
*  Insurers, major insurers pulled out of insuring homes in California. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=522.52s)]
*  They have a program in California. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=526.28s)]
*  But is that going to have enough funding to cover the cost of what everybody needs? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=529.6s)]
*  And how long is that going to take? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=533.7s)]
*  And it's going to take months and months and months even to clear the debris and clear [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=534.98s)]
*  the damage. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=538.7s)]
*  The other tough question I know you've talked about, Chris, and I talked with the governor [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=539.74s)]
*  about is, are there tough conversations that need to happen about where you can rebuild? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=543.02s)]
*  Which is difficult. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=550.02s)]
*  Some of these communities have tremendous, Altadena is one of them, histories, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=551.02s)]
*  And is there going to be, need to be, in addition to the funding, a response from the federal [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=555.66s)]
*  That is like in the years after Katrina, which we talked about as well, which is rebuilding [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=560.92s)]
*  the infrastructure and the waterways and making sure that it's safe to build upon. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=566.52s)]
*  So those are all of the challenges. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=571.24s)]
*  And that's the stage after containment, after these fires are stopped. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=574.06s)]
*  Those are all things that he and the government are certainly contemplating at this point [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=578.06s)]
*  in time. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=582.4s)]
*  Did you get a sense quickly, just in the last minute here, of how much, just how much the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=583.4s)]
*  sort of national conversation matters there, or is it just such a different situation on [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=587.52s)]
*  the ground that like the nonsense on cable news doesn't penetrate? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=594.04s)]
*  I mean, by nonsense, do you mean the suggestion that age should be conditioned and that they [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=599.32s)]
*  don't deserve assistance, that kind of nonsense, that kind of stuff? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=604.04s)]
*  I think what we talked about a bit also was the role of somebody like Elon Musk, who had [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=608.08s)]
*  to, firefighters had to explain to him what the facts on the ground are. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=613.08s)]
*  That's what they're dealing with. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=617.24s)]
*  So it doesn't feel good. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=618.44s)]
*  And we talked about this, too, when you've lost your home, you've lost your school, you've [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  lost your church, your place of worship, and you are dealing with absurd political debates [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=624.5200000000001s)]
*  when that has never historically been the case. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, Louisiana is a place where, and he talked about this, he was proud to support [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=635.76s)]
*  funding after Hurricane Katrina. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=641.32s)]
*  Mike Johnson is a person who's saying age should be conditioned. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=643.6s)]
*  And I think that's what we talked about. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_iUpoTSyc&t=647.2s)]
