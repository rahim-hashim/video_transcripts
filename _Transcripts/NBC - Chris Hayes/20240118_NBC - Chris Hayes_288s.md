Video Description: According to the executives attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, a second Trump term is no cause for concern. One "prominent U.S. business executive” told CNBC a Trump victory "won't be the end of the world.” “The global financial elites of Davos will be just fine—because the Trump tax cuts were great for them,” says Chris Hayes.

# ‘Trump tax cuts were great for them’: U.S. execs unconcerned about Trump victory
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0)
*  There's been a lot of really good reporting on the possible agenda of a second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=0.0s)]
*  Largely, it's terrifying. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=4.68s)]
*  It's a vision of retribution-based government, a presidential dictatorship that crushes dissent, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=6.2s)]
*  triggers mass deportations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=11.72s)]
*  But for all those radical plans to essentially subvert American democracy, there is a central [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  aspect of Trumpism that's very old-school Republicanism, and that is helping out the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=19.04s)]
*  richest Americans and the biggest corporations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=23.88s)]
*  Now, you don't hear it from Trump on the campaign trail, and he heaps on the populist authoritarian [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  red meat to adoring crowds of, quote, everyday people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=30.96s)]
*  But as Jeff Stein of the Washington Post reported this month, behind closed doors, Trump is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=33.96s)]
*  telling people close to them he would like to push through a big second round of tax [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  cuts for the biggest corporations. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=43.0s)]
*  If you were paying attention, this has been a dynamic of Trumpism all the way back to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=46.2s)]
*  2016. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  All of Trump's America First populism had him railing against the establishment donor [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  class and taking it back to the country for the little guy and doing it with really dark [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=55.56s)]
*  overtones. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=66.92s)]
*  they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  So that's what he said to voters. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  And then a week after he won that election, he went to the 21 Club restaurant in Midtown, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=79.68s)]
*  a former speakeasy frequented by the rich and the powerful, and he told the plutocrats [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=85.08s)]
*  there something completely different. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=89.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=91.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=92.36s)]
*  Have your surpresident elected. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=93.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=94.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=95.36s)]
*  We'll get your taxes down. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=96.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=97.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=98.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=99.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=100.36s)]
*  Thank you, America. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=101.36s)]
*  Thank you, America. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=102.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=103.36s)]
*  Thank you, America. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=104.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=105.36s)]
*  Yeah, they loved him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=106.36s)]
*  We'll get your taxes down. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=107.36s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=108.96s)]
*  That was one of the rare promises that Donald Trump absolutely kept. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=110.44s)]
*  In 2017, he signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill largely for the rich and corporations. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=114.2s)]
*  It was hands down the largest, the least popular piece of legislation he ever signed and his [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=119.8s)]
*  most important, a plan that gave lots of breaks to the rich, to corporations and didn't stimulate [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=125.74s)]
*  the economy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=130.8s)]
*  It also, and people forget this, it gave Trump his lowest approval rating until the Capitol [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=131.8s)]
*  insurrection. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=136.6s)]
*  Trump is now thinking about doing it again because fundamentally that is whose interest [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=138.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is looking to serve, even as he accuses his challengers of being captured [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=142.52s)]
*  by rich special interests. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=147.72s)]
*  Nikki Haley has been in the pocket of the open borders establishment owners her entire [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=150.36s)]
*  career and she's a globalist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=154.72s)]
*  She likes the globe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=157.72s)]
*  I like America first. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  She likes the globe. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=161.96s)]
*  What makes that rhetoric especially rich is that at this very moment, the globalists, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=163.8s)]
*  the global financial elites are gathering together in the stately Alpine ski resort [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=167.68s)]
*  town of Davos, Switzerland for the annual World Economic Forum convention. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=171.26s)]
*  So is the donor class fearful of what another Trump term portends for them? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=176.1s)]
*  Nope. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=180.38s)]
*  Not according to multiple US executives in Davos who spoke with CNBC this week. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  One prominent US business executive who asked not to be named said a Trump victory won't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  be the end of the world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  Another US bank CEO privately told CNBC that Trump is quote, all bark and no bite. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=191.54s)]
*  The bank chief then added quote, he's going to win the presidency. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=196.0s)]
*  Many of his policies were right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=199.34s)]
*  The point that Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan had no trouble making on the record. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=201.06s)]
*  He's kind of right about NATO. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=206.5s)]
*  Kind of right about immigration. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=208.62s)]
*  He grew the economy quite well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  China virus. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=212.06s)]
*  Tax reform worked. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=213.22s)]
*  He was right about some of China. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=214.54s)]
*  As a CEO of a multinational global business, what you think would be better for the business? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=215.9s)]
*  I have to be prepared for both. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  I will be prepared for both. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=224.38s)]
*  We will deal with both. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=226.1s)]
*  My company will survive and thrive in both. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=227.82s)]
*  I love Jamie Dian saying tax reform worked. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=231.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=233.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=234.82s)]
*  JP Morgan got an enormous tax cut like every other corporation it worked. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=235.82s)]
*  The global financial elites of Davos will be just fine because the Trump tax cuts were [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=241.34s)]
*  great for them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=246.34s)]
*  As everyday Americans consider how our reinvigorated, revenge-seeking President Trump will stick [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=247.82s)]
*  it to the left and to immigrants, to gay and trans folks, to women seeking bodily autonomy, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=252.74s)]
*  is absolutely clear to me that while a second Trump term threatens American democracy and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=257.5s)]
*  threatens a lot of Americans, it sure does not threaten America's Davos set. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwIyMkctn0&t=261.86s)]
