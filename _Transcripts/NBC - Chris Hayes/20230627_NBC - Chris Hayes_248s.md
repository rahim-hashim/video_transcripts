# Trump offers 12-point rebuttal of bombshell classified documents tape
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ)
*  Donald Trump is now in full spin mode after he's been caught on tape in the classified [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  documents case. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=5.8s)]
*  As cited in Jack's mis-indicement of the ex-president, the audio is from a 2021 conversation Trump [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=7.16s)]
*  had with a couple of people working on a book about Mark Meadows. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=12.52s)]
*  And it's pretty clear Trump has classified documents right there in the room, and he's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=15.68s)]
*  showing them off. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=20.36s)]
*  NBC News has obtained the tape, and we're going to play it for you in full. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=21.36s)]
*  And then we'll play you Trump's attempt to explain this one away. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=25.16s)]
*  Very good. Stick around for that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=29.24s)]
*  So first, here's Trump caught on tape in 2021. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=30.8s)]
*  These are bad, sick people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=34.96s)]
*  That was your coup, you know, against you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=37.68s)]
*  Well, it started right at the beginning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=41.12s)]
*  When Milley's talking about, oh, you were going to try to do a coup. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=42.44s)]
*  They were trying to do that before you even were sworn in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=45.72s)]
*  That's right. Trying to overthrow your election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=48.68s)]
*  Well, with Milley, let me see that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=50.68s)]
*  I'll show you an example. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=53.08s)]
*  He said that I wanted to attack Iran. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=54.64s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=60.96s)]
*  This thing just came up. Look. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=63.04s)]
*  This was him. They presented me this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=66.28s)]
*  This is off the record, but they presented me this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=69.16s)]
*  This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=72.48s)]
*  We looked at him. This was him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=77.08s)]
*  This wasn't done by me. This was him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=78.56s)]
*  All sorts of stuff. Pages long. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=80.8s)]
*  Wait a minute. Let's see here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=85.04s)]
*  I just found, isn't that amazing? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=90.84s)]
*  This totally wins my case, you know, except it is like highly confidential. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=93.16s)]
*  Secret. This is secret information. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=98.12s)]
*  Look at this. You attack and Hillary would print that out all the time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=101.48s)]
*  She said, you know, she'd send it to Anthony Weiner. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=107.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=111.08s)]
*  For Perlmer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=111.6s)]
*  He's print. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=113.24s)]
*  By the way, isn't that incredible? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  I was just saying, because we were talking about it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=116.24s)]
*  And he said he wanted to attack Iran and what? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  He said the papers. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=122.6s)]
*  This was done by the military given to me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  I think we can probably, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=128.92s)]
*  We'll have to see. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we'll have to try to figure out a... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=133.12s)]
*  See, as president, I could have de-classified. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=136.4s)]
*  No, I can't, you know, but this is... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=138.52s)]
*  Yeah, now we have a problem. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=140.24s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=141.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=142.72s)]
*  It's so cool. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=143.24s)]
*  I mean, it's so... [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=144.24s)]
*  I'm... Look, we heard Ivan... [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  And you probably almost didn't believe me, but now you believe me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=147.28s)]
*  No, I believe you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  It's incredible, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  No, it's never been that important. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=152.24s)]
*  Bring some cokes in, please. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  This is secret information. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=156.4s)]
*  Look, look at this, unquote. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  OK, so that's pretty damning. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  And it sure seems to debunk Trump's previous excuse. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=160.88s)]
*  He magically classified all the documents he stole, possibly without telling anyone. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=163.4s)]
*  Trump says he has the document. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=168.16s)]
*  You can hear him rifling through his beautiful mind piles of papers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=169.44s)]
*  And he admits he did not de-classify the documents while president. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=173.16s)]
*  You'd think this would be a pretty open and shut case at this point, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  but today, the indicted ex-president offered a 12-point refutation of the recording. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=179.8s)]
*  Everything was fine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=186.24s)]
*  We did nothing wrong, and everybody knows it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=187.4s)]
*  You're not concerned then with your own voice on those recordings? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  My voice was fine. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=193.28s)]
*  What did I say wrong in those recordings? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=194.84s)]
*  I didn't even see the recording. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=196.6s)]
*  All I know is I did nothing wrong. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  We had a lot of papers, a lot of papers stacked up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=200.6s)]
*  In fact, you could hear the rustle of the paper. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=203.72s)]
*  And nobody said I did anything wrong other than the fake news, which, of course, is Fox, too. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  Are there any other recordings that we should be concerned of? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=212.84s)]
*  I don't know of any recordings that you should be concerned with, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=216.32s)]
*  because I don't do things wrong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=219.88s)]
*  I do things right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=221.84s)]
*  I'm a legitimate person. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=223.12s)]
*  Save it for the judge, buddy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGhpv5NhIOQ&t=224.44s)]
