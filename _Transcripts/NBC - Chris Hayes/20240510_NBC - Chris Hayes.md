# ‘Dumpster fire’ Kristi Noem cuts book tour short after disastrous week
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc)
*  You know the old saying, if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=0.0s)]
*  Kristi Noem doesn't. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=4.2s)]
*  You may have heard that the Republican South Dakota governor's new book boasts about the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=6.12s)]
*  time she shot and killed Cricket, a 14-month-old wire-haired pointer that crossed her. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=10.0s)]
*  But have you heard the audiobook? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=16.28s)]
*  When I got back into my truck, Cricket was sitting in the passenger seat, looking like [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=20.04s)]
*  she had just won the lottery, the picture of pure joy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=23.84s)]
*  I hated that dog. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=28.24s)]
*  As I drove home, I realized that I had no choice. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=30.72s)]
*  Cricket was untrainable, and after trying to bite me, dangerous to anybody that she [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=34.04s)]
*  came in contact with. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=38.68s)]
*  A dog who bites is dangerous and unpredictable. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=40.22s)]
*  Are you listening, Joe Biden? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  I stopped the truck in the middle of the yard, I got out my gun, grabbed Cricket's leash, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=45.16s)]
*  and I let her out into the pasture and down into the gravel pit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=50.36s)]
*  It was not a pleasant job, but it had to be done. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=54.26s)]
*  You may already know that story and also how moments later she came across a family goat [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=58.54s)]
*  and ended its life in that same gravel pit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=62.459999999999994s)]
*  But what you probably didn't know was that there were witnesses to the Kristi Noem spree [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=65.3s)]
*  killings. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=69.38s)]
*  And they were pretty creeped out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=70.88s)]
*  My uncle, who was the general contractor building our house, called me and he said, what got [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=73.46s)]
*  into you today? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=78.9s)]
*  Nothing, I responded. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=80.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=82.9s)]
*  He said, well, the guy said you came barreling into the yard with your truck, you slammed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=83.9s)]
*  the door, took a gun and a dog over the hill out of sight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  They heard one shot, you came back without the dog. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  Then you grabbed the goat and headed back up over the hill, then they heard another [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=93.54s)]
*  shot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  You came back, slammed the pickup door again, went back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  They heard another shot and then you came back without the goat. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  They said they hurried back to work before you decided they were next. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=103.14000000000001s)]
*  She put that in the book? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=107.64000000000001s)]
*  That? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  Now in the past week, Noem had been on a publicity tour for that book, which was obviously envisioned [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=113.3s)]
*  as part of a campaign to position herself as Donald Trump's possible vice presidential [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=118.62s)]
*  nominee. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=123.22s)]
*  Unfortunately for Noem, it is not really playing out that way. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=124.22s)]
*  The book rollout has been an unmitigated disaster, the worst I've seen in a while. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=128.3s)]
*  In fact, I didn't even know it was possible anymore in American politics to have as bad [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  of a week as Kristi Noem has had. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=136.82s)]
*  We've all gotten used to so much insanity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=139.78s)]
*  I mean, the guy at the top of the Republican ticket for whom she's auditioning is sitting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=141.38s)]
*  in a New York courthouse while an adult film actress talks about him paying her off so [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  she wouldn't talk about a trish between them that she said was the definition of bad sex. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=148.94s)]
*  And yet even under our new political rules, Kristi Noem has managed to implode spectacularly. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=154.86s)]
*  Not simply because she killed an untrained puppy that did not hunt and a goat that smelled, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=161.02s)]
*  but because her response was to keep the story alive and even embellish it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=166.94s)]
*  The truth of the story is that this was a working dog and it was not a puppy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=171.9s)]
*  It was a dog that was extremely dangerous. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=177.34s)]
*  Now at one point, Greta Van Susteren tried to throw Noem a lifeline on Good Old Newsmax, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=181.54s)]
*  pivoting from the puppy she shot and killed and the goat she shot and killed to the not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=186.34s)]
*  one, not two, but three horses Noem reluctantly had to put down in that same gravel pit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=190.62s)]
*  These horses were old. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=197.22s)]
*  They were in their late, late 20s. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=198.74s)]
*  They were rodeo horses, ranch horses, and they raised my girls. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=200.34s)]
*  They took care of them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=204.74s)]
*  Amazingly, showing the pictures of the horses in the gravel pit and adding to the number [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=208.34s)]
*  of animals that she's had to kill did not boost her chances. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=213.3s)]
*  But then another problem was discovered. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=218.74s)]
*  Noem wrote in the book that she met North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and stared him down. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=221.3s)]
*  But it never happened and it got pulled from the book. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=227.38s)]
*  The thing is, it wasn't just a lie. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=230.42s)]
*  It was a lie so ludicrous it demonstrated just how little she understands world affairs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=232.34s)]
*  In what universe is the leader of the so-called hermit kingdom meeting with the governor of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=237.78s)]
*  South Dakota? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=242.18s)]
*  Did Noem go on a little junket to Pyongyang? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=243.54s)]
*  Kim do a state visit to Pierre that somehow flew under the radar. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=246.5s)]
*  It was a dumpster fire and she kept throwing fuel on it, leading to some of the most genuinely [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=251.86s)]
*  heart-stopping interview moments on live TV I've ever seen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=258.58s)]
*  So you did not meet with Kim Jong-un? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=262.1s)]
*  That's what you're saying? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=264.98s)]
*  No I've met with many, many world leaders. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=267.7s)]
*  Many world leaders. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=269.54s)]
*  I've traveled around the world. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=270.54s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=271.54s)]
*  I'm just not going to do that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=274.5s)]
*  It's a simple question. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=276.06s)]
*  Did you or did you not meet with Kim Jong-un? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=277.06s)]
*  That's the answer that I have for you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=278.78s)]
*  Why am I being treated differently than every other person that you've interviewed? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=280.38s)]
*  I've looked at your last several weeks. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=284.06s)]
*  If you were writing the book today, would you include the dog story? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=286.14s)]
*  This is a wonderful book. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=290.02s)]
*  Did you read the book? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=291.18s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=292.34s)]
*  Oh you should. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=293.34s)]
*  We've been consumed with emails saying I won't vote for this person. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=294.34s)]
*  I won't vote for Trump if he puts her in the vice presidential spot. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=296.98s)]
*  Well I'll tell you Stuart, I'm sorry you're not hearing from real Americans that live [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  on farms and ranches. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=304.98s)]
*  If governor, if you asked me a month ago who's at the top of the list to run with Donald [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  Trump, I would have said your name. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=310.02s)]
*  If you asked me that same question this morning, I don't even think you're on the list. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=312.14s)]
*  So my question for you, yes really. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=315.38s)]
*  No one was getting beaten up so badly that she stopped doing interviews altogether. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=318.46s)]
*  She even canceled on Fox News, which they did not take well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=321.94s)]
*  Today she canceled on us. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=326.41999999999996s)]
*  The one time I actually read the book. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=329.02s)]
*  We're moving forward with the interview. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=330.74s)]
*  Standing in for Kristi Noem is somebody she wished she had listened to before she ever [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  wrote the stupid book. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=336.82s)]
*  Dana Perino. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=338.34s)]
*  So Dana, aka Governor Noem, did you write the book yourself? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=339.34s)]
*  You know that's a great question for someone who wrote the book and I don't think I will [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=348.26s)]
*  dignify your question with a response. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=354.9s)]
*  There are so many other important issues in the world like animal cruelty. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=356.85999999999996s)]
*  Okay you gotta agree on a curve, it's not a comedy show. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  But if you think that's vicious, you should read the Amazon reviews of Noem's book, which [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=365.18s)]
*  the retail giant locked down after a flood of what they called unusual reviewing activity, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=370.18s)]
*  including one reader who said my cat loved this book. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=376.18s)]
*  He says Cricket was asking for it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=378.66s)]
*  So where does Governor Kristi Noem go from here? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=382.26s)]
*  Apparently back home. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=385.18s)]
*  A spokesman for Kristi Noem now says she has left her book tour, is going back to South [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=386.18s)]
*  to be prepared for some potential emerging bad weather systems. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=391.58s)]
*  The title of Noem's book, by the way, is, wait for it, No Going Back. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=396.06s)]
*  That is perfect. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=402.26s)]
*  I have no notes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHUzMuxOxqc&t=403.26s)]
