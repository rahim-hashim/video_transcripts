# ‘Infrastructure miracle:’ How Pennsylvania fixed I-95 in less than two weeks
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM)
*  One of the worst infrastructure disasters in years, a tanker truck carrying 8,500 gallons of gasoline [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=0.0s)]
*  overturned underneath an I-95 overpass in Philadelphia 10 days ago. The truck caught on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=6.32s)]
*  fire, killing a driver and destroying the overpass entirely. Now, this is one of the most critical [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=12.24s)]
*  interstate corridors in the country stretching from the Canadian border with Maine down to Miami. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=17.6s)]
*  Millions and millions of people up and down the eastern seaboard rely on it, and more than 160,000 [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=22.48s)]
*  vehicles normally travel over just that one section of I-95 in northeast Philly every day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=28.4s)]
*  The damage from the fire was so extensive an entire section of the road collapsed, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=34.48s)]
*  and local residents worried it would take months to fix. I do construction for construction company [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=38.56s)]
*  up in Doylestown, and I'm up and down 95 all day long all the time. Chris Corneen predicts his [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  commute will now take an hour longer every day. How much early am I gonna have to leave? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=50.0s)]
*  And my girlfriend, how much early is she gonna have to leave? Because [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=55.12s)]
*  the boulevard is gonna be crazy. But the new governor of Pennsylvania was determined to get [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  the freeway rebuilt as quickly as possible. Josh Shapiro issued a disaster declaration last week, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=65.36s)]
*  allowing repairs to be accelerated and releasing seven million dollars in state funds. Plus, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=70.8s)]
*  is the backing of the federal government, which is expected to cover the repair costs, estimated to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  top out around 30 million dollars. Union crews have been working 24 hours a day in 12-hour shifts, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=80.24s)]
*  and amazingly, they have already nearly completed a temporary road web. It's filled in with an [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=86.88s)]
*  aggregate material made from recycled glass from a company in nearby Delaware County, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  which means the interstate could now be open by the end of the week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=98.0s)]
*  Based on the tremendous progress that we have made over the last 72 hours, and the time it takes [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  to complete the remaining steps, I can confidently state right here, right now, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=109.36s)]
*  the traffic will be flowing here on I-95 this weekend. This weekend. That's incredibly fast. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=115.44s)]
*  Just to put this in perspective, when something similar happened in Atlanta in 2017, a section of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=124.64s)]
*  I-85 collapsed after a fire. It took a month and a half to get the road open. But this repair in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=129.28s)]
*  Philadelphia will take just two weeks, a third of the time. And it's one of those things that are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=134.96s)]
*  good on both the politics and the substance. Governor Shapiro put himself out there, promised [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  to put the full weight of the government behind the rebuild, and sure looks like he delivered. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  To the gratitude of the residents who depend on the interstate every day. In fact, the live [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  stream of the construction project is so popular in Philadelphia right now, the Phillies even put [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=152.72s)]
*  it up on the scoreboard during last night's game. It all shows you can do big infrastructure projects [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=157.68s)]
*  with the right political will. It also makes for, well, great politics. We're showing the rest of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=163.04s)]
*  the country that Philly and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we're tough. We're showing them what [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=169.2s)]
*  we are all about. We're showing them our grit and our resilience. This is what it looks like when the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=175.04s)]
*  ingenuity of Delco meets the grit of Philly and we work together to get it done. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tRnA9QeTYM&t=181.2s)]
