# ‘Distract and divide’ Sarah McBride reacts to Trump campaign’s anti-trans ads
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM)
*  One of the historic bright spots out of Tuesday's election is the fact for the first time in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=0.0s)]
*  America's history, someone who's openly transgender will be a member of Congress. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=4.0s)]
*  And young to boot, 34-year-old Sarah McBride, who previously served two terms as a state [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  senator in Delaware, won her seat with almost 60 percent of the vote. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=12.48s)]
*  This is on the heels of the Republican Party leaning into the demonization of trans folks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=16.2s)]
*  and spending hundreds of millions of dollars on anti-transgender ads this election cycle. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=20.44s)]
*  Joining me now, the newly elected representative from Delaware, Sarah McBride. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=28.52s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=30.0s)]
*  How, I imagine, what a strange election night it must have been for you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=31.0s)]
*  It was an evening of a lot of mixed emotions, but I am so incredibly grateful to Delaware, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=35.64s)]
*  the state that helped raise me and shape me into the person that I am for giving me this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=42.16s)]
*  opportunity to serve and incredibly determined as I head down to D.C. to defend Delaware [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=46.04s)]
*  and defend our democracy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=52.4s)]
*  Your state, obviously it's a democratic state, it's a blue state, but you have the at-large [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=54.16s)]
*  seat, right? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=57.84s)]
*  You're like a senator, you represent the whole state. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=59.52s)]
*  And I've got to imagine there's people with all sorts of different kinds of politics across [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  the political spectrum, all kinds of different views. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=67.08s)]
*  What was your experience running that campaign? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=69.04s)]
*  Well, first off, I think this victory is a testament to Delawareans that in our state [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=71.64s)]
*  of neighbors we are fair-minded, that we judge candidates based on their ideas and not their [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=78.0s)]
*  identities. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=82.84s)]
*  And I think voters across the state of Delaware, Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  responded to our message of building a government that respects all of us, that respects all [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=89.72s)]
*  of us across all of our different backgrounds and of course across all of our different [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=95.44s)]
*  beliefs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=99.6s)]
*  And I think folks responded to the fact that during my time in the Delaware State Senate, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  I was really singularly focused on bringing down costs facing workers, their families, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=105.36s)]
*  and retirees. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=110.28s)]
*  I helped pass-paid family a medical leave. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=111.28s)]
*  I helped secure the largest investment in our state's Medicaid program since the Affordable [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=113.4s)]
*  Care Act passed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=117.24s)]
*  And I was able to do all of that with bipartisan support. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=118.76s)]
*  And we put forward a positive, inclusive message during the course of this year and a half [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=122.16s)]
*  long campaign. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=126.68s)]
*  And I think voters really responded to that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=128.28s)]
*  I want to play, if we got one of your campaign ads, just so folks get a sense, texture of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=130.32s)]
*  the campaign. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=137.36s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=138.36s)]
*  Sarah McBride helped raise the minimum wage. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=144.0s)]
*  She got paid leave for workers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  She got Democrats and Republicans to work together. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=149.08s)]
*  We're all in for Sarah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Carpenters. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=152.96s)]
*  Bus drivers. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=153.96s)]
*  Nurses. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=154.96s)]
*  She metal workers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=155.96s)]
*  Sarah sees us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  And she respects us. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  That's a damn good ad, man. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  That's, I mean, that is, that's focused in all the right places, I think. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  And it seemed to work. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=167.96s)]
*  It did because it really reflected, one, the diverse coalition that we built across the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  state of Delaware during the course of this campaign. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=177.0s)]
*  And it really focused on the issues that I was hearing from Delawareans across the state. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=179.48s)]
*  I was not hearing about these anti-trans attacks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  I was hearing about the cost of childcare, the cost of housing, the cost of health care. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=188.04s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=191.64s)]
*  Politics is a lot more about listening than people realize. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=192.64s)]
*  Like, you know, especially in a small state like the state that Joe Biden got his political [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=195.84s)]
*  start in, where you can actually talk to a shockingly high percentage of people in a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=201.28s)]
*  state that size, small geographical footprint. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=207.8s)]
*  You really do a lot of, it's just a lot, it's a lot of listening, I imagine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=212.72s)]
*  It's retail politics at its best. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=216.12s)]
*  I talk about the power of proximity. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=218.28s)]
*  And I think in a state as small as Delaware, we are able to see our fellow citizens as [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=220.64s)]
*  neighbors, not as enemies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=225.84s)]
*  And we're able to move past a lot of the toxicity in our national politics. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=228.0s)]
*  Just today, actually, I was in southern Delaware, one of the red county in our state, Sussex [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  County, for what's called Return Day, where Democratic and Republican candidates come [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=236.76s)]
*  together to literally bury a ceremonial hatchet to mark the end of the election season. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=240.4s)]
*  And it's that type... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  It's an old tradition. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  It's an old tradition, but it really reflects our approach to politics in Delaware and the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  fact that we recognize that a different kind of politics is possible. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=253.08s)]
*  You're going to go to a different place with a very different politics. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=256.6s)]
*  And you're going to be there as genuinely as a pioneer, which is a remarkable thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=260.12s)]
*  And also in an atmosphere where, I've got to say, I've got trans folks in my life that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=266.36s)]
*  I love dearly and want to stand in solidarity with them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=270.88s)]
*  And I myself, as a person who's not on the... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, who's just a cis, white, straight dude, I was upset and ticked off and viscerally [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=281.28s)]
*  just really wound up every one time I saw one of those GD ads. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=289.0s)]
*  And how did you feel and how do you feel like trans folks are feeling right now? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=293.84s)]
*  Well, I think folks across this country right now are scared. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  I think folks across this country are facing a crisis of hope. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=303.48s)]
*  And I think those ads were part of a long-term strategy by the far right wing in this country, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=308.68s)]
*  which is a strategy to pick a small and vulnerable, misunderstood community to fear monger and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=316.64s)]
*  scapegoat around in order to distract and divide from the fact that those far right [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=321.68s)]
*  wing politicians have absolutely no policy solutions for the issues that are actually [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=326.32s)]
*  keeping people up at night. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=330.84s)]
*  My favorite part of this on the old one too is after they ran $100, $150 million in those [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=331.88s)]
*  ads, today it's about... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  Today the headlines are CEOs and folks on Wall Street meeting with the incoming president [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=339.52s)]
*  for like the deregulatory tax cut agenda. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=344.67999999999995s)]
*  It's like exactly, exactly like those are what you run the ads on and that's the agenda [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  on day one. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=352.4s)]
*  What we know are democratic policies are popular. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=353.4s)]
*  People want paid family and medical leave. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  They want affordable childcare and housing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=358.28s)]
*  They want accessible and affordable healthcare. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=360.04s)]
*  And these ads were an attempt to distract from the fact that Donald Trump's going to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  implement 20% sales tax on American workers, that he's going to cut regulations that put [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  workers at risk. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=372.56s)]
*  He's going to decrease taxes on the wealthiest in our country and continue to slash critical [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  benefits that Americans rely on. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=380.6s)]
*  And look, you know, these ads, I think we obviously are going to have a long conversation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  about why this election turned out the way it did. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  But I think as you were talking about earlier in the program, this is not a good time to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=394.24s)]
*  be a party in power across practically every liberal democracy across around the world. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=398.92s)]
*  And these ads were, I think, a separate issue entirely. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=405.68s)]
*  When I was hearing from undecided voters when I was talking to them was they felt like [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=411.84s)]
*  the economy was better under Donald Trump and that we survived four years. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=415.96s)]
*  And obviously, I disagree with that perspective, but that seemed to be driving people. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  Congresswoman-elect Sarah McBride is going to be gone for new member orientation soon. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=425.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  That's really a pleasure. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=430.67999999999995s)]
*  Thanks for coming up. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=431.67999999999995s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PzWOUEiYNM&t=441.84s)]
