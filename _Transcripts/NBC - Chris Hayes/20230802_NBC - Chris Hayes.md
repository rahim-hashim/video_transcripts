Video Description: “The circumstance that we find ourselves in today with an ex-president joining that list of people charged under 18 U-S-C section 241 is on the one hand unprecedented – in the defendant's level of power and the breadth of the offense,” says Chris Hayes. “And on the other hand, firmly rooted in the ugliest and oldest American tradition: the opposition, by any means necessary, to the promise of full, multiracial democratic equality.”

# ‘Conspiracy against rights’ Trump charged under anti-KKK law with long history
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU)
*  In the final words of the 45-page criminal indictment of Donald Trump, prosecutor Jack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=0.0s)]
*  Smith ends the document with the fourth charge against the ex-president, conspiracy against [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=4.18s)]
*  rights. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=9.28s)]
*  Quote, defendant Donald J. Trump did knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=10.28s)]
*  with co-conspirators, known and unknown to the grand jury, to injure or press, threaten [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  and intimidate one or more persons in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=19.34s)]
*  privilege secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=23.84s)]
*  That is the right to vote and to have one's vote counted. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=27.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is the first president to be charged with section 241 of Title 18 of the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=31.74s)]
*  U.S. Code, but he's far from the first person charged with it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=36.18s)]
*  Now the section number probably doesn't mean much to anyone, but it is from the first series [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=39.66s)]
*  of Reconstruction-era acts known as the Ku Klux Klan acts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=45.82s)]
*  Some of the first charges brought under this law were over 100 years ago against two elections [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=50.94s)]
*  board officials in Blaine County, Oklahoma. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=56.1s)]
*  The men were part of a three-person board and during the 1912 election, they engaged [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  a conspiracy that, quote, left out of their official canvas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  All the votes from 11 precincts were the grandfather clause. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=67.54s)]
*  A Jim Crow-era law to disenfranchise black citizens had not been zealously enforced. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=70.9s)]
*  The result was to drop some 1,200 votes, mainly cast by black and native citizens. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=76.18s)]
*  The conspiracy led to a narrow loss by a House candidate who should have rightfully [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=82.82s)]
*  won. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=86.82s)]
*  The law has been used to punish all kinds of intimidation since then, according to the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=87.82s)]
*  Washington Post, including to prosecute members of the KKK who carried out the 1964 Freedom [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  Summer Murders, as well as the 1999 indictment of a KKK member who oversaw the burning of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=96.86s)]
*  a cross in the front yard of a Puerto Rican man and his Mexican wife. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=102.16s)]
*  There's even someone waiting to be sentenced under the statute this fall. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  Back in March, a Trump supporter named Douglas Mackey was convicted of using Twitter to disenfranchise [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=108.98s)]
*  voters in the 2016 election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=114.9s)]
*  With the help of Russian troll farm, Mackey spread misinformation about voting, posting [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=117.62s)]
*  tweets like this one targeting people of color who supported Hillary Clinton falsely claiming [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  they could vote by text message. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=127.72s)]
*  He's awaiting sentencing, that guy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  The circumstance that we find ourselves in today with an ex-president joining that list [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  of people charged under 18 USC Section 241 is on the one hand unprecedented in the defendant's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=135.66s)]
*  level of power, the breadth of the offense, and on the other hand, firmly rooted in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlRRhqgrauU&t=141.94s)]
