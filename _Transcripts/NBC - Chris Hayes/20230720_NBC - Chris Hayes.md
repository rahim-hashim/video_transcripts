Video Description: “No Labels may claim to be unaffiliated with any party,” says Ali Velshi. “But – and this is a big but – when you look at what the group wants to do, one is left with the impression that it is effectively operating as a trojan horse to help elect Republicans.”

# ‘Dangerous vanity project’ How a third-party candidate could help Donald Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I)
*  You've probably heard of the political organization called No Labels. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=0.0s)]
*  It's one of those groups that vacuums up a lot of donor money by claiming to be bipartisan [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=4.32s)]
*  without offering any real solutions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=8.56s)]
*  One glance at the organization's scant platform reveals the same platitudes that voters have [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=10.92s)]
*  been hearing for years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=15.4s)]
*  Stuff like, quote, America must strike a balance between protecting women's rights to control [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  their own reproductive health and our society's responsibility to protect human life. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=21.88s)]
*  End quote. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=27.12s)]
*  Americans have a constitutional right to own guns, but society has a responsibility to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=28.12s)]
*  keep dangerous weapons away from dangerous people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=32.56s)]
*  End quote. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  That's fantastic stuff. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Despite that less than inspiring message, No Labels has some pretty ambitious plans [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=37.92s)]
*  and wants to run a so-called centrist candidate for president. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=42.6s)]
*  And while No Labels may call itself bipartisan, it's pretty obvious to anyone paying attention [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  that such a plan could help reelect Donald Trump by siphoning moderate voters away from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=50.64s)]
*  Joe Biden, the only candidate who has a substantial base of moderate voters. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=55.84s)]
*  But don't take my word for it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  Listen to one of the group's former top advisors who quit this year over the plan to run a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  third party candidate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  I do not believe that an independent, bipartisan third party ticket has any chance of success [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=70.38000000000001s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  I fear that despite its intentions to the contrary, if it proceeds, it will end up helping [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=84.02s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=94.1s)]
*  The Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah said effectively the same thing, telling The [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  Hill unequivocally, quote, the No Labels effort would elect Donald Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=99.84s)]
*  Going on to say, quote, I asked my chief strategist, what would a candidate have to be like in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  order to draw voters from Donald Trump as opposed to drawing from Joe Biden? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=110.02s)]
*  He said it would have to be someone to the right of Donald Trump, end quote. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=115.88s)]
*  No Labels may claim to be unaffiliated with any party, but, and this is a big but, when [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=121.28s)]
*  you look at what the group wants to do, one is left with the impression that it is effectively [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=126.5s)]
*  operating as a Trojan horse to help elect Republicans, especially considering how steadfastly [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=131.22s)]
*  is refusing to reveal its donor list, something that would give all of us a better insight [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=138.36s)]
*  into who exactly wants to see a spoiler candidate run next year. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Von Hill, you recently pressed the group's founder on this matter. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=149.0s)]
*  Listen to how that went. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Why not reveal your donors? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=156.86s)]
*  Because the truth is about the time in which we live in, you reveal, first of all, we're [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=159.24s)]
*  not a party. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  You're registering as a political party. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=166.6s)]
*  But that's just language. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  But we know how the game works in politics these days. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  It's not that people really want to see the donors because there's nothing nefarious going [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=173.76s)]
*  on here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=177.2s)]
*  It's because they- [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=178.2s)]
*  Why should they trust that, though? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=179.2s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=180.2s)]
*  They're going to have to see us through our work. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=181.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=183.2s)]
*  Now, no Labels may not want to reveal its donors, but Mother Jones got its hand on a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  partial list of them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=188.72s)]
*  And while some have indeed donated to both parties, as many ultra-rich donors do, the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=190.72s)]
*  report found, quote, generally these no-Label supporters appear to favor conservative candidates. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=196.44s)]
*  We know the ultra-conservative billionaire Harlan Crowe, the man who takes Supreme Court [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=202.28s)]
*  Justice Clarence Thomas on all those expensive vacations, has funded the group in the past. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=206.64s)]
*  Mother Jones uncovered multiple Donald Trump donors who gave to no labels, as well as a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  private equity baron who regularly gives six-figure donations to Republicans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=216.56s)]
*  And a natural gas billionaire named Michael Smith, who has donated millions to Mitch McConnell's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=222.4s)]
*  super PAC. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=227.56s)]
*  Now, to be fair, Michael Smith has also donated to the conservative West Virginia Democrat [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=228.56s)]
*  Joe Manchin, which is interesting because Joe Manchin is very publicly flirting with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=233.28s)]
*  the idea that he could run as the no-Label's, spoiler, presidential candidate. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=239.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=246.0s)]
*  Joe Manchin, Senator Manchin, the man who spent the last two and a half years stymieing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=247.0s)]
*  President Biden's agenda, is now apparently looking to bump Biden from office entirely. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=250.96s)]
*  We're going to have much more on Senator Manchin's dangerous vanity project after this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=256.04s)]
*  . [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7uNOfSq7I&t=276.0s)]
