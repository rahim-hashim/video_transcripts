# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 14
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Tonight it feels like another line has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=0.0s)]
*  crossed in American democracy with the discovery that the United States senators feeling the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=4.2s)]
*  threat of violence to them or their families from Donald Trump and his supporters changed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=9.02s)]
*  their votes on perhaps the most important vote many of them ever took, the second impeachment [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=13.66s)]
*  of Donald Trump. Of course, that fateful vote, acquitting Trump of inciting an insurrection [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=18.96s)]
*  on January 6th, allowed for the situation we currently find ourselves in with that four-time [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=24.8s)]
*  criminally indicted defendant likely to be a coin flip away from the presidency next [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  year. This new revelation about the impact of the MAGA threat of violence in Congress [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=34.24s)]
*  comes from an explosive excerpt of a forthcoming biography of Utah Senator Mitt Romney as told [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=39.7s)]
*  by author McKay Coppens, quote, when one senator, a member of leadership, said he was leaning [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  toward voting to convict Trump, the others urged him to reconsider. You can't do that, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=50.88s)]
*  Romney recalled someone saying. Think of your personal safety, said another. Think of your [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=57.72s)]
*  children. McKay Coppens received unparalleled access to Senator Romney, who gave his apparently [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=63.0s)]
*  unvarnished thoughts and observations to his biographer. And Romney's revelation about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=69.26s)]
*  the second impeachment vote really connects the dots in the story of how Trump and his [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=74.16s)]
*  movement have used and continue to use intimidation, menace to pursue their political [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=78.2s)]
*  ends. It's a story that we've covered quite a bit on this program, but I think it remains [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=84.76s)]
*  somewhat untold because, of course, many people don't want to publicize their security concerns. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=89.92s)]
*  Those who have been the target of Donald Trump's invective or targeted by his followers mostly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=96.94s)]
*  don't want to talk to the press about it and invite greater threat. Now, a few figures [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=101.26s)]
*  have bravely come forward to confirm the dangers they have faced for standing in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=105.94s)]
*  way, like former Congressman Peter Meyer of Michigan and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=109.46s)]
*  both shared details about the death threats they received after voting for Trump's second [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=114.14s)]
*  impeachment. So I'll tell you, the threats are constant. They've increased. You know, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=119.42s)]
*  I even heard a voicemail just this morning that we got last night threatening execution. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=126.18s)]
*  It's kind of seems to be the normal thing nowadays was just threaten execution. We have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=130.82s)]
*  security. We've had to up our security posture and we're aware, but we're going to move on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=136.26s)]
*  It's not going to hinder us and it's not going to intimidate us. Now, to be clear, all sorts [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=141.9s)]
*  of people in public life across the political spectrum receive threats. Unfortunately, that's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=146.1s)]
*  sort of part of how things operate these days. That's not new. There's something different [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=149.42s)]
*  here, right? In the age of Trump, those threats became very real and acute. During his first [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=154.22s)]
*  run for president, Donald Trump explicitly encouraged violence among his supporters. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=159.82s)]
*  He told them at his rallies, quote, knock the crap out of any protesters and I'll pay [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  the legal fees. And we've seen that endorsement of violence take hold among his supporters. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=167.94s)]
*  We've seen pipe bombs mailed to his perceived political enemies and planted the DNC and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=173.9s)]
*  RNC on the eve of January 6th. We saw the home of Speaker Nancy Pelosi invaded, her [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  husband attacked with a hammer. This is not an abstraction. We've seen it. The threat [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=182.66s)]
*  of violence in the Trump era is tangible and it comes with serious costs, emotional [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=189.48s)]
*  and psychological ones, as well as just concrete dollars and cents financial costs. Many people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=194.04s)]
*  who have found themselves targeted by Donald Trump or his followers do not necessarily [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=201.32s)]
*  have the means to secure 24 seven security for themselves and their families. Mitt Romney [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  actually lays this out to make hay copies. Most members of Congress don't have security [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=212.32s)]
*  details. Their addresses are publicly available online. Romney himself had been shelling out [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=216.08s)]
*  $5,000 a day since the January 6th riot to cover private security for his family and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=221.0s)]
*  expense he knew most of his colleagues couldn't afford. Someone like Romney who can pay that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=227.58s)]
*  staggering amount, it's probably a prudent expense given the fact that he's become a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  top MAGA enemy. You may remember Romney was the only Republican senator to vote for the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=238.28s)]
*  first impeachment of Donald Trump. And at the time he delivered a moving, forceful, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=244.16s)]
*  persuasive speech explaining how seriously he took that decision and why it mattered [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=248.96s)]
*  so much to him. As a senator juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=253.64s)]
*  I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=264.0s)]
*  God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=283.24s)]
*  the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=289.44s)]
*  ever faced. I was not wrong. That was just the beginning of Romney's defiance to the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=295.52s)]
*  trumpling of his party and the peril he would face as a result. As Romney told his biographer [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=301.52s)]
*  ahead of January 6th, he received a warning from one of his colleagues, Angus King of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=307.14s)]
*  Maine who's an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and quote, King informs him [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=311.52s)]
*  of a conversation he's just had with a high ranking Pentagon official. Law enforcement [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=315.62s)]
*  has been tracking online chatter among right wing extremists. Romney's name has been popping [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=320.7s)]
*  up in some frightening corners of the internet. He isn't sure Romney will be safe. Romney [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=325.5s)]
*  immediately texted the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell telling him about the call [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=330.86s)]
*  from King quote, there are calls to burn down your home Mitch to smuggle guns into DC and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=334.86s)]
*  to storm the Capitol. I hope that sufficient security plans are in place, but I am concerned [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=340.1s)]
*  the instigator, the president, is the one who commands the reinforcements the DC and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=345.86s)]
*  Capitol police might require. What did Mitch McConnell say? Never even bothered to respond. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=350.22s)]
*  So just imagine how Mitt Romney and his other colleagues who received those warnings were [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  feeling going into the Capitol on January 6th and when he was rushed off the Senate [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=362.04s)]
*  floor after rioters breached the building and nearly ran straight into the violent mob. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=366.76s)]
*  Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman guided him to safety as you can see in this now infamous [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=373.84s)]
*  clip. Romney and the rest of the senators then spent hours hunkered down in a secure [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  location while the mob rampaged to the Capitol assaulting officers including Goodman. In [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=382.92s)]
*  the wake of that awful day the members of Congress were faced with the question of whether [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=389.36s)]
*  to impeach and convict Donald Trump for the crime of inciting insurrection. They all knew [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=392.6s)]
*  to a person he did it. They were there. We all saw it. Their lives were at risk. And [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  as several Republicans told Romney they wanted to vote to convict, but they were afraid. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  Quote, one Republican congressman confided to Romney that he wanted to vote for Trump's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  second impeachment but chose not to out of fear for his family's safety. The congressman [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=415.12s)]
*  reasoned that Trump would be impeached by House Democrats with or without him. Why put [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=420.18s)]
*  his wife and children at risk if it wouldn't change the outcome? Later during the Senate [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=424.06s)]
*  trial Romney heard the same calculation while talking with a small group of Republican colleagues [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=428.62s)]
*  when one senator, a member of leadership, said he was leaning toward voting to convict [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=433.42s)]
*  the others urged him to reconsider. You can't do that Romney recalled someone saying. Think [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=438.7s)]
*  of your personal safety said another. Think of your children. The senator eventually decided [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=444.22s)]
*  they were right. Mitt Romney was one of just seven Republican senators to vote to convict [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=448.78s)]
*  Trump. He was able to make a different calculation than many of his colleagues. He's got no political [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=454.58s)]
*  ambitions past this office. He's retiring next year. He's independently phenomenally [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=460.02s)]
*  wealthy. He can afford $5,000 a day to protect himself and his family. The combination of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=464.82s)]
*  that unique position dependent on basically no one and his character, his faith, means [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=470.02s)]
*  that he was able to do what many others could not or would not. But it is maddening to think [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=475.82s)]
*  that others might have followed and Donald Trump might have been convicted. But for the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=481.26s)]
*  fear that the violent mob that had just sacked the Capitol would hunt down those who voted [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=486.58s)]
*  yes. We are now closing out the most active summer for union organizing and strikes. I [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=493.06s)]
*  can remember my lifetime. You got the writers guild and the screen actors guild both still [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=499.58s)]
*  on strike. The teamsters union came within days of a nationwide strike against UPS and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=503.90000000000003s)]
*  then struck a contract today. Probably the most legendary story union in this nation, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=508.3s)]
*  the United Auto Workers faces a deadline for reaching an agreement with the big three automakers [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=513.86s)]
*  in just a few minutes at 10 p.m. Eastern. The union president is scheduled to tell his [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=519.7s)]
*  members which plants they will start striking if no agreement is reached by midnight. He [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  sounds pretty determined in his speech to members yesterday. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=528.9s)]
*  They could double our wages and not raise car prices and still make billions of dollars in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=533.94s)]
*  profit. They want to scare the American people into thinking that auto workers are the problem. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=540.94s)]
*  We're not the problem. That chart is the problem. Corporate greed is the problem. And come [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=547.3000000000001s)]
*  tomorrow night, if they force us, we're about to make it the big threes problem. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=555.5s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, chairs the health, education, labor and pensions [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=562.06s)]
*  committee. He's scheduled to join the man you saw there, Sean Fain, UAW president for [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=566.4599999999999s)]
*  a rally in Detroit tomorrow. And he joins me now. Senator, do you have a obviously I [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=570.18s)]
*  know you support the union. You'll be there with the union tomorrow. Do you have a kind [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=575.66s)]
*  of rooting interest here of the outcome you want to see? Yeah, the outcome I want to see [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=578.8199999999999s)]
*  is that the UAW workers get the kind of contract they deserve. You know, the corporate media [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=583.5s)]
*  hasn't covered this very well. But the reality is over the last 20 years, real wages for [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=590.74s)]
*  automobile workers has gone down by 30 percent when you account for inflation. So what the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=596.74s)]
*  workers are saying is at a time when the CEOs afford, he makes 21 million. The guy who's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=602.3s)]
*  head of Stellantis, he makes 25 million a year. Norman, who's head of General Motors, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=609.86s)]
*  their salaries have gone up by 40 percent over the last four years. They have billions of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=616.3s)]
*  dollars for dividends and stock buybacks. And what the workers are saying is, hey, we made [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=622.06s)]
*  you those profits. We gave you those salaries. Pay attention to our needs. We don't want [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=627.02s)]
*  to see a situation where workers at the low end make it all of 17 bucks an hour. And I'll [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=632.62s)]
*  tell you something, Chris, you mentioned that all over this country we're seeing strikes [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=638.06s)]
*  and you're right. And I think what's happening is working people all across this country [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=641.58s)]
*  are sick and tired of the corporate greed they are seeing every day. They see it when [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=646.62s)]
*  they go to the grocery store. Food prices, incredibly high. Gas prices, incredibly high. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=651.5s)]
*  Companies making money hands over fist. And I really applaud the courage of Sean Fain [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=656.7s)]
*  and the workers at the UAW for standing up and saying, you know what, enough is enough. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=662.22s)]
*  We need an economy that works for everybody, not just the people on top. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=666.98s)]
*  I want to show some of the demands at UAW, a 36 percent wage increase over four years. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=671.14s)]
*  One of the things I want to do, this is actually a key one, and this is a little in the weeds, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=677.26s)]
*  but it's important for people to recognize, there are sort of these tiers that have emerged [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=679.86s)]
*  in successive rounds of organizing where newer workers aren't working at the same tier as [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=684.02s)]
*  others. It's a way of kind of breaking up the solidarity of the union. It's something [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  that Sean Fain has been opposed to and the folks that elected him. So we'll see how that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=692.38s)]
*  goes. I want to ask you this question on that context. We have seen all of this union activity [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=697.3399999999999s)]
*  at Starbucks and Amazon, the Teamsters and UPS. You said workers are waking up, but it [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=702.9399999999999s)]
*  strikes me that part of the issue here is that you've got tight labor markets. And employees [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=711.62s)]
*  have more choice now than they did during that long period after Great Recession where [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=716.7399999999999s)]
*  you had a lot of slack in the labor market, six, seven, eight percent unemployment. People [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=721.3s)]
*  were worried they were replaceable. This, it seems to me, this environment has given workers [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=725.06s)]
*  more say and more power in their negotiations with ownership. I think there is truth to that, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=731.38s)]
*  Chris, but I think it really goes deeper. I think COVID, the pandemic, was a real emotional wake [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=737.78s)]
*  up for the American people. You know, the rich people, the CEOs could stay at home and work [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=746.5s)]
*  in their fancy offices or in their homes behind their computers. Working people, people at the UAW, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=752.66s)]
*  bus drivers, people working in warehouses, nurses, doctors, they had to go out to work. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=759.38s)]
*  And tens and tens of thousands of them died. And meanwhile, during that whole pandemic, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=766.18s)]
*  we saw an explosion of wealth increases for the people on top. So yeah, the tight labor market is [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=771.38s)]
*  a factor, Chris. But I really think that people are becoming sick and tired of the massive levels [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=777.78s)]
*  of income and wealth inequality that they're seeing today. No one thinks that three people on [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=783.3s)]
*  top should own more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that CEOs are making 400 [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=788.3399999999999s)]
*  times more than their workers. That's not what this country is supposed to be about. That's what [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=794.5799999999999s)]
*  the UAW is telling the American people. And I think there's massive support for what they're trying to do. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=799.14s)]
*  I want to play this clip that got a lot of play. It sort of went viral. It's a sort of random clip [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=804.5s)]
*  because it's just an Australian property developer. But what he's articulating at this conference with [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=808.74s)]
*  other property developers is a view that I think some, a lot of people in management or ownership [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=814.42s)]
*  at least have about exactly this awakening that's happened post-COVID, right? That people have this [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=819.14s)]
*  sort of idea that like they want to be treated with dignity, they want fairness. This is him saying we [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=824.26s)]
*  need unemployment to rise to knock the arrogance out of these workers. Take a listen. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=828.82s)]
*  We need to see unemployment rise. Unemployment has to jump 40, 50 percent in my view. We need to see [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=834.66s)]
*  pain in the economy. We need to remind people that they work for the employer, not the other way around. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=839.7s)]
*  We need to remind people they work for the employer, not the other way around. What do you think of that? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=845.86s)]
*  I think it's disgusting. And it's, you know, hard to believe that you have that kind of mentality [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=849.94s)]
*  among the ruling class in the year 2023. You know, this is the richest country in the history of the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=855.3s)]
*  world and yet we still have 60 percent, 60 percent of our people living paycheck to paycheck. People [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=861.54s)]
*  can't afford housing. People can't afford health care. They can't afford child care. Can't afford [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=866.5s)]
*  to send their kids to college. And what these guys are saying, hey, this is all great working classes [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=870.0999999999999s)]
*  and disarray. Let's have more unemployment. We can get richer and richer, make them more and more [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=875.86s)]
*  desperate. That is the kind of greed and arrogance that the UAW and unions all over this country are [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=880.8199999999999s)]
*  standing up to. I applaud them and I would hope that all of us as Americans stand with the UAW [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=888.5s)]
*  in their struggle. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2w7IE_Pfk&t=895.38s)]
