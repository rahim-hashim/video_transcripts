# ‘On the right side’ Biden’s State of the Union showed his ‘greatest strengths’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. If there was ever any doubt the general election is here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=0.0s)]
*  it became absolutely clear in just the first 30 seconds, our president Joe Biden's State of the Union address last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=5.0s)]
*  Biden came to the stage as the nominee of his own party, facing his predecessor running yet again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=12.0s)]
*  And from the very first moments, Biden set the stakes of an existential battle over the future of American democracy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=18.0s)]
*  A battle represented by the man holding the presidency against the man who previously held it and lost it and then fomented a violent coup to try to retain it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=25.0s)]
*  It was an aggressive prosecution, the case right out of the gate. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=35.0s)]
*  It was aided by the fact that Republican Party and the right wing media, certainly and honestly a lot of the mainstream media, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=39.0s)]
*  has spent the past few years, particularly the past few months, caricaturing Joe Biden as impossibly feeble and doddering. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=45.0s)]
*  Well, he did not look that way last night. The president seemed to relish the constant outbursts and interjections and heckles from Republicans in the chamber. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=52.0s)]
*  One of my absolute favorite moments happened before the speech started as Biden made his way into the chamber shaking hands before he made this face after spotting Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's MAGA getup. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=60.0s)]
*  It's like the face of a grownup pretending to be scared by a six year old's Halloween costume. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=76.0s)]
*  Oh, look at this. You're a scary ghost. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=80.0s)]
*  But once he got to the podium and the speech started, he used every opportunity at his disposal to remind voters at home that on a range of key issues from Ukraine to January 6th, abortion rights to Obamacare, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=84.0s)]
*  Democrats are on the right side of public opinion, Republicans on the wrong side. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=95.0s)]
*  Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that needs to defend itself. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=102.0s)]
*  But now, assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=111.0s)]
*  Now, my predecessor, a former Republican president tells Putin, quote, do whatever the hell you want. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=119.0s)]
*  My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=127.0s)]
*  I will not do that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=132.0s)]
*  This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=134.0s)]
*  Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=138.0s)]
*  My God, what freedom else would you take away? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=144.0s)]
*  If you, the American people, send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you I'll restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=147.0s)]
*  My predecessor and many in this chamber want to take this red prescription drug away by repealing Affordable Care Act. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=156.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let that happen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=166.0s)]
*  At every turn, the messaging was clear. Democrats oppose Putin's aggression. Republicans apparently do not. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=169.0s)]
*  Democrats support American democracy. Republicans apparently do not. Democrats support reproductive freedom. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=175.0s)]
*  Republicans clearly do not. All culminating in a very telling exchange and perhaps the number one political priority for the Republican Party, tax cuts. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=180.0s)]
*  We have two ways to go. Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=190.0s)]
*  I will. That's the proposal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=198.0s)]
*  Oh, no, you guys don't want another two trillion dollar tax cut. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=202.0s)]
*  I kind of thought that's what your plan was. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=207.0s)]
*  Well, that's good to hear. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=211.0s)]
*  You're not going to cut another two trillion dollars for the superwealth. That's good to hear. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=213.0s)]
*  They are going to try to cut another two trillion dollars for the super wealthy when the Trump tax cuts expire in 2025. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=217.0s)]
*  It's a huge part of the agenda. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=223.0s)]
*  President Biden was reminding voters, all 32 million of them who tuned in last night, of the most unpopular moment of Donald Trump's presidency, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=225.0s)]
*  other than the days after January 6th, when Trump and Republicans in Congress forced through that massive tax cut for the wealthy and corporations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=233.0s)]
*  It was the only actual Republican policy victory on domestic policy of Trump's tenure in office, the biggest piece of legislation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=241.0s)]
*  Despite their local protestations last night, it is exactly what they will do again should they retake control of Congress in the White House. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=248.0s)]
*  They are, I will give them this, smart enough not to openly campaign on it because they know that cutting taxes for the wealthy, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=256.0s)]
*  further cutting taxes for corporations is an unbelievably unpopular political position. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=265.0s)]
*  The fact of the matter is everyone who pays attention to American politics knows this election, this campaign is going to be hard fought. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=271.0s)]
*  It's going to be a very close general election, I think, barring some unforeseen change of circumstances. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=278.0s)]
*  Joe Biden and the Democrats face some truly serious challenges ahead. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=283.0s)]
*  No doubt you've read about them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=286.0s)]
*  But last night was in some ways a display of what their greatest strengths are, their advantages. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=289.0s)]
*  And it's this, they are on the right side of the policy specifics, I mean the actual tangible things of governing, of nearly every, not every, but nearly every salient issue before voters. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=293.0s)]
*  It's especially true on abortion rights. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=307.0s)]
*  And as a result, there's this incredibly energized and mobilized base of tens of millions of people who have been showing up for basically every special election across America. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=310.0s)]
*  Since DOPS, in the midterms 2022 and 2023, to do whatever they can to enshrine reproductive freedoms into law, to beat back those who have supported those restrictions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=319.0s)]
*  And that said, by and large, the voters who show up to vote in off-year special elections, even in midterms, they're already incredibly motivated. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=333.0s)]
*  They tend not to be the ones that need to be persuaded. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=340.0s)]
*  For the voters on the margins who will decide this election and honestly the fate of the future trajectory of what we call American democracy, a lot of them just aren't paying attention to politics. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=343.0s)]
*  It's just not their thing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=356.0s)]
*  Today we saw a great example of this, an anecdote from Democratic pollster, Selinda Lake, about a recent focus group she held with swing voters. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=358.0s)]
*  Lake asked the voters about Trump's upcoming January 6 court cases. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=365.0s)]
*  Quote, they go, what court cases around January 6? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=369.0s)]
*  And Lake said, well, you know, the insurrection that he was the one that provoked it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=372.0s)]
*  They go, oh yeah, kind of forgot about that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=375.0s)]
*  Now, I want to be clear here, like, there's lots of things I don't pay attention to. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=379.0s)]
*  I've got this job and if you asked me about those things, I would sound the exact same way. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=384.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=389.0s)]
*  There's tons of examples of this stuff. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=390.0s)]
*  Take this Vox article summarizing focus groups with independent voters last spring. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=392.0s)]
*  Quote, in Michigan, a woman was asked how the two parties differ on abortion and how she would describe each party's position. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=396.0s)]
*  I'm not sure the woman answered. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=402.0s)]
*  I really haven't basically heard anything about which party is leaning towards it and which one isn't. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=404.0s)]
*  If I had to guess, I would say Democrat would probably be against abortion and Republican probably be for it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=408.0s)]
*  That same article shares another anecdote from a voter in North Carolina. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=415.0s)]
*  Quote, a participant said she wasn't sure where the parties stand on abortion and had been surprised Roe v. Wade was overturned under a Democrat. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=418.0s)]
*  OK, but did Joe Biden have a say in whether or not was overturned? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=426.0s)]
*  The focus group moderator asked. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=430.0s)]
*  No, but he helped get the Supreme Court judges where they are, the woman responded. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=432.0s)]
*  The moderator then informed the woman the most recent judges came in under Donald Trump. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=437.0s)]
*  I mean, again, it might seem obvious to those of us who are hyper engaged in politics, but all this stuff is super opaque to literally millions and millions of voters, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=442.0s)]
*  many of whom have just started paying attention the upcoming election aren't really even going to tune in fully for a while. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=453.0s)]
*  So this is crucial, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=460.0s)]
*  This was what I really took away from last night, the path that Biden's campaign recognized. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=462.0s)]
*  As people start to pay attention to this campaign to be proactive about telling voters what the two parties stand for, what the Democratic Joe Biden Kamala Harris agenda looks like, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=466.0s)]
*  what the Trump Republican Party agenda looks like and judging by last night, they're going to do so confidently, knowing they are on the right side of a whole host of issues. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=477.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGvQ2OSqso&t=496.0s)]
