# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE)
*  As we await potential indictment of the former president of the United States, we now have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=0.0s)]
*  what we believe to be the first ever recorded exchange with the man who is investigating [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  him, special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=8.36s)]
*  NBC News reporter Gary Grumbach managed to intercept him outside his office this morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=10.52s)]
*  You can see the special counsel on your screen there holding onto a Subway sandwich bag as [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=15.56s)]
*  he walks back to his office. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=19.6s)]
*  Here's the exchange. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=21.32s)]
*  Hey there, Mr. Smith. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=22.32s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=23.32s)]
*  Gary Grumbach from NBC News here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=24.32s)]
*  Is an indictment coming soon, sir? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=25.32s)]
*  Is an investigation wrapping up, sir? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=27.32s)]
*  Excuse us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Anything you'd like to say, Mr. Smith? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=32.56s)]
*  The answer to that is no. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=33.56s)]
*  Smith is tight-lipped, as he should be. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=38.56s)]
*  We can't expect any public pronouncements until there is an indictment, if there is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=52.44s)]
*  one, although current indications point in that direction. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=56.04s)]
*  Yesterday, Donald Trump's attorneys met with Jack Smith himself for roughly two hours after [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=60.44s)]
*  they requested and did not get a sit-down with Attorney General Merrick Garland. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=65.4s)]
*  That meeting seems to have irked the ex-president. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=70.72s)]
*  Mere minutes after it wrapped up, Trump was wailing about the possibility of an indictment [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=72.84s)]
*  on his social media platform. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=76.84s)]
*  New York Times even reported that Trump expects to face charges, according to people who have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=78.48s)]
*  spoken to him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=89.64s)]
*  Timothy Parlatori recently left Donald Trump's legal team handling the special counsel cases, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=91.2s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  I guess you have been... [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  You've said you wouldn't be surprised if he were not indicted up until now, and I just [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  wonder if the developments of the last few days, and particularly the meeting with DOJ, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=105.4s)]
*  changes how you're thinking about that likelihood. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, obviously, I have no idea what happened inside that meeting, but I evaluate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  this case based on what I know to be the facts and the law, as opposed to just what's been [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  publicly reported. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  My opinion, as a lawyer, is that this is something that shouldn't result in charges. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Will it result in charges? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=133.64s)]
*  That's kind of up in the air. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=137.32s)]
*  A lot of that goes down to what the prosecutors decide to do. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=138.32s)]
*  When you say shouldn't, I've seen some of your previous interviews about this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=142.04s)]
*  I guess the sort of core question I have... [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  I've been in a civil case, right, where someone says, you've got to hold documents for discovery. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  People take that very seriously, and these aren't sensitive national security stuff. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Just make sure you... [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=160.92s)]
*  And go and search your email and furnish it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  I just feel like if I did that and then four more times I was like, oh, here's some other [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=163.92s)]
*  stuff over the course of a year and a half, I would probably be in pretty big trouble, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=169.0s)]
*  like independent of whether I got charged or anything. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=174.4s)]
*  It just seems like that basic fact pattern is not something you generally want your client [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=176.4s)]
*  doing in any situation having to do with the providing of documents. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=181.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=187.36s)]
*  I mean, in retrospect, you can certainly take issue with the manner in which the initial [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=188.36s)]
*  searches were conducted. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=193.52s)]
*  One thing that I've always looked at with Ed is that when the subpoena first came out [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=196.28s)]
*  and Evan asked for additional time, they gave him a little bit of time, but not as much [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=201.56s)]
*  as he had asked for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=205.94000000000003s)]
*  And then he did the search that he did and gave them whatever he found within that period [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=207.68s)]
*  of time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  But see, ordinarily what happens is when I'm dealing with the U.S. Attorney's Office and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=213.92s)]
*  I say, look, I need more time, they'll say, look, give us what you can by that date, but [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=218.04s)]
*  we want you to keep searching thereafter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=223.04s)]
*  We recognize that this is going to be a much larger thing, so keep doing it on a rolling [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  basis. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  And that didn't happen here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  They gave him an extra week and they said, give us everything you find by that date. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=232.32s)]
*  And they kind of cut it off right there, which was weird. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=237.1s)]
*  Well, but there's two parts of that, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=240.64s)]
*  The timeline here is pretty long. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=242.96s)]
*  The guy leaves in January 2021. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=244.36s)]
*  He's not really giving over anything except for those 15 boxes almost a year later. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=247.12s)]
*  Then the subpoena happens months after that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=251.12s)]
*  Then the meeting happens after that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=253.12s)]
*  So this is not like an overnight situation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=254.44s)]
*  That seems like a long amount of time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=256.44s)]
*  Well, the time that I'm specifically talking about is in between the issuance of the subpoena [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=260.36s)]
*  and the compliance date. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=264.8s)]
*  All of the stuff that happened before that is, you know, when there is no criminal investigation, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=266.76s)]
*  it's really there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's relevant, but it has to be examined under the Presidential Records Act and what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  the ordinary procedures are on a transition. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=282.04s)]
*  But then the other thing about this is, so whether the compliance timeline was weird [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=283.04s)]
*  or not, the thing that also strikes me, you've got three or four asks, right, for documents. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=288.76s)]
*  Some are asks, some are compulsory, right? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=294.16s)]
*  Some are here's a subpoena, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=296.8s)]
*  And each time you don't get the full, you don't get all of them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=300.88s)]
*  And we know that as a matter of fact, that's just, you know, that those are the facts, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=302.88s)]
*  the question about the reason for that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=306.88s)]
*  But at one point you get an attestation signed by a lawyer being like, we've searched high [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=308.88s)]
*  and low and this is, as best we could tell, this is everything. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  And then you get a search by the FBI with like a hundred more docs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  It's just like, well, that, someone was wrong. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  Someone screwed this up. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, and, you know, the certification that was given at the time, you know, was largely [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=324.36s)]
*  a form, a standard form certification saying a diligent search has been conducted and, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=329.88000000000005s)]
*  you know, here are responsive documents. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=335.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  In retrospect, you know, could you sit here and say, you know, maybe it would have been [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  smarter to say all responsive documents that were found are attached. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't think that in the ordinary course of things, you know, that is kind of what [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  prosecutors of the other side would understand it to be. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=351.48s)]
*  You know, so, you know, he did use a standard form for that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=354.48s)]
*  I think that, you know, had there been a lot more cooperation on both sides, you know, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=360.12s)]
*  I'm not saying anything about, you know, Mr. Corcoran here, but I think that definitely [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=364.52s)]
*  in the ordinary course, you would have more cooperation communications, not only from [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=369.92s)]
*  the defense, but also from the DOJ side. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that the matter, really the matter which these communications happened, it led [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=376.8s)]
*  to that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=383.2s)]
*  Let me play William Barr making a somewhat similar point. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=384.2s)]
*  He's making it more about the Trump folks. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=386.32s)]
*  Basically, this was avoidable if he just handed stuff over. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=388.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  Based on the facts, as the facts come out, I think over time people will see that this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=394.56s)]
*  is not a case of the Department of Justice, you know, conducting a witch hunt. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  In fact, they approached this very delicately and with deference to the president. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=402.76s)]
*  And this would have gone nowhere had the president just returned the documents. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=406.76s)]
*  But he jerked them around for a year and a half. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=410.4s)]
*  And the question is, did he deceive them? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=412.08s)]
*  I mean, whether it's criminal or not, jerk them around for a year and a half does feel [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=415.44s)]
*  like it's the facts. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=419.76s)]
*  I don't know if that's chargeable, but it seems like a fair lay description of what [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=420.76s)]
*  went on. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  And a fairly uninformed one, unfortunately, because really we're talking about multiple [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=428.04s)]
*  phases here. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=431.86s)]
*  We're talking about the initial discussions between the president and the National Archives, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=432.86s)]
*  where he has the two years in which to review these documents. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=437.62s)]
*  They wanted them sooner. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=440.54s)]
*  And a lot of this comes down to the fact that the National Archives failed to get a facility [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=441.54s)]
*  in Palm Beach to store these documents as they have for every other former president [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  since the passing of the Presidential Records Act. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  They wanted all the boxes immediately returned back up to D.C. where he wouldn't have ready [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=453.04s)]
*  access to them to be able to review them as every other president has. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=457.16s)]
*  You have to kind of separate. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=462.7s)]
*  But let me just say this as a final word. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=465.61999999999995s)]
*  There's that administrative discussion. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=467.61999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=469.61999999999995s)]
*  The question, there's a question here of like, oh, did I miss these documents? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=470.61999999999995s)]
*  Or like, oh, no, no, I want these documents. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=473.78s)]
*  Those two you can argue in the alternative because you're a lawyer and that's what you [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=476.46s)]
*  do. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  But those two are in some logical tension. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not like, oh, I miss, I miss, I meant to give you guys, I didn't have it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  It's like, no, no, I want this document near me. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=485.14s)]
*  And if you look at what Trump says, it seems like a lot of it was that latter course, latter [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=487.78s)]
*  category, Tim Parlatory, who served as an attorney for the president. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=491.41999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=495.97999999999996s)]
*  As Donald Trump appears to be approaching his second criminal indictment in as many [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=500.97999999999996s)]
*  months, his allies in Congress are desperately trying to counter with their own scandal about [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  President Joe Biden. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=509.02s)]
*  Now, so far, I have to say they have come up shockingly empty, which is why they've [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=510.02s)]
*  tried to craft this big mystery about this unsubstantiated, unverified complaint to the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=514.42s)]
*  FBI, which they claim proves Biden and his family to bribes from foreign governments. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=519.74s)]
*  At issue is this 1023 form that an FBI whistleblower made you aware of that talks about specific [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=526.42s)]
*  actions Joe Biden may have taken in exchange for money. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=534.3399999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=539.02s)]
*  I mean, this is unbelievable. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=540.02s)]
*  This is corruption on a scale we've never seen in the history of our country. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=542.18s)]
*  This just isn't a document that's in the possession of the FBI. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=546.42s)]
*  This is a document they created and they created it based on what Jamie Comber just said. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  They had a credible source, one of their good sources. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=554.68s)]
*  OK, so they have this document, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=558.54s)]
*  The document, the magical document. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=562.38s)]
*  House Republicans are planning to vote on Thursday to hold FBI Director Chris Wray in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=565.8599999999999s)]
*  contempt of Congress for declining to turn over the magical document. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=569.42s)]
*  Except here's the thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=574.0999999999999s)]
*  House Oversight Committee Chair James Comber has already seen the document in question. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=575.42s)]
*  So has ranking Democrat Jimmy Raskin, which is how we know this whole controversy, which [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=579.36s)]
*  Republicans are touting as a massive new scandal, is apparently, wait for it, the same tired [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  Burisma conspiracy theory that Rudy Giuliani got Trump impeached over back in 2020. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=590.3s)]
*  The one that Trump Attorney General Bill Barr, of all people, determined was not worth pursuing. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=598.12s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman is a Democrat in New York who sits in the House Oversight Committee [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=605.36s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=608.46s)]
*  Congressman, you know, it's easier at the first act of mysteries, the first few episodes [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=610.28s)]
*  of a season than the latter ones. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=617.18s)]
*  We've got to tie up the loose ends. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=618.52s)]
*  You know, pointing to something and saying there's something of nefarious afoot is easier [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=620.52s)]
*  than saying what the thing is. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=624.52s)]
*  In this case, they have gotten a lot of mileage of pointing to this document as if there's [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=626.32s)]
*  some bombshell contained within. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=630.84s)]
*  What do we know about what is in there? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=633.0s)]
*  Well, my understanding is that there is information provided by an FBI source who has been credible [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=637.7600000000001s)]
*  but has no first-hand information. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=646.2800000000001s)]
*  So this FBI source is reporting information to the FBI that was provided to the source [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=648.88s)]
*  from somebody else. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=655.2s)]
*  Now, that relates to the completely debunked and false allegations about some sort of corruption [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=656.36s)]
*  related to then Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=663.76s)]
*  of Barisma. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=668.76s)]
*  Now, you will remember, Chris, because I know you studied it well, that the impeachment [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=669.76s)]
*  investigation, 17 witnesses, experts, former ambassadors, Ukraine experts, said that what [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=674.04s)]
*  Joe Biden was doing in Ukraine and urging Ukraine to remove their prosecutor general [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=681.36s)]
*  was done consistent with U.S. policy because this prosecutor general was not investigating [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=688.2s)]
*  corruption, including at countries like Barisma. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=695.6s)]
*  So what Biden was doing would actually have hurt Barisma if it were to play out. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=698.84s)]
*  This is complete garbage. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=704.32s)]
*  And if you don't have to take my word for it, because the Trump DOJ, as you just said, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=706.0s)]
*  looked into this specific document and they determined that it was not worth pursuing [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=711.28s)]
*  these allegations. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=717.16s)]
*  This is a complete nothing burger that they are trying to launder through official committees [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=719.0s)]
*  of Congress once again in order to politically harm President Biden. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=725.0s)]
*  There is nothing here. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=731.12s)]
*  There is no merit to any of this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=732.68s)]
*  And there is no reason to pursue contempt of Congress charge. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=734.8s)]
*  I just knew that I thought there was going to be a new bit. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=738.6s)]
*  Like they're talking about the document, they're talking about the document. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=741.24s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I'm kind of curious, you know, what's the allegation here? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  But it's just the Barisma stuff again? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=746.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  Like we're back? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=750.0400000000001s)]
*  That, I genuinely sort of flabbergasted and a little disappointed, just again, sort of [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  from a narrative perspective. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=756.12s)]
*  There was nothing new here. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=759.24s)]
*  To the point about the Department of Justice, again, this isn't my, again, correct me if [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=761.62s)]
*  I'm wrong in the facts here. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=765.12s)]
*  It's not just the Trump Justice Department. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=766.12s)]
*  It's William Barr, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=767.72s)]
*  In 2020, his Justice Department? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=770.28s)]
*  You'll recall early in 2020, because Rudy Giuliani kept feeding him this information [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=774.88s)]
*  that Giuliani was getting from corrupt Ukrainian officials and Russian spies, intelligence [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=781.2s)]
*  assets. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=787.48s)]
*  He was giving them to every administration agency there was, the State Department, DOJ. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=788.64s)]
*  So Bill Barr assigned the U.S. attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania to review [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=793.96s)]
*  all of this information and decide whether there should be an investigation. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=799.84s)]
*  He declined to pursue an investigation. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=805.4000000000001s)]
*  That was done all before Joe Biden became president. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=808.74s)]
*  There does seem to me some groundwork being laid on the part of members of Congress and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  Republican Party to sort of go after Garland, the current U.S. attorney general, if there [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=817.36s)]
*  are in fact charges against Donald Trump. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=825.88s)]
*  And I want to just play something Ted Cruz said. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=828.2s)]
*  This in the last few days, you got Jim Jordan writing a letter to Merrick Garland saying [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=831.88s)]
*  he's demanding a memo at the scope of Jack Smith. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=835.48s)]
*  He wants to see that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=837.92s)]
*  And here's what Ted Cruz had to say about the Department of Justice. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=838.92s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=841.52s)]
*  He has corrupted the Department of Justice. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=843.28s)]
*  He has corrupted the FBI. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=845.88s)]
*  He has corrupted the machinery of government. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=847.8s)]
*  And they're perfectly willing to use it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=849.9s)]
*  It is effectively an arm of the DNC. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=852.04s)]
*  The hypocrisy is massive. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=855.72s)]
*  And mark my words, I believe Merrick Garland will indict Donald Trump. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  He wants to indict Donald Trump because he hates Donald Trump. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=863.28s)]
*  He hates him. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=866.86s)]
*  He's angry. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=867.86s)]
*  Merrick Garland is angry that he wasn't confirmed to the Supreme Court. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=868.86s)]
*  He wants to indict him. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=872.26s)]
*  What do you think this augurs about what will happen and how congressional Republicans will [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=874.4s)]
*  try to use their power should there be an indictment? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=878.38s)]
*  Well, look, we're seeing it with this contempt motion against the FBI director, Christopher [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=882.1s)]
*  Wray, who substantially complied with the subpoena, unlike many of the House Republican members [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xqb9o8jWE&t=886.76s)]
