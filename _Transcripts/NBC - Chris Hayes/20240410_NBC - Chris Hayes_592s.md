Video Description: “As Election Day approaches, Republicans will continue to lie about their own positions because they understand how toxic they are. But make no mistake: they have already shown us and continue to show us every day what they do when they have power,” says Chris Hayes on Republicans like Donald Trump and Kari Lake trying to hide their anti-abortion views.

# ‘Desperate’ Republicans resort to lying about abortion stance after Arizona ban
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today, one day after the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160 year old law outlawing nearly all abortions, Republicans in that state's legislature threw away a chance to repeal the wildly unpopular ban. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=0.0s)]
*  Arizona Democrats, who are a slim minority, just barely in the Senate, tried to bring up legislation that would repeal the 1864 law and in some sense is calling the bluff for Republicans who said, oh, this is terrible. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=17.0s)]
*  And yet what happened Republican leaders in the state House removed the bill from the agenda. In the House, Republicans called for recess before any votes can be cast on a similar bill. Democrats quickly reproached their Republican colleagues on the floor. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=29.0s)]
*  floor. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=42.0s)]
*  The Senate is now set to be ground zero and what will be the first true [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=68.76s)]
*  nationwide abortion election in this nation's history. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=72.26s)]
*  It's the product of 50 years of anti-abortion activism by the Republican [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=76.26s)]
*  Party and conservatives. For half a century, Republicans have kind of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=79.86s)]
*  argued out of both sides of their mouths about reproductive rights. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=83.06s)]
*  This is important to understand. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  So in one side, right, they called abortion murder, your baby killers, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=87.76s)]
*  and they claim that fertilized eggs are full human persons. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=92.66000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, they claim that their real objection to the right to an [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=96.66s)]
*  abortion is as enshrined in the Supreme Court's decision Roe v. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=100.86s)]
*  Wade was that it prevented Americans from voting on the issue. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=103.46s)]
*  They said it should be left to the states into the democratic process. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=107.16s)]
*  Well, thanks to the successful efforts, the Republican anti-abortion [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=111.16s)]
*  movement and Donald Trump and his conservative majority on the Supreme [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=114.86s)]
*  Court, abortion rights have been kicked back to the states. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  The right to safe and legal reproductive care is now up in the air [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  in every state in the nation. Since the Supreme Court's decision [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=126.56s)]
*  overturning Roe, abortion rights have been explicitly on the ballot in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=129.76s)]
*  statewide referenda or initiatives in six states and in every single one. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=133.06s)]
*  The pro-abortion right side won. Even conservative states, states that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=138.56s)]
*  Donald Trump won like Kansas and Kentucky and Ohio, where Republicans [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=142.86s)]
*  pulled out every trick in the book to stop it from even getting on the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=146.56s)]
*  ballot. Arizona now will have this on the ballot in the fall. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=149.06s)]
*  It's expected to be next along with several others including Florida. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=153.16s)]
*  And of course now this year for the first time since the Supreme Court [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=156.76s)]
*  overturned Roe, we are facing a national presidential election on one [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=160.86s)]
*  side. We have the man who you know nearly single-handedly destroyed Roe [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=164.36s)]
*  v. Wade as he will be the absolute first to tell you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=170.36s)]
*  I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=174.96s)]
*  all legal scholars both sides wanted and in fact demanded be ended Roe v. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=179.26s)]
*  Wade. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=186.56s)]
*  Wade terminated and I did it and I'm proud to have done it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=190.26s)]
*  Roe v. Wade, I did something that nobody thought was possible and Roe [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=193.46s)]
*  v. Wade was terminated, was put back to the states. Point of fact there [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=197.46s)]
*  not all legal scholars on both sides wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=201.46s)]
*  That's nonsense. Now on the other side of this election, there's a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=204.76s)]
*  Democratic President Joe Biden who promises explicitly to restore Roe v. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=208.76s)]
*  Wade as the law of the land through legislation if he is able to work [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  with the Democratic House and Senate. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=217.56s)]
*  The thing about all this is and it's really wild to watch this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  I got to say I don't think I've ever quite seen something like this in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  my 20 years covering American politics. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  Republicans at least the ones with like a modicum of sense understand [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=229.26s)]
*  they are in desperate trouble on this issue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=233.66s)]
*  It is just clear as day that voters are not in line with their [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=235.86s)]
*  position on abortion. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  So they're just running around saying anything they can to anyone just [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  trying to like run away from themselves from their own position. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=245.96s)]
*  I mean Donald Trump is the prime example in a recent statement desperately [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=251.06s)]
*  trying to create some distance from the political catastrophe of his [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=255.96s)]
*  own making that he keeps bragging about. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  He said he supported leaving abortion rights up to the states. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=261.36s)]
*  Of course that includes states like Mississippi where a 13 year old who's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=264.56s)]
*  the victim of rape has to give birth to her rapist child. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=267.86s)]
*  And this comes after spent Trump spent years just flip-flopping all over [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=272.06s)]
*  the place on the issue. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=276.36s)]
*  Look I'm I'm very pro-choice. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=278.96s)]
*  I am strongly for choice and yet I hate the concept of abortion. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=282.76s)]
*  But you would not ban it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=287.06s)]
*  No I used to not be pro-life. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=288.66s)]
*  I've become pro-life. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=291.56s)]
*  I build buildings and not asking me about in my pro-choice and my pro-life. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=292.86s)]
*  What am I? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=296.76s)]
*  But yeah when I don't use the word flip I've evolved on a lot of different [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=297.86s)]
*  things. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=302.26s)]
*  I mean I'm as you know I'm pro-life. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  I have been pro-life. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=305.46s)]
*  The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment for the woman. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=306.76s)]
*  Yeah, there has to be some form. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  Again pick any position. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=313.46s)]
*  He said it at some point. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=315.56s)]
*  None of that matters. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=316.86s)]
*  It doesn't matter what he says. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=318.26s)]
*  Remember Republicans are trying to hide their true position. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=320.06s)]
*  And the ones that are trying to hide their position like Trump. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=323.66s)]
*  Those are the ones who know that they need to actually win an election. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=326.16s)]
*  But if you listen to conservatives who don't need to win votes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=329.46s)]
*  Well then they sound like this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=334.46s)]
*  If you had to travel to another state to get an abortion it's not the worst [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=337.16s)]
*  thing in the world. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=340.56s)]
*  Hopefully this is a very rare occurrence in your life once in your life. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=341.16s)]
*  Maybe it would do it buying a bus ticket to go somewhere to get it is not [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=344.36s)]
*  the worst thing in the world. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=347.86s)]
*  Come on cheer up toots. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=349.46s)]
*  Just a bus ticket. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  Just a bus ticket. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=354.46s)]
*  Just get on a bus 15 years old victim of sexual assault. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=355.26s)]
*  Get on a bus. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=358.85999999999996s)]
*  Figure it out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=360.06s)]
*  Maybe this happens once and most twice. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=360.85999999999996s)]
*  That's what they think. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=364.46s)]
*  Remember no matter what Donald Trump or anyone else says this Republican [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=367.06s)]
*  Party is devoted to completely eliminating bodily autonomy for all [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=371.26s)]
*  American women as a matter of fervent zealous belief and they will not [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=376.66s)]
*  stop until they are definitively politically defeated over and over and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  over until it's ground out of them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=388.86s)]
*  And believe me they have the tools to accomplish this robbing women of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  their full bodily autonomy at every level. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=394.56s)]
*  They have it in the judiciary in state judiciaries federal judiciary in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=396.36s)]
*  state legislatures in governor's mansions and if they win the presidency [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=400.16s)]
*  this November they will control a federal government that they can for [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=403.96s)]
*  instance order the FDA to overturn the approval of abortion medication [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=407.06s)]
*  like methametopristo take it off the shelves. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  They can revive another 19th century law still on the books which is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=413.46s)]
*  basically just like fallen into disrepute and not used called the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=418.06s)]
*  Comstock Act which and I quoted here outlaws mailing quote every article [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=421.96s)]
*  or thing designed adapted or intended for producing abortion. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=426.26s)]
*  That would mean the federal mail would shut down all the shipping of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  anything related to abortion. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=432.96s)]
*  How do you think that would work? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  What do you think that would do? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  And you may be saying well it sounds a little far-fetched to just thaw out a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=438.26s)]
*  dormant law from the 1800s to attack abortion rights, but that's exactly what [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=442.26s)]
*  they literally just did in the Arizona Supreme Court yesterday. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=446.56s)]
*  So we are now seeing the spectacle of Arizona Republicans running for office [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  twisting themselves into nuts. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  Take for instance this candidate, you know her, Carrie Lake. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=460.66s)]
*  She lost the race for governor to Katie Hobbs in 2022 though. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=465.06s)]
*  She never conceded. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=468.16s)]
*  She is now running for Senate against Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  yesterday in the wake of that disastrous Arizona Supreme Court decision. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=473.86s)]
*  She put out this statement desperately trying to run away from what she [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  knows is the wrong side of the issue. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=480.56s)]
*  She can read a poll quote. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=482.56s)]
*  I oppose today's ruling. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=484.36s)]
*  I'm calling on Katie Hobbs. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQYDikrkgc&t=485.46000000000004s)]
