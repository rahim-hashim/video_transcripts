# ‘I am furious’: Republican reps hide from their constituents as backlash mounts
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso)
*  And that is the kind of dictatorial power that's driving people to the streets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=0.0s)]
*  It's bringing new acts of defiance and more ordinary Americans saying no every day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=3.88s)]
*  Right now the focal point for that energy is Las Vegas, where tonight Senator Bernie [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=9.16s)]
*  Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined local Democrats for a rally that garnered [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=12.48s)]
*  so much interest from so many people, they had to move the whole thing to a larger venue. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=17.48s)]
*  We are here to say very loudly and clearly, no we will not accept an oligarchic form of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=23.4s)]
*  society where a handful of billionaires run the government. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=35.04s)]
*  I know what it feels like to feel left behind. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=40.08s)]
*  And I know that we don't have to live like this anymore, Las Vegas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=45.2s)]
*  We deserve better than this Las Vegas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=49.92s)]
*  And despite the chaos that surrounds us at the moment, I want you to know that we are [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  closer to that world than we think. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=60.32s)]
*  This isn't just about Republicans. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  We need a Democratic party that fights harder for us too. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=68.16s)]
*  Seems like that are replicating themselves all over the country, every day Americans [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=73.6s)]
*  on the streets showing up in force at federal buildings and state capitals to protest Trump's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=81.36s)]
*  lawless slashing of government services. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=86.08s)]
*  People are gathering at Tesla dealerships to protest Trump's unelected co-president [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=89.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and his efforts to take your federal benefits. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  Most of all, regular citizens are confronting their members of Congress. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=97.84s)]
*  Like in the state of Wyoming, a state that Trump won last year with nearly three quarters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=101.2s)]
*  of all the votes cast. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=104.56s)]
*  But the state's sole member of Congress, Republican Harriet Haggumon, faced an incredibly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  frustrated crowd. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  This person would like to know how I am going to help protect the rights of trans and non-binary [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=118.0s)]
*  I don't even know what that means. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=119.0s)]
*  Yes, I know what Doge is doing and no, I'm not scared. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=126.0s)]
*  Next question. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=133.0s)]
*  Right here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=136.0s)]
*  Here's the only thing that Doge has done, which is, it's so bizarre to me how obsessed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=139.0s)]
*  you are with federal government. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=146.0s)]
*  She is the sole Congresswoman from the state who represents them in the federal government. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=149.0s)]
*  So that's a little bit of a weird thing to say. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=169.0s)]
*  Particularly standing in the town, of course, where Matthew Shepard was murdered for being [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=171.32s)]
*  gay, vis-a-vis that first question. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=174.88s)]
*  Confrontations like that are why party leadership has told House Republicans to avoid town hall [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=177.96s)]
*  meetings with voters altogether. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=182.88s)]
*  Just ignore them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  And as a result, activists in multiple states like North Carolina and Maine and Pennsylvania [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  and Arkansas held town halls, invited their House and Senate Republicans, who no showed, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=189.36s)]
*  but the town halls went on anyway. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=194.52s)]
*  In central Pennsylvania, constituents of Republican Scott Perry blasted him for his absence, shared [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=196.84s)]
*  their own frustrations like this woman, who says her son was fired unjustly from his federal [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=202.0s)]
*  job. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=206.68s)]
*  For the Department of Education, he got axed, opened up the computer, guess what? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=207.68s)]
*  You're gone. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=214.68s)]
*  Let me tell you what he did for the Department of Education. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=215.68s)]
*  He reviewed contracts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=219.68s)]
*  He saved everybody in here thousands of tax dollars, and his evaluation was the top. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=220.68s)]
*  Then I turned on the TV the next day, and there is Trump saying they were scum, no good [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=227.68s)]
*  people, what, they got rid of him. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=234.68s)]
*  I am furious. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  Furious. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  Where is Scott Perry? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  As Republicans are avoiding their own voters at all costs, it looks like Democrats might [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  actually be capitalizing on the vacuum left for them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=258.04s)]
*  We've got, of course, Sanders and AOC attracting thousands across country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=261.04s)]
*  There's Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz going on his own speaking and listening tour. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=265.12s)]
*  We know this on the iPhone. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=268.12s)]
*  They've got that little stock app. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  $225 and dropping. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  If you own one, we're not blaming you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off, you know, and take out just telling [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=291.48s)]
*  you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=295.6s)]
*  Democrats too are finding that when they show up for town halls, they're taking a punishing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=297.8s)]
*  amount of rage from their constituents too for not doing enough. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=300.96s)]
*  Much of that anger stems from the decision last week by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=304.68s)]
*  Schumer and nine other Senate Democrats to pass Trump's funding bill and avert a government [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=308.0s)]
*  shutdown. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=313.28s)]
*  Colorado Senator Michael Bennett was not one of them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=314.28s)]
*  And last night he suggested it might be time for new Democratic leadership. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=317.06s)]
*  I do think on the leadership question, it's always better to examine whether folks are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=321.44s)]
*  in the right place. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=327.68s)]
*  And we're certainly going to have that conversation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=328.68s)]
*  It's important for people to know, you know, when it's time to to go. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=331.52s)]
*  There are a lot of people out there who are starving for real resistance, so much so that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=337.92s)]
*  even the normally quite moderate reserved Delaware Senator Chris Coons to align the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=342.28s)]
*  sand in his virtual town hall. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=347.12s)]
*  We need your voices. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=350.88s)]
*  We need your engagement. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=351.92s)]
*  We need your support. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=353.0s)]
*  And bluntly, if President Trump takes the next step and just blatantly violates, ignores [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  the orders of the court, we're going to need folks to come out to the streets. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=362.56s)]
*  It's impossible to deny what millions upon millions of Americans run right now, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  A hardened opposition against the Trump takeover unfurling day by day. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=371.44s)]
*  And for all the feelings you may gone through in recent weeks, there's no real resistance [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=380.24s)]
*  There's no real hope. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=381.24s)]
*  The vibes are shifting. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=382.24s)]
*  They really are. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=383.24s)]
*  People are speaking up and standing up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=384.24s)]
*  You are not alone. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=387.64s)]
*  There's a movement afoot to save democracy and is rapidly gaining steam. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnaihKjIso&t=388.64s)]
