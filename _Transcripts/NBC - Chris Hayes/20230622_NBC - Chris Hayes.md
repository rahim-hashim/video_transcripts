Video Description: Tim Miller says Will Hurd, Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence are among the "delusional" 2024 GOP candidates: "They’re hopeful that Donald Trump will have a heart attack or end up in prison—or there’s going to be some magic fairy that makes the Republican Party go back to what it was in 1999."

# ‘Narcissistic and delusional’ Republican Will Hurd jumps into growing 2024 race
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY)
*  Crime and homelessness growing in our cities and liberals do nothing. President Biden can't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=0.0s)]
*  solve these problems or won't. And if we nominate a lawless, selfish, failed politician like [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=7.22s)]
*  Donald Trump, who lost the House, the Senate and the White House, we all know Joe Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=13.08s)]
*  will win again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=18.46s)]
*  Former Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas announced his candidacy for presidency [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=20.46s)]
*  today, presenting himself as an alternative to the ex-president who Hurd says would lose. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=24.26s)]
*  Hurd is just the latest Republican to announce after Miami Mayor Frances Suarez declared [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=28.9s)]
*  he was running in a video that showed him literally running last week. And with Florida [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  Senator Rick Scott reportedly threatening to also join the fray, there's already a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=39.46s)]
*  lot of people running. Twelve announced so far, which is one fewer than the number of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=43.98s)]
*  Republicans who'd entered the race by this date in 2015, a number that eventually grew [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=48.92s)]
*  to 17. But this time with the ex-president holding a consistently strong lead in the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=53.0s)]
*  polls, the question is why? Why is the field getting so big? Why are so many Republicans [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=58.9s)]
*  jumping into the race? Tim Miller served as communications director for the Jeb Bush 2016 [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=64.0s)]
*  presidential campaign as well as spokesman for the RNC. David Plouffe was a campaign [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=69.6s)]
*  manager for Barack Obama in 2008, served as senior advisor to President Obama and both [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  join me now. So Tim, let me start with you. You were there the last time. So last time [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  you had Obama's term limited out, right? So you're not going to have an incumbent [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=82.56s)]
*  president take on that always, I think, invites a lot of challengers. And there was no like [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=87.08s)]
*  massive formidable behemoth in the world of, you know, on the right there was Jeb Bush [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  was sort of the early favorite. And there was a lot of reasons people thought that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=98.16s)]
*  But nothing like Trump. Like, why are so many people getting in this time around? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=102.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Jeb hadn't been in office for a decade when he started running. So he was [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=106.28s)]
*  not like that formidable. I was looking at a number of candidates. I liked Jeb the best. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=111.28s)]
*  But, you know, I was assessing the field as wide open as an operative trying to decide [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=114.76s)]
*  who to work for. So that is very much not the case this time. So I think we have two [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=118.44s)]
*  things happening in this election. One is you have a group of people that fit in the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=123.12s)]
*  grifter slash, you know, maybe if things work out, I can, you know, be in the Trump administration [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=127.36s)]
*  category. That's the Vivek Ramaswami's of the world. The mayor Suarez from Miami, I [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=133.0s)]
*  think fits that bill. And then I think you have a really large and kind of dangerous [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=140.32s)]
*  category of people that are delusional. And I think that is Mike Pence and Nikki Haley. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=145.84s)]
*  Wait a second. A politician who's delusional about their own chances and their own appearance? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=151.4s)]
*  Narcissistic and delusional. I know this is going to be hard to believe, Chris. Watch [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=157.48s)]
*  out. But, you know, this is Scott, Haley, Pence, heard, right? And I really think that, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=160.48s)]
*  you know, my understanding is, you know, from talking to people around them, is that they [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=167.56s)]
*  are in a bubble of this small minority of Republicans who agree with them. Those are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=171.48s)]
*  the people they socialize with. Those are the donors that they're dealing with. They [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=177.48s)]
*  think they deeply want and are wishing the Republican Party would go back to a candidate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=181.44s)]
*  like them. And I think they're hopeful that either Donald Trump will have a heart attack [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  or end up in prison and things might fall in their lap, or that there's going to be [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  some magic fairy that makes the Republican Party go back to what it was in 1999. And [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=196.88s)]
*  that's just not going to happen. But I think that delusion is motivating a lot of these [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  guys. Well, so it's the first one, right, that he has a heart attack or he ends up in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=204.96s)]
*  prison that I think, David, you have to explain this contradiction, right, which is that he [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  is obviously the front runner. He's polling like the front runner. No one will attack [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=214.56s)]
*  him, right? Almost no one. I mean, Christie being an exception, they're all very gentle. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=218.76s)]
*  And yet when you look at people like voting with their feet, people seem to think they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=222.88s)]
*  have a shot, right? So there's there's some way you got to explain why those two things [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=226.56s)]
*  are together. What's your explanation? Well, I agree with Tim. I mean, some are in it for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=230.44s)]
*  their future. Some are in it because they're crazy. I mean, listen, the political graveyard [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=237.44s)]
*  is filled with people whose whose supporters and friends told them what they wanted to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=241.6s)]
*  hear, not what they needed to hear until the voters ultimately were clear on that point. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=246.16s)]
*  But I do think what you have, though, is, you know, Trump's not at 60 65, right? There are [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=251.28s)]
*  enough Republicans out there open to an alternative. And when you see some of the focus groups [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=257.08s)]
*  that have been reported on the qualitative discussion, I find even more interesting than [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=261.28s)]
*  the polling, which is clearly there's an opening. Now, what's fascinating about this is, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=265.48s)]
*  listen, there's 20 lifetimes for you now in the Iowa caucuses. But once we get there, let's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=269.16s)]
*  just remember, you know, one of the reasons Trump won back in 16 is, you know, Kasich [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=274.72s)]
*  stayed in Cruz, stood, stayed in Rubio, stayed in. And so, you know, listen, if if Klobuchar [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=279.8s)]
*  and Buttigieg had waited 48 hours to drop out, you know, Bernie Sanders would have been [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=285.72s)]
*  the nominee. So a lot of this, you know, will come down to after Iowa at maybe after New [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  Hampshire. Right. You know, does this go down to one Trump alternative? But if a bunch of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  these knuckleheads stay in and split up that vote, that's where his 40 percent looks more [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=303.36s)]
*  formidable. But I think what the people who are serious about this, and I agree with him, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  it's not many, but the people who are serious about it, they're right about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=312.16s)]
*  There's an opening here. Even if Trump doesn't emulate, self-immolate even more, there's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=316.04s)]
*  clearly if you can piece this together, there's enough Republican primary voters out there [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=321.72s)]
*  open to someone else. Now, the fact that they're open to someone else and closing the sale, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=326.68s)]
*  of course, are two very, very distinct things. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=331.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we should say the Emerson polling between April and June shows a little bit of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=333.48s)]
*  movement in the right direction. Right. If you're if you're someone who is a Republican, who [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=337.2s)]
*  doesn't want Trump to be the nominee, you know, goes from 69 to 59 to Santas picks up a few [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=341.96s)]
*  points. There's some other reasons that this is about whether a third party candidate would [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=346.08s)]
*  sort of spoil that. This is a sort of April to June comparison. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=353.4s)]
*  But, you know, so there's there's reason to think there's an opening here. I completely agree. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=357.04s)]
*  And I do think, Tim, like there is this strange waiting for the meteor feeling to the whole [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  field, right, which is just like, look, people like him, you kind of alienate all the people [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=366.48s)]
*  who are trying to persuade if you criticize him, because then you're a lib. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  But like, I don't know, maybe like when we get to the fifth indictment or actually like [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=376.6s)]
*  sitting in a courtroom, you know, people this'll I mean, that really is what it feels like to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=382.6s)]
*  me. Well, there's a there's a kind of waiting for media for eight years, like those of them [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=387.2s)]
*  that didn't jump like me, Chris. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=392.32s)]
*  So it's kind of like eventually I'm going to be right, you know, eventually some everybody [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=393.72s)]
*  dies. Right. So I think, you know, they're they're pot committed, you know, so there's that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=396.88s)]
*  element to it. Here's the thing, though, and I agree with David in general, that there's an [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=402.56s)]
*  opening for somebody. But the types of Republicans in these focus groups that we do with the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=406.0s)]
*  bulwark that are open to someone else want someone like Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=410.88s)]
*  They like Trump. You know, so there isn't an opening for a lot of the people that have gotten [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=413.8s)]
*  in. I think that's the important thing to understand. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=418.56s)]
*  Just the one poll I saw that was relevant in a head to head, the status is at thirty three. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=420.68s)]
*  Tim Scott is at twenty three. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=425.4s)]
*  And I think that gap tells you a lot. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=427.36s)]
*  Right. If you're a Tim Scott, you've got a really long way to go. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=429.6s)]
*  And I don't see the opening for people like that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=433.08s)]
*  Yeah. Quickly, David, on on on Trump, I mean, this is the last thing here is the Santas, right, who [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=436.28s)]
*  has modeled himself as like, you know, if you like Trump, how about me? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=441.96s)]
*  But I'm younger and I can I can win. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=445.28s)]
*  I also think it speaks to perceptions of his weakness that you're seeing all these people get in. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, no question. I mean, and that is maybe it's not fatal. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=453.0s)]
*  We'll see. But certainly it's a it's a critical error, which is that he has now created oxygen for a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=456.55999999999995s)]
*  bunch of people because I still think on paper he is by far the most likely person that Trump's going [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=462.96s)]
*  to get the throne to do it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  But he's been been close to God awful to date. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=471.76s)]
*  But it's not even July 4th. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=476.2s)]
*  OK, I mean, there is so much time left. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=479.76s)]
*  We've got to put him together. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=482.28s)]
*  He does seem to be putting together something decent. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  Can I will see. So I think you're right. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=486.96s)]
*  I mean, and all these candidates getting in to Santas has to look in the mirror and say the reason this field is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=489.76s)]
*  getting more crowded, the reason we're going to have debates now over two nights is because I have been [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=495.16s)]
*  all just just saying that sentence gave me a little flash of PTSD. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=502.2s)]
*  Tim Miller and David Plot, thank you very much. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsahZGHqQSY&t=506.24s)]
