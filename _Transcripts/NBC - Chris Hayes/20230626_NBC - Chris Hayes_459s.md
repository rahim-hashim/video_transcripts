Video Description: “He looks fundamentally weakened. This is a face-saving culture, you need to play the part of the strongman if that’s the one you’ve chosen,” says Alexander Vindman. “There was an armed insurrection, and so far nobody had been held accountable. That does not make Putin look strong.”

# Vindman: Putin looks ‘fundamentally weakened’ after Wagner rebellion
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI)
*  Joining me now is the retired United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=0.0s)]
*  former Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=4.44s)]
*  He was born here in Kiev when it was part of the former Soviet Union. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=7.76s)]
*  And really what happened this weekend, Colonel, is the biggest thing that's happened since [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=11.6s)]
*  the fall of the Soviet Union. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=15.32s)]
*  In the entire time Vladimir Putin's been president of Russia and prime minister of Russia, something [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=16.6s)]
*  like this has not happened. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=20.92s)]
*  I think the closest analog maybe might be the 1917 communist revolution where you had [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=22.12s)]
*  after years of war, the troops left the battlefield and then took part in a rebellion that overthrew [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=27.56s)]
*  the Tsar and ushered in the communist party after a long period of instability. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=33.08s)]
*  This war has gone so terribly bad for Russia that we already have armed forces, the mercenaries, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=38.84s)]
*  marching against at least the military establishment, if not the authorities at large. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=45.24s)]
*  I think we know little, frankly, about what's going on, massive speculation about the deal [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=51.32s)]
*  that was struck, where pergosian is. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=56.28s)]
*  What we do know is this is fundamentally weakened Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=58.720000000000006s)]
*  You are actually an expert on this stuff. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=61.84s)]
*  This is what you did for the National Security Council. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  Can you give me some sense of what Belarus's role is, what Lukashenko's role is, how it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=66.16s)]
*  would be likely or possible that he was negotiating a deal between these two guys? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=72.0s)]
*  Belarus is essentially a partner with Russia in this war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=76.68s)]
*  Belarus is a country that they have plans to unite with Russia in the next few years. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=79.5s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=84.28s)]
*  What's the Belarus part of this? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=85.36s)]
*  The Belarus part of this is likely Lukashenko being ushered in to play the part of a trusted [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=86.84s)]
*  advisor. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=92.76s)]
*  I think there's something to be said about Putin not negotiating directly with pergosian [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=93.76s)]
*  that would make him look too fundamentally weak. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=97.76s)]
*  Lukashenko could be acting as a trusted agent from one standpoint. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=100.76s)]
*  He may be able to provide at least the facade of security for pergosian if pergosian goes [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=105.94s)]
*  there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=111.08s)]
*  But I don't think it's that meaningful. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=112.08s)]
*  As many know that follow this region, Lukashenko is frankly beholden to Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=113.88s)]
*  If Putin wanted Lukashenko to eliminate pergosian, pergosian would be gone. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=120.84s)]
*  So I think the fact is there's not a lot of clarity as to what deal, what guarantees this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=125.92s)]
*  pergosian have in going to Belarus. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=134.68s)]
*  He doesn't really have anything. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=136.8s)]
*  So let's go to the big question. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=138.0s)]
*  Where is Russia in this whole thing right now? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=139.48s)]
*  Where is Russia today? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=141.48s)]
*  Is it weaker? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=142.88s)]
*  Is Vladimir Putin weaker? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=143.88s)]
*  And is he going to try and prove to the world and to Russia and to Ukraine that he's not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=144.88s)]
*  weaker? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=149.12s)]
*  I think he might need to try to demonstrate strength. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  I think that was part of the speech that we saw earlier today, him demonstrating that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=152.64s)]
*  he's in charge, him demonstrating that he's still the head of state. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=156.2s)]
*  In reality, if you look at it from world leaders across the world, China thinks that Putin [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=159.5s)]
*  might not have legs in the future. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=164.48s)]
*  the world in Africa that believe that Putin was a guarantor for an alternative system, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=167.76s)]
*  something different than the United States. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=175.28s)]
*  And the Western-led liberal order now have to have serious doubts as to whether Putin [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  really does have that staying power. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=181.44s)]
*  I think from a basic strongman standpoint, he looks fundamentally weakened. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=183.12s)]
*  This is a face-saving culture. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=189.44s)]
*  You need to play the part of the strongman if that's the part that you've put on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=191.6s)]
*  That's the one you've chosen. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=195.48s)]
*  That's the part you've chosen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  And what he's experienced is over the course of several days, an armed insurrection that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=197.88s)]
*  basically took over a large city, marched all the way through close to Moscow, unopposed, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  in fact, in parts of the country welcomed, and in the meantime, knocking down seven aircraft, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  six helicopters, one plane. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  And with what costs? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=216.66s)]
*  There was an armed insurrection, and so far nobody's been held accountable. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=217.66s)]
*  That does not make Putin look strong. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  However, there are a whole lot of people who think Vladimir Putin's not the right guy to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=223.6s)]
*  run Russia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=228.0s)]
*  They are pro-democracy activists. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=229.0s)]
*  Many of them are in jail, including Navalny and Vladimir Karamursa. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=230.64s)]
*  This doesn't help their cause. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=236.56s)]
*  This doesn't help. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=238.12s)]
*  This is two right-wing, ultra-nationalist guys out-thugging each other. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=239.12s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=243.8s)]
*  There's a Russian word for this, serezborka. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=245.2s)]
*  Basically it's like a pissing contest, if I could say that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=248.72s)]
*  I think the fact is that what you have is, Pergosian was under enormous pressure. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=252.32s)]
*  He was about to lose his fiefdom. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=257.44s)]
*  He was about to lose Wagner. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=259.2s)]
*  He was about to be subordinated to Moscow. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=260.2s)]
*  He launched— [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=262.52s)]
*  They were going to take over. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=263.52s)]
*  The military was going to basically take over Wagner. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=264.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=265.52s)]
*  And what he did was he launched a demonstration. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=266.52s)]
*  This was supposed to be a demonstration, but he achieved massive success, catastrophic [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=268.24s)]
*  success, success that he didn't know what to do with. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  He was not looking to do an armed insurrection to topple Putin. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=275.4s)]
*  If anything, he was going to play the part of a faithful lieutenant demonstrating that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=279.32s)]
*  Putin is surrounded by underlings that are undermining him. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=283.56s)]
*  He wanted those folks to be removed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=286.88s)]
*  He found himself in a position where he took over a city, was marching on Moscow, largely [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=289.24s)]
*  unopposed and in fact welcomed, and he wasn't ready to go there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=292.92s)]
*  I think at this point, Pergosian really probably doesn't have that many legs. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=296.56s)]
*  He's not going to be able to go back to his own folks in Wagner. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Few of them will be—will trust him a second time, a go-around where there's a higher [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=303.32s)]
*  degree for violence. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=306.96s)]
*  This is no longer a demonstration. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=308.42s)]
*  This would be probably something closer to an armed insurrection leading into a coup. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think the fact is where this goes is a delicate balance. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=315.02000000000004s)]
*  Does Putin push too far where Wagner has to retaliate with force? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=319.7s)]
*  Does Pergosian not yield enough or does he push too far? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=324.64s)]
*  I think we're just probably a match could ignite this situation in a huge way. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=328.66s)]
*  And of course, Ukrainians, in some cases, taking solace in the fact that there's problems [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=336.06s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=342.26s)]
*  What's your sense of how this affects this war with Ukraine right now, where the Ukrainians [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=343.26s)]
*  are making some progress in their counteroffensive? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=346.84s)]
*  I think they're making reasonably good progress. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=349.88s)]
*  I'm a little bit concerned that this shouldn't turn into a war of attrition because that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=352.18s)]
*  doesn't preserve Ukraine's combat power to be able to achieve those meaningful objectives [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=357.82s)]
*  that bring this war to a close. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=362.94s)]
*  But they are making some progress. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=365.0s)]
*  What we see is, frankly, a weaker Russia than we thought was there days ago, mainly because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=366.32s)]
*  there's infighting amongst the elites. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=373.16s)]
*  I think this is a template for others to potentially see that Putin is weaker and might need to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=375.42s)]
*  ... is no longer really in firm control of the country. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=381.36s)]
*  We might see other factions, other security forces start to wonder if Putin is the person [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=385.34s)]
*  to lead this country going forward. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=390.3s)]
*  In the meantime, Ukraine is going to take advantage of this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  At the basic level, what we have is a weakening of the military command and control. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  It's unclear whether Shoigu has a staying power or whether Grasimov has a staying power. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=400.64s)]
*  These folks are directly involved in this war effort. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  The ability to be able to control from the big picture, the theater level, what's going [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=407.8s)]
*  on on the ground, has been undermined. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=412.62s)]
*  I think that's going to be opening up a little bit of a door for Ukraine to make some additional [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=414.94s)]
*  gains. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=419.34s)]
*  Early reporting that they've actually crossed the Dnieper, a bridge that's particularly [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=420.41999999999996s)]
*  interesting and important because it's a place where the Russians had very little force, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=426.09999999999997s)]
*  and they're testing Russia's vulnerabilities. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=429.97999999999996s)]
*  We're likely to see over the course of the coming weeks major thrusts, not these probing [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=431.85999999999996s)]
*  attacks but major thrusts by the Ukrainian military. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwLOukXgedI&t=436.59999999999997s)]
