# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI)
*  Michigan, which is the state the president just gave that speech in, is of course a state [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=0.0s)]
*  that he won four years ago. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=3.94s)]
*  It is clearly a must win again in November to have a chance of defeating Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=5.22s)]
*  And the president made clear that that is his plan tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=10.22s)]
*  There's a lot of speculation lately. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=13.38s)]
*  What's Joe Biden going to do? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=17.38s)]
*  Is he going to stay in the race? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=18.38s)]
*  Is he going to drop out? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=19.38s)]
*  Where's my answer? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=20.38s)]
*  I am running and we're going to win. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=21.38s)]
*  I'm not going to change that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=22.38s)]
*  I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=23.38s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=24.38s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=25.38s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=26.38s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=27.38s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=28.38s)]
*  I'm the Democratic Party, the only Democrat or Republican that has beaten Donald Trump [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  ever. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=33.26s)]
*  And I'm going to beat him again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=34.26s)]
*  I know him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=35.26s)]
*  Donald Trump is a loser. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=36.26s)]
*  That speech happening this evening on a very packed day for the president earlier in the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=41.26s)]
*  day on a tense call with congressional Democrats. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=51.8s)]
*  He said, I'm not going, I'm going to go out, let people touch me, poke me, ask me questions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=53.8s)]
*  Today, as he got back into retail politics and there were flashes of Joe Biden, the veteran [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  campaigner. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=63.42s)]
*  My dad used to say, Joey, your job is about a lot more than a paycheck. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=64.42s)]
*  It's about your dignity. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=69.34s)]
*  It's about respect. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=70.34s)]
*  It's about being a look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be OK and mean [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=71.34s)]
*  it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=74.58s)]
*  And that's what that's what it's all about. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=75.58s)]
*  Part of the case that the president's been making to voters as he did last night in that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=78.58s)]
*  press conference is is pretty straightforward. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=81.94s)]
*  It goes like this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=84.14s)]
*  Let's look at how the American economy has roared back since he took the reins during [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  the aftermath of covid, a recession and a supply crisis. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=90.42s)]
*  We made so much progress. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=94.9s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=96.94s)]
*  Think about what we are economically relative to the rest of the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=98.3s)]
*  Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=102.22s)]
*  We created over 800000 manufacturing jobs, one point five million. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  I mean, so things are moving. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=110.34s)]
*  He's not wrong. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=113.98s)]
*  For months, experts have been calling the U.S. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=114.98s)]
*  economy. These are not partisan folks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  These are just people that analyze this stuff for a living, calling U.S. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=118.58s)]
*  economy the envy of the world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=121.34s)]
*  It's grown at a far faster rate than any other large developed economy on Earth. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=122.78s)]
*  In fact, the World Bank last month not only said the Biden era American economy was the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=127.98s)]
*  world's strongest, which it is, it also concluded that the entire global economy is in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=132.18s)]
*  better shape because of the strength of the American recovery. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=136.82s)]
*  There's huge spillover effects because the U.S. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=139.98s)]
*  has been a kind of tent pole for global post covid recovery. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=142.7s)]
*  When you consider where we stood in 2020, Biden's tenure has been the most successful [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  macroeconomic stewardship of any president in my lifetime. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  And many of those economic successes have come through in headlines in just the past [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=155.26s)]
*  three weeks, though, of course, you may have missed them for some reason. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=158.62s)]
*  Just yesterday, new government data showed that inflation was cooling beyond almost all [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=162.06s)]
*  economists' expectations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=166.34s)]
*  Prices on everything from cars to groceries are down. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=168.06s)]
*  Rent, crucially, which has been a real source of pain for people and growing really quickly, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=171.22s)]
*  is finally stabilizing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  Rent is finally stale. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=178.5s)]
*  For the first time in four years, overall prices are down last month on a month to month [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=179.9s)]
*  basis, not rising at its lower clip, but actually declining. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=184.86s)]
*  The Fed now might even cut interest rates before the election. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=188.74s)]
*  A few days earlier, a study highlighted by The New York Times concluded that America's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=192.38000000000002s)]
*  so-called left behind counties, the once great manufacturing centers and other distressed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  places that struggled mightily at the start of the century, have staged a remarkable [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  comeback. In the last three years, they added jobs and new businesses at their fastest [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=205.38s)]
*  pace since Bill Clinton was president. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=209.78s)]
*  So the economic growth is not just helping big cities, it's not just helping urban [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=212.62s)]
*  professionals in regions like Bay County, Michigan, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=215.78s)]
*  where President Biden was born. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  The job markets are strong. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=221.94s)]
*  Wages are up in real terms. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=223.5s)]
*  And today, markets rally with all three major stock indexes closing near their all time [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  highs. And much of this is thanks to Joe Biden, the president, and his economic policy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=230.38s)]
*  agenda. A man who entered office facing a really difficult situation and a whole bunch [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  of hard choices. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=241.61999999999998s)]
*  The Biden White House has not just addressed cyclical concerns like the high unemployment [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  when they took over during Covid and the subsequent inflation, it's actually moved [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=247.66s)]
*  America away from the worst excesses of the economic model that dominated for decades, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=251.9s)]
*  a model that was based on low wage work, huge outsourcing and gutting the American [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  manufacturing base. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=264.06s)]
*  Biden has improved on all of those. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=266.14s)]
*  Inequality has shrunk. Wages at the bottom are up the most. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=267.66s)]
*  He's also been building towards a green transition, heavy industry. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=270.38s)]
*  All of this is a record, like I said, it's the best economic management of any president [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=274.38s)]
*  in my lifetime. It's a record to just to be proud of. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=277.98s)]
*  And it has been an enduring obsession of mine and the show that the Biden presidency has [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=281.65999999999997s)]
*  delivered all of this and his approval rating hovers around 37 percent. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=286.3s)]
*  That's not a good number. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=291.5s)]
*  That's on par with Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, who both lost their reelection bids, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  but crucially who are presiding over very weak economies. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  They had nowhere near as strong a record on the merits to run on as Biden does. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=300.86s)]
*  And so what's the deal? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=307.18s)]
*  There's a lot of things we've talked about on the show. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=308.38s)]
*  There is one seemingly straightforward explanation, which is that a lot of people, roughly [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=310.38s)]
*  two thirds of voters in recent polls think that Biden is too old to serve another term as [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  president that acts as a kind of anchor. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=317.82s)]
*  And that perception colors everything. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=320.78s)]
*  And it explains in some ways why so many Democrats are so worried about Biden at the top of the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  ticket. They basically reason that if you have this kind of record as a president and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=327.5s)]
*  you're still down the polls, is there any hope? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=332.62s)]
*  Is there any hope? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=336.38s)]
*  And the irony, of course, is that this exact same effect set of facts also explains Biden's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=338.06s)]
*  perspective, where he says, look, I have a unique set of skills I brought to bear on [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=343.58s)]
*  the presidency. 50 years of experience. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=349.34s)]
*  I've accomplished a whole bunch of things that no one said we could get done that would [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=352.14s)]
*  have been difficult for anyone else to accomplish by dint of the fact that I've literally been [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=355.74s)]
*  doing it for 50 years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=359.34s)]
*  In fact, he said as much in that press conference last night. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=361.1s)]
*  And what I realized was my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=363.74s)]
*  on how to deal with the Congress to get things done. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=372.54s)]
*  We got more major legislation passed that no one thought would happen. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=376.62s)]
*  And I want to finish it to get that finished. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  So that is the conundrum in a nutshell. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=385.02s)]
*  At least it's the challenge, if nothing else. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=386.86s)]
*  The president has been good at governing, at getting legislation done on economic [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=389.9s)]
*  management and stewardship and leadership. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=394.06s)]
*  In part, I think because he has more experience than anyone else. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=396.94s)]
*  And but also his advanced age is also his biggest political liability. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=400.46s)]
*  Even against an opponent who's just slightly younger, has 34 felony convictions, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=405.02s)]
*  and tried to pull off a violent coup to stay in office and end the constitutional republic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=409.58s)]
*  That was the president of the United States. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=417.02s)]
*  Joseph Robinette Biden holding a very spirited campaign rally in Detroit, Michigan tonight. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=418.86s)]
*  We just took that live, clocking in around 30 minutes before an exuberant crowd. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=425.26s)]
*  I am Chris Hayes here in New York. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=430.7s)]
*  I'm joined by my colleague, Joy Reid, of course, the host of the readout just before me. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=433.18s)]
*  And Joy, I want to first get my first read on this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=439.5s)]
*  Again, I think we've been honest throughout about the various performances [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=443.26s)]
*  we've seen from this president, from the debate, the Stephanopoulos interview, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=448.3s)]
*  to the press conference. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  That was by far, I think, the best performance he's given us in the State of the Union. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  And looked like that's the Joe Biden that has been a very successful politician in one in 2020. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=459.5s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=467.18s)]
*  It was the best performance we've seen, actually, since the Waffle House, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=468.38s)]
*  a half an hour after that disastrous debate. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=472.7s)]
*  The reason I throw the Waffle House in there is that a half an hour after that performance, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=476.38s)]
*  he walked into a Waffle House in Atlanta and came alive. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=482.21999999999997s)]
*  You know why? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=485.82s)]
*  Because there were people in there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=486.7s)]
*  Whoever on the Biden staff made the deal to have him do a debate with no crowd [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=488.62s)]
*  and no people to respond and to bounce off of, that person should reevaluate their entire career. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=495.65999999999997s)]
*  Because Joe Biden, in all of my observations, I have seen him, witnessed him, particularly [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  in a black church, he comes alive. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=507.97999999999996s)]
*  In front of a crowd, he comes alive. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=509.9s)]
*  It is people that make Joe Biden come alive. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=511.82s)]
*  That was a demonstration of it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=514.62s)]
*  Whatever hoarse voice he even had yesterday in front of the press when he did that, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=516.22s)]
*  really well done, brilliantly done. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=519.98s)]
*  Press conference, a whole 49 minutes of policy talk, did a great job. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=522.3s)]
*  A couple of Biden gaffs, but that's Biden. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=526.22s)]
*  You know, he's just Biden. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=528.14s)]
*  But in this crowd, I don't know if it was Pastor Cindy Rudolph prayed over him before he started [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=529.42s)]
*  or he just had the right oatmeal this morning with the right ingredients. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  But that Joe Biden is the Joe Biden you get when there are people, when there is a crowd, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=539.02s)]
*  when he can bounce off of the energy of people. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=543.42s)]
*  That is what he actually needs in order to come alive. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=545.9799999999999s)]
*  And so I think what we've learned is that two things actually help Biden thrive. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=548.78s)]
*  People, a crowd, that energy, but also conflict. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  Everyone has come at this man. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=558.78s)]
*  The Congressional caucus, not the black caucus, but everybody else, the more the white Democrats [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  have come at him, the donors have come at him and said, we're taking your $90 million. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=566.6999999999999s)]
*  You won't even pay until you go away. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=569.74s)]
*  The Hollywood crowd have come at him and said, unless you go, we're going to stop helping you. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=572.38s)]
*  We're not even going to help this campaign. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=575.98s)]
*  All of what you would call the elite came at Joe Biden. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=578.06s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=580.54s)]
*  Joe Biden woke up. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=581.74s)]
*  The conflict and the understandable, you know, stress that you've seen among Democrats, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=583.74s)]
*  but the really kind of ridiculous public war of Democrats against their own president [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=590.14s)]
*  seems to have been the thing that he needed to catch fire. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=597.66s)]
*  And just very quickly, the things that he did tonight that I thought were very smart, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=600.54s)]
*  laying out his first hundred days in which he talked about restoring Roe v. Wade, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=604.4599999999999s)]
*  talked about the Voting Rights Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=609.1s)]
*  something he wasn't able to get done without a Democratic Senate, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=612.7s)]
*  making the child tax credit permanent, which is going to help against poverty. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=615.4200000000001s)]
*  He touted the fact that he took something very important, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=618.94s)]
*  taking credit debt off of your credit report, game changing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  He said he's going to expand that, get rid of medical debt, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=625.58s)]
*  raising the federal minimum wage, a huge and important thing [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=629.74s)]
*  that civil rights leaders like Bishop William Barber have been calling on him to do. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=633.1s)]
*  So he came out and he gave an agenda. I thought that was important. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=636.94s)]
*  And then also going on the attack against Trump. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=640.62s)]
*  He called Trump Putin's puppy. He called him a convicted criminal. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=643.34s)]
*  He quoted the judge and saying not just sexual assault, he raped E. Jean Carroll. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=647.34s)]
*  He said he went bankrupt trying to run a casino, didn't know you could do that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=652.3800000000001s)]
*  Then when he got protested, he responded by allowing the protest to happen, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=656.3800000000001s)]
*  sobering up, taking a moment and then touting his deal to end the war between Hamas and the Israelis. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=661.26s)]
*  This was well done. I can't say anything other than that's the Joe Biden, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=669.0999999999999s)]
*  who I think Democrats who might be nervous needed to see. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=672.9399999999999s)]
*  And for Democrats who doubted him, that was the come at me bro Joe Biden. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=675.9s)]
*  He ain't going nowhere. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=679.7399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't well, we'll see. I mean, the future remains unwritten. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=682.06s)]
*  I think he is dead set on not going anywhere. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=685.02s)]
*  No. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=688.54s)]
*  He was to me that that was also the most camp, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=688.86s)]
*  comprehensive thesis of the campaign. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=693.82s)]
*  Like we haven't since the State of the Union. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=697.1800000000001s)]
*  That was like it's like, what's the campaign? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=698.86s)]
*  It's like, that's the campaign. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=700.86s)]
*  That speech is the campaign. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=701.82s)]
*  Yeah, 30 minutes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=702.86s)]
*  It's Joe Biden is that it is, you know, Joe Biden has a has a strong record. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=703.9s)]
*  Joe Biden has a vision for the future. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=709.74s)]
*  You're pointing about the next 100 days. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=711.5s)]
*  And Donald Trump is a menace. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=714.14s)]
*  And all of that, the contrast, Donald Trump is a menace sort of just completely unloading on the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=716.54s)]
*  guy in every possible way. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=721.98s)]
*  January 6th sexual assault. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=723.74s)]
*  And then here's what I've done. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=726.2199999999999s)]
*  And here's what I'm going to do. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=727.66s)]
*  Those three pillars, the guys in menace. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=728.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=730.78s)]
*  Here's what we've done. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=731.1s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=732.3s)]
*  Here's what our shared values are. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=733.3399999999999s)]
*  That is a comprehensive 30 minutes. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=734.86s)]
*  That's the campaign. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=736.9399999999999s)]
*  That's the first time I think. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=737.8199999999999s)]
*  And we've seen ads, we've seen events. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=739.3399999999999s)]
*  It's not like they're having to, but that is the like the tight 30. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=741.3399999999999s)]
*  As they would say in stand up, like that's the that is the that's the campaign right there. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=745.02s)]
*  I think we sort of saw for the first time today. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=750.62s)]
*  It is. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=754.22s)]
*  And I think it was important also because he's in Detroit and this is a must win state. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=754.62s)]
*  It has to happen, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=758.9399999999999s)]
*  You saw that multiracial crowd behind him. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=759.9s)]
*  That is the demographics that have to come out, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=761.98s)]
*  It has been African Americans has been black folks who have been solidly with Joe Biden [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=764.22s)]
*  all throughout these whole two weeks of Sturm and Drong inside of the party. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=768.22s)]
*  But I think that what he understood tonight, as you've said, is that it's not just about [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=771.58s)]
*  bragging about the past. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=776.0600000000001s)]
*  It is about whether or not this is somebody who can manage the future because this presidential [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=777.58s)]
*  campaign is partly about what he's accomplished, but it's partly about whether he can handle [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  moving forward, moving the the ball forward, moving the ball down the field in a football [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=786.14s)]
*  analogy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=790.94s)]
*  What he did tonight is say here are my plays. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=791.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and telegraph. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=794.14s)]
*  These are the plays. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=795.4200000000001s)]
*  If you put me back on, put me in coach, put me back in. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=796.22s)]
*  This is what I'm going to do for you. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=799.74s)]
*  These are my deliverables. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=801.66s)]
*  And I think it was important to have those deliverables be about the working class, being [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=803.0999999999999s)]
*  about the people that he is trying to keep on side and get on side. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=808.2199999999999s)]
*  It is those union workers. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=813.02s)]
*  It is those working class people of color and white Americans. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=814.4599999999999s)]
*  It's people who are saying I can't afford my rent. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=817.74s)]
*  He said they're going to go after these high rents that he then points out who the villain [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=820.4599999999999s)]
*  is. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=825.5799999999999s)]
*  These, you know, hedge funds, et cetera, that are buying up all that property says we're [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=826.14s)]
*  going to do that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=829.66s)]
*  We're going to cap rent increases. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=830.22s)]
*  Huge. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=832.38s)]
*  It's a huge problem, particularly among younger voters who are stressed in terms of their [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=832.9399999999999s)]

*  Bye. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=885.98s)]
*  The aftermath of the first presidential debate and calls from some Democrats for President [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=886.22s)]
*  Biden to step aside, we've seen heightened focus on his potential replacement, Vice President [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=891.74s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=895.58s)]
*  Last night, the president himself highlighted her readiness for the job. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=896.86s)]
*  I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=901.1800000000001s)]
*  From the very beginning, I made no bones about that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=904.86s)]
*  She is qualified to be president. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=908.5400000000001s)]
*  That's why I picked her. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=910.7s)]
*  And that comes amid new polling, finding Harris running as well, or in some cases better than [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=911.6600000000001s)]
*  Biden, in a head-to-head matchup with Donald Trump. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=916.94s)]
*  In one of those surveys out this week, Harris leads Trump 49 to 46 while Biden is behind [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=919.34s)]
*  46 to 47, although we should note that's all right around the margin of error. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=923.74s)]
*  Donald Trump seems to believe that Harris could be a real threat. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=928.38s)]
*  The New York Times reports his team is planning to go after her, the Republican convention [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=930.94s)]
*  next week, working more attacks into the speeches and messaging. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=934.94s)]
*  Trump's conservative allies are also ramping up their attacks on the first female vice [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=938.9399999999999s)]
*  president, a woman of Indian and Jamaican descent. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=942.62s)]
*  And the rhetoric is, well, it's gross and getting worse. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=945.5799999999999s)]
*  It is also revealing their unified project. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=949.26s)]
*  Beyond destroying Kamala Harris, the conservative movement increasingly is committed to purging [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=951.5s)]
*  women, minorities, particularly black folks, from positions of power in American life. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=957.0999999999999s)]
*  And they've been hiding that real agenda to essentially resegregate the highest bases [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=963.5s)]
*  of American life behind a campaign against DEI diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=967.74s)]
*  This was all kind of tipped off in a New York Post that recently ran this opinion base [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=974.22s)]
*  by longtime Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=978.7s)]
*  America soon may be subjected to the country's first DEI president. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=982.3s)]
*  Going on a complaint about the sitting vice president, quote, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=987.1s)]
*  maybe the most impressively factuous politician in America may become the leader of the free [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=989.1800000000001s)]
*  world because the Democratic Party is unable to break its DEI stranglehold. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=993.5s)]
*  In front of the cameras, the obvious racism has been even worse. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=999.58s)]
*  Do these donors really think that Kamala Harris is going to do better in Wisconsin, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1004.06s)]
*  Michigan and Pennsylvania than Joe Biden would? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1007.5s)]
*  I mean, that's because it can't be anybody else, right? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1009.34s)]
*  Rob, you're being logical. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1012.06s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1013.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1014.38s)]
*  She's a DEI hire, right? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1014.94s)]
*  She's a woman. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1017.1s)]
*  She's colored. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1018.3s)]
*  Therefore, she's got to be good. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1019.1s)]
*  They are a box where they've got to choose between a mentally incompetent president [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1020.62s)]
*  and a DEI vice president. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1024.38s)]
*  If they can drag him across the finish line and install Kamala, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1026.3s)]
*  we have a DEI presidency that they can celebrate for the rest of the administration. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1030.06s)]
*  Bottom line here is that it's going to go to Kamala, if anybody, because she was a DEI hire. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1034.46s)]
*  John, you shouldn't talk like that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1040.06s)]
*  It makes you sound like a racist. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1041.1s)]
*  Don't talk like that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1042.54s)]
*  But can I just say one thing about the first clip we played there is that one of the guests [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1044.62s)]
*  was a bald white dude who became attorney general of the US [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1048.14s)]
*  because Donald Trump liked him and his past involved selling toilets for largely endowed men, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1052.22s)]
*  I think. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1058.22s)]
*  That was his qualification. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1058.6200000000001s)]
*  That guy, yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1059.66s)]
*  That's the guy who's super qualified. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1060.46s)]
*  That's a super qualified dude who became attorney general [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1062.7s)]
*  talking about the poor qualifications of Kamala Harris. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1065.3400000000001s)]
*  Now, to be clear, the anti-DEI movement is the right-wing agenda. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1068.3000000000002s)]
*  It is literally written into their blueprint for a second Trump term, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1073.1000000000001s)]
*  Project 2025. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1076.46s)]
*  Reading from it, they plan to, quote, reverse the DEI revolution, saying, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1078.46s)]
*  the next administration should eliminate every one of these wrongful and burdensome [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1081.74s)]
*  ideological projects. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1085.98s)]
*  And this conservative crusade is coming for all sorts of spaces in American life. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1087.98s)]
*  They just sued a black hedge fund. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1091.66s)]
*  They're coming for higher education. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1093.58s)]
*  You can see it in action. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1095.1000000000001s)]
*  So last week, a group led by notorious right-wing lawyer, former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1096.78s)]
*  Mitchell, brought a lawsuit in federal court against Northwestern University Law School for [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1102.86s)]
*  discriminating against white men. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1107.34s)]
*  The complaint calls faculty hiring at American universities a cesspool of corruption and [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1109.82s)]
*  lawlessness. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1114.9399999999998s)]
*  It goes on to allege that left-wing faculty and administrators are openly discriminating [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1116.06s)]
*  on account of race and sex when appointing professors. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1120.1399999999999s)]
*  Quote, they do this by hiring women and racial minorities with mediocre and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1123.4199999999998s)]
*  undistinguished records over white men who have better credentials, better scholarship, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1127.4199999999998s)]
*  and better teaching ability. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1131.4199999999998s)]
*  And in the complaint, they just go after a number of scholars of color on the law school [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1133.4199999999998s)]
*  faculty, like by name, dragging them. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1138.9399999999998s)]
*  Now, the fact is Northwestern University Law School, one of the best law schools in the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1142.54s)]
*  nation, hires highly distinguished and experienced women and minorities who have clerked for [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1145.4199999999998s)]
*  federal and even Supreme Court justice, authored hundreds of publications, won awards for their [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1149.6599999999999s)]
*  scholarship and their teaching. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1154.3s)]
*  What the complaint is really saying is this. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1155.6599999999999s)]
*  Anyone who's not a white man is suspect by definition and indeed inferior by definition. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1158.06s)]
*  What the complaint is saying, what this ideological project is saying is we want them out of these [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1163.6599999999999s)]
*  spaces. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1169.02s)]
*  And they are already bringing the same racist logic to bear on the former California Attorney [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1171.1s)]
*  General and United States Senator who has served for three years as the Vice President [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1175.34s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1179.1s)]
*  The most rabid campaigners against DEI who throw it around as a slur are devoted to a [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1181.02s)]
*  vision of America where there are no black women law professors and there are no black [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1188.1399999999999s)]
*  women vice presidents. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1192.38s)]
*  And they're too cowardly to come out and say that in plain language, but do not for a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6cXtYJVFI&t=1193.5s)]
