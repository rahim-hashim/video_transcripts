# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We have a proposed date for Donald Trump's trial on charges they tried to steal the 2020 election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=0.0s)]
*  In a court filing today, special counsel Jack Smith asked for a start date of January 2nd, 2024, which he said would vindicate the public's interest in a speedy trial. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=10.0s)]
*  The date will ultimately be decided by the judge presiding in that case, Judge Tanya Chutkin. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=21.0s)]
*  But even assuming she chooses a somewhat later start, that there may be some delays along the way, Donald Trump is probably going to face trial in this case before the presidential election next November. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=26.0s)]
*  Though he does have one critical possible Hail Mary remaining. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=39.0s)]
*  He and his lawyers could try to somehow find a way to kick the case up to the Supreme Court, where the conservative majority would rescue him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=45.0s)]
*  That was one of the last desperate plans for Donald Trump's coup back in 2021 to get the Supreme Court to rule in his favor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=54.0s)]
*  And we know there's at least one very conservative justice who one of Trump's coup plotters thought would be particularly inclined to help out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=61.0s)]
*  I speak of this man, Clarence Thomas. Now, Justice Thomas is probably the most right-wing member of the Supreme Court in living memory. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=71.0s)]
*  He's fully committed to remaking the country and its jurisprudence in his conservative vision. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=79.0s)]
*  The other thing you need to know about Clarence Thomas, and there's a lot about him, is that he's always wanted to be rich. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=84.0s)]
*  It's part of what drove him from a childhood in abject poverty to an Ivy League law school, as a recent PBS frontline documentary explained. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=90.0s)]
*  After Holy Cross, Clarence Thomas was off to a very different world once again, Yale Law School. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=100.0s)]
*  It was a chance to leave Pinpoint far behind, defy his grandfather's prophecy, and get positioned to make real money. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=108.0s)]
*  He had thought, well, you know what, I just go make me a bunch of money, maybe go to New York and be a lawyer. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=120.0s)]
*  For time, Thomas did work in the private sector for the agrochemical giant Monsanto, but by 1981, he was nominated for position in the Reagan administration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=127.0s)]
*  And then President George H.W. Bush elevated Thomas to a federal judgeship and in 1991 nominated him to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=137.0s)]
*  When Clarence Thomas chose to take that path, he was forgoing a lot, and I mean a lot of potential income, that he could have made outside of government in some fancy firm. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=144.0s)]
*  I mean, Supreme Court justices are paid well, but nowhere near as much as a top flight corporate lawyer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=154.0s)]
*  In fact, Thomas himself said in a 2001 speech to the Savannah Bar Association that it is not a job that you do for money. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=160.0s)]
*  The job is not worth doing for what they pay. It's not worth doing for the grief, but it is worth doing for the principle. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=169.0s)]
*  The other thing is, being a Supreme Court justice is also not a job that you leave. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=181.0s)]
*  Thomas has been on the court for more than 30 years now, and he's been making a very good upper middle class salary. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=186.0s)]
*  I mean, certainly enough to live comfortably and take nice vacations, all that stuff, but not enough to be really rich. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=193.0s)]
*  I mean, you do not get to be a flamboyantly rich guy if you're a Supreme Court justice, not from what they're paying you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=199.0s)]
*  But there are a lot of flamboyantly rich guys who do have a real interest in keeping Clarence Thomas on the court, people who share his vision, his right-wing ideology, who want him to rule in line with that vision. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=206.0s)]
*  And so some of these people seem to have created a way of letting Thomas kind of have his cake and eat it too. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=218.0s)]
*  Thomas stays put on the court in his supremely important, though public sector job, and his wealthy right-wing supporters pay for him to live like a rich guy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=225.0s)]
*  In fact, new reporting from ProPublica today reveals that Thomas has received gifts, quote, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=235.0s)]
*  underwritten by benefactors who share the ideology that tries his jurisprudence, including, and here we start to get to the numbers, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=241.0s)]
*  at least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas, 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=248.0s)]
*  a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events typically perched in the skybox, two stays at a luxury resort in Florida and Jamaica, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=259.0s)]
*  and one standing invitation to an Uber exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=267.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, just so we get the numbers straight, that comes on top of previous investigations revealing details about the billionaire Republican donor [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=272.0s)]
*  who purchased property from Thomas, including his mother's home where she now lives rent-free, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=280.0s)]
*  and paid for the private school tuition of his grandnephew who Thomas raised as a son, none of which Thomas has ever disclosed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=285.0s)]
*  So when you take a step back, this is what appears to be the deal, if you will, between Clarence Thomas and his right-wing benefactors. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=294.0s)]
*  You want yachts? We got yachts. You want private jets? We got private jets. You want a fancy elite education for your adopted son? We've got it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=303.0s)]
*  We will give you the life of luxury you want if you stay on the court where we need you, pursuing the ideological project we are all committed to. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=311.0s)]
*  This is why gifts, particularly to judges, I mean to any public official, right, but to judges, are supposed to be at the very least disclosed [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=321.0s)]
*  and hopefully regulated or banned. It can be shockingly corrupt for a judge to be dependent on wealthy benefactors giving him lots of stuff. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=330.0s)]
*  But this deal has meant that Clarence Thomas is essentially a kept man, one of the most powerful men in the country who sits on the highest court in the land [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=339.0s)]
*  lifetime tenure. There's essentially no way to dislodge him. And apart from the dangers of this as it relates to his day-to-day job, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=349.0s)]
*  and their significant ruling on the most important cases in the country, the common Supreme Court, it has also set up real implications as it relates to what [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=357.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was trying to do on January 6th. So we already know, right, that Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginny, was corresponding with Mark Meadows about the election [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=365.0s)]
*  and also corresponding with one of Trump's lawyers, John Eastman, that man there, after the election. Now, Eastman is kind of in the Thomas circle. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=376.0s)]
*  He was the author of the original coup memo, and he's also a former Thomas clerk. On December 4th, 2020, Ginny asked Eastman if he would present a status update [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=383.0s)]
*  to a group of grassroots state leaders, presumably an update on Eastman and other possible unindicted code conspirators' efforts to help Donald Trump steal the election. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=396.0s)]
*  We also know that John Eastman spoke about his theory to overturn the 2020 results with a lawyer for Vice President Mike Pence, Greg Jacob. And in that conversation, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=408.0s)]
*  John Eastman talked about how he thought it would play out if a dispute over the election made it all the way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=417.0s)]
*  This comes from Jacob's testimony to the January 6th committee last year. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=424.0s)]
*  Mr. Jacob, you discussed and even debated this theory at length with Dr. Eastman. Did Dr. Eastman ever tell you what he thought the U.S. Supreme Court would do if it had to decide this issue? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=429.0s)]
*  Yes. We had an extended discussion, an hour and a half to two hours on January 5th. And when I pressed him on the point, I said, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=442.0s)]
*  John, if the vice president did what you were asking him to do, we would lose nine to nothing in the Supreme Court, wouldn't we? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=454.0s)]
*  And he initially started it. Well, I think maybe you would lose only seven to two. And after some further discussion, acknowledged, well, yeah, you're right. We would lose nine nothing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=461.0s)]
*  Nine nothing or seven to two. Now, I think I could come up with who those two might be. Who were two justices who would be willing to transgress the law so thoroughly that they would endorse a coup? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=473.0s)]
*  They were really counting on Clarence Thomas, the Kep man. Clearly, he would be one of the two to vote in their favor, and he could even be counted on to unilaterally rule for them in an emergency appeal as the what's called circuit justice for Georgia. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=486.0s)]
*  So this is another email from the coup plotters. This was written by another Trump lawyer named Kenneth Chisbro, who wrote another coup memo recently revealed by The New York Times. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=500.0s)]
*  We've covered it here. So Chisbro writes to Eastman, quote, possibly as they're spelling out how they're going to steal the election, possibly Thomas would end up being the key here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=510.0s)]
*  We want to frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue some sort of stay or other circuit justice opinion saying Georgia is in legitimate doubt. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=520.0s)]
*  Realistically, our only chance to get a favorable judicial opinion by January 6, which might hold up the Georgia count in Congress is from Thomas. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=531.0s)]
*  Of course, it didn't play out the way they had planned. It never got up to the court. The system held. The will of voters were heard. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=545.0s)]
*  The will of voters were heard. And I want to be fair here. I think the theory was so cockamamie that even if it had gone to the Supreme Court, I would hope that Greg Jacob was right and it would have died a 9-0 death. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=551.0s)]
*  I'd hope. In the end, the coup did not work. Joe Biden became president. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=562.0s)]
*  But what happens if some aspect of Donald Trump's election case ends up in front of this Supreme Court? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=568.0s)]
*  What if they have an opportunity not to do anything affirmative, but just to delay, just to kick the can, maybe even silently so that he spared a trial before the election? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=574.0s)]
*  Will Clarence Thomas, the kept man whose life of luxury is subsidized by right wing benefactors, deliver for the right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=584.0s)]
*  Arguably for the first time, you're seeing some kind of justice meted out to some of the folks who are on the front lines of Donald Trump's so-called fake electors. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=591.0s)]
*  You may remember this scene from back in December 2020 when false Trump electors in Michigan were caught on camera trying to enter the state house to file their fake document, effectively claiming Trump should win the state's electoral votes despite losing, well, by the way, the election. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=600.0s)]
*  In total, all 16 of the fake electors were charged with eight felony counts each by the Michigan attorney general. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=616.0s)]
*  Today, some of those people that were trying to claw their way in the state house were filmed in a different context, being read their rights and negotiating bail as part of a virtual arraignment. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=622.0s)]
*  Alleged that you did unlawfully conspire, combine, confederate, and agree together with Kathy Burden, Mayra Rodriguez, Michon Maddock, and other persons to falsely make, alter, forge, or counterfeit a public record with the intent to injure or defraud contrary to law enforcement. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=631.0s)]
*  That is a felony that you attempted to defraud by the certificate of votes of the 2020 electors from Michigan. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=644.0s)]
*  That is a felony, ma'am. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=653.0s)]
*  Maximum penalty for defrauding a public record. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=656.0s)]
*  That is a felony that you attempted to defraud by the certificate of votes of the 2020 electors from Michigan. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=661.0s)]
*  That is a felony, ma'am. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=670.0s)]
*  Maximum penalty, 14 years and or $10,000. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=672.0s)]
*  That's what it looks and it sounds like when the foot soldiers in the plot to steal the election face their day in court, at least the beginning of it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=678.0s)]
*  In addition to those charges in Michigan, we know Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fonny Willis has been investigating the fake electors in her state. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=685.0s)]
*  Now being reported, she is considering charging more than a dozen individuals related to Trump's coup attempt. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=693.0s)]
*  So if the fake electors scheme is criminal in Michigan, possibly criminal in Georgia, it seems to me it would stand to reason that it's likely criminal in the other five states where Republicans filed those false documents. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=699.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Rick Haasen, professor of law at UCLA and the director of its Safeguarding Democracy Project. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=712.0s)]
*  Rick, what do you think about, you know, obviously there's been all eyes on Jack Smith and the federal government, the Department of Justice. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=719.0s)]
*  There's the New York case, which has nothing to do with the 2020 election. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=725.0s)]
*  But what do you think of someone who's a scholar of democracy and election law about criminal charges against the folks in Michigan and possibly in other states? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=728.0s)]
*  Well, every state's got their own laws and each state's path when it came to these fake electors look different. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=739.0s)]
*  You know, at first this looked like it was just a backstop. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=747.0s)]
*  Like, what if we file a lawsuit and it turns out that Trump has declared the winner in our state? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=750.0s)]
*  We need to have those electors picked or Trump's electors might not count on a technicality. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=756.0s)]
*  That's very different from the memo we saw coming out later on coming from one of Trump's allies, which basically said, yeah, we know we've lost, but we're going to do this anyway because it might be a way to stall things and keep Biden from becoming president. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=760.0s)]
*  So it's going to depend on the facts in each state and it's also going to depend on each state's law. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=775.0s)]
*  You know, you bring that up. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=780.0s)]
*  You bring that up. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=782.0s)]
*  One really interesting detail I've returned to a few times on this program is in a few states, I believe it was New Mexico and Pennsylvania, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=783.0s)]
*  They added a caveat. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=793.0s)]
*  Here's the one in Pennsylvania. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=794.0s)]
*  Unlike Michigan, Pennsylvania's alternate electors are unlikely to face criminal repercussions because of an important legal caveat they added to their document. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=796.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania's certificate said the votes they were casting should only be counted if a court found that they were the duly elected and qualified electors. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=805.0s)]
*  And I find that so fascinating because in some ways it's just one sentence with a conditional clause. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=812.0s)]
*  Well, lawyer, I would say, but it's also the difference between trying to commit fraud and not trying to commit fraud. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=818.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=826.0s)]
*  And, you know, it might well have been very prudent for these electors to think about getting together because we've got this crazy Byzantine system of translating the people's votes into electoral college votes that get counted in Congress. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=827.0s)]
*  And so, you know, good lawyering would probably tell you that you want to have a backup in case Trump is declared by a court to be the winner in that state. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=842.0s)]
*  And that does, you know, to the extent that these fraud cases turn on people's state of mind, their intent, this does show we don't intend to break the law. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=849.0s)]
*  We're just trying to cover ourselves in the event that there's a judicial change in the result. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=858.0s)]
*  Obviously, you've been writing about election law for a long time. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=864.0s)]
*  It's an area of law that's grown more contested and thwartier and higher salience, I would say. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=868.0s)]
*  There's a really interesting piece that's been published by two conservative law professors. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=875.0s)]
*  And they're sort of self-proclaimed originalists. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=882.0s)]
*  And they're arguing that the Constitution requires Trump to be barred from office. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=886.0s)]
*  Two prominent conservative law professors have concluded that Donald J. Trump is ineligible to be present under a provision of the Constitution that bars people who have engaged in an insurrection from holding government office. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=892.0s)]
*  Professor William Baud summarized the article's conclusion. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=903.0s)]
*  Donald Trump cannot be president, cannot run for president, cannot become president, cannot hold office unless two thirds of Congress decides to grant him amnesty for his conduct on January 6. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=905.0s)]
*  You know, that clause has been there in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, written obviously in the wake of the Civil War and the insurrection against the Union. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=916.0s)]
*  What do you think of this? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=925.0s)]
*  Well, this is the big sleeper issue. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=927.0s)]
*  Most people are not paying attention to this, but in a number of states there are actions already being taken, not just against Trump, but against others to try to disqualify them from serving. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=930.0s)]
*  I think that the most important thing about this claim under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is that these issues have to get resolved pretty fast. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=939.0s)]
*  Because, you know, what happens if Trump wins the election? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=948.0s)]
*  And then when it comes time, January 6, 2025, Democrats in Congress, let's say they control one of the House of Congress, they say, no, sorry, he's ineligible. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=952.0s)]
*  But that would be a huge crisis if we've had an election and Trump's been declared the winner and now we've got this legal thing that just gets pulled out. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=962.0s)]
*  So however this gets resolved legally, I think it needs to get resolved sooner rather than later. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=969.0s)]
*  That's a really, really, really good point, Rick Hassan. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=975.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=979.0s)]
*  It is the hottest summer on record and Hawaii is burning. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=982.0s)]
*  The islands are one of the most remote inhabited places in the entire world, sitting more than 2300 miles from California to the east, nearly 4000 miles from Japan to the west. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=985.0s)]
*  Right now, wildfires are ravaging the state. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=994.0s)]
*  You've probably seen some of these terrifying scenes that have come out of California in the past few years, but they're now tearing through the island of Maui. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=998.0s)]
*  This is what it looked like yesterday as the fires destroyed businesses in Lahaina, an area rich with native Hawaiian history. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1005.0s)]
*  Nearly 2000 buildings, 2000 buildings have been burned down, 53 deaths confirmed on Maui. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1013.0s)]
*  A number of the governor now says he expects to rise in updates just later tonight. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1019.0s)]
*  The state office of emergency management says it is still trying to get a handle on the fires as thousands of tourists and residents rush to evacuate the island. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1024.0s)]
*  Airlines are canceling flights to Maui, repurposing those planes to assist in the evacuations. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1033.0s)]
*  And the fire is the result of a number of factors, from invasive plant species and grasslands to drought. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1038.0s)]
*  And they come as atmospheric carbon is producing record heat and a climate far more extreme and unstable than any any of us have experienced in our lifetimes. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1044.0s)]
*  Senator Mazie Hirono is a Democrat representing Hawaii, and she joins me now. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1054.0s)]
*  Senator, first of all, I just want to say that everyone in the country is watching these scenes appalled and sending support to the state of Hawaii. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1059.0s)]
*  I know it's brutal there. What's your read from what you're hearing from the folks you're in touch with? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1068.0s)]
*  First of all, we want to thank everyone for the support that they want to provide to people of Hawaii. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1074.0s)]
*  And they can certainly go to Maui County dot gov and they will direct you to ways that you can help. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1081.0s)]
*  But, Chris, it's very clear that we are all experiencing the frequency and severity of major weather events such as hurricanes, flooding, drought, tornadoes. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1088.0s)]
*  And we had Hurricane Dora, which did tremendously created tremendous windy conditions that caused the flames on Maui to spread in unpredictable ways. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1101.0s)]
*  So climate change is something that we are experiencing on a regular basis. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1113.0s)]
*  And it certainly exacerbated the damage that is happening on Maui. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1118.0s)]
*  But we thank everyone for their good wishes and support. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1123.0s)]
*  I mean, on Maui, you've got an entire town with rich, obviously, Native Hawaiian history was once, if I understand correctly, the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom has been essentially leveled. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1127.0s)]
*  Obviously, the islands are going to need a lot of help in reconstruction. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1142.0s)]
*  Very much so. And that's why it's all hands on deck with the county, the state, federal government. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1148.0s)]
*  And right now we have what we call the family of federal agencies that are either on the island or getting there. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1154.0s)]
*  So this would be, of course, FEMA, the Department of Defense, Transportation, Energy, Agriculture, Army Corps of Engineers. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1162.0s)]
*  And I expect the SBA Administrator Guzman to be on Maui. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1171.0s)]
*  I will be accompanying her if she is able to come because the recovery is going to be long. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1176.0s)]
*  We're going to need all the support that we can get for our homeowners and our businesses. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1183.0s)]
*  And SBA is very much a part of that kind of recovery. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1187.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-4FqM2uRI&t=1201.0s)]
