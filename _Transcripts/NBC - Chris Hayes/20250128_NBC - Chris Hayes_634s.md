# Trump funding freeze is ‘chaotically spiteful madness,’ says Chris Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Let's start tonight with a question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=0.0s)]
*  Did America vote in 2024 to immediately halt federal efforts at veterans' suicide prevention? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=4.0s)]
*  Do you remember, like, veterans' suicide prevention being litigated in the debates? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=12.0s)]
*  Do you remember Donald Trump campaigning on stopping federal efforts on veterans' suicide prevention? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=17.0s)]
*  Of course not. And yet that seems to be what he tried to do today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=24.0s)]
*  Now, last week we brought you the news that tons of researchers at the National Institutes of Health had been unilaterally paused in their activities. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=29.0s)]
*  Research on cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, grant funding, study sessions, even some trials, it appears, all just immediately frozen, put on hold without explanation. Why? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=37.0s)]
*  Well, honestly, it's still not entirely clear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=47.0s)]
*  Now comes this document from the Office of Management and Budget. That's a sort of White House's budgeting arm. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=51.0s)]
*  Last night, that has effectively ordered unilateral freezes, just immediate unilateral freezes on federal grant spending. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=58.0s)]
*  This is a scheme straight out of Project 2025. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=67.0s)]
*  The two-page memo demands those spending freezes because, and I am quoting here, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=71.0s)]
*  The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and Green New Deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=76.0s)]
*  Now, a bunch of people took them to court, and this afternoon a federal judge temporarily put those spending freezes, which could total into the trillions of dollars, on hold, but just until arguments next week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=90.0s)]
*  But just to be clear, today was spent with people in every state of this country, Republicans, conservatives, liberals, all trying to figure out what was going to happen because this has enormous real-world consequences. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=104.0s)]
*  As the Washington Post put it, hours after the Trump administration announced a sweeping freeze on federal spending, the U.S. government fell into chaos Tuesday as officials braced for potential interruptions to programs that promote food safety, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=119.0s)]
*  combat crime, provide college-age aid, produce medical research, and respond to natural disasters. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=132.0s)]
*  As far as we can tell, and again, it's a little unclear, they just by fiat ordered a huge swath of congressionally appropriated funding signed by a president to halt. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=139.0s)]
*  Again, the scope of this order is still unclear. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=152.0s)]
*  Get this, according to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, access to the Medicaid services portal that the states use to interact with the payment system and Medicaid went down in all 50 states today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=155.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=167.0s)]
*  We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=169.0s)]
*  We're talking about 80 million Americans who use Medicaid for some of the most vulnerable of our population, but also broadly used. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=172.0s)]
*  And the portal for the payment system that the states use just went down. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=180.0s)]
*  No one explained why. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=185.0s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost of Florida noted this afternoon, just got off the phone with a medical provider who accepts Medicaid. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=187.0s)]
*  Because they are shut out from the Medicaid portal, they might not be able to make payroll. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=193.0s)]
*  They exclusively serve low-income Floridians. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=199.0s)]
*  Again, this is the payment portal system for Medicaid. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=202.0s)]
*  80 million people, hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=205.0s)]
*  Now, the White House took so much heat for this one, they are apparently blaming it on a glitch. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=208.0s)]
*  Quote, the White House is aware of the Medicaid website portal outage. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=214.0s)]
*  We expect the portal will be back online shortly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=218.0s)]
*  Okay, access now seems to be restored. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=221.0s)]
*  But did you do it on purpose or not? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=224.0s)]
*  Like, was it just an accident? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=226.0s)]
*  Everyone got cut out of the Medicaid portal when you froze all the funding? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=228.0s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone in the White House actually knows what they're doing here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=233.0s)]
*  Yesterday they said the funding freeze was for programs including but not limited to, again, I'm quoting their text here, including but not limited to those affected by Trump's executive orders targeting so-called DEI programs, really anti-discrimination programs, and other spending Trump has deemed woke. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=236.0s)]
*  Today, they said the freeze is expressly limited to those programs. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=254.0s)]
*  See the contradiction there? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=258.0s)]
*  Very confusing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=260.0s)]
*  But here's what's clear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=261.0s)]
*  They're messing with people's actual lives. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=263.0s)]
*  As Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland warns, federal grants to help veterans in rural areas access health care and grants to help veterans get other critical services, including suicide prevention resources, transition assistance, and housing for homeless veterans will be cut off if these budget freezes are implemented broadly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=266.0s)]
*  The list of what could be impacted, again, there's a lot of money that flows through federal governments into grants. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=287.0s)]
*  The list of what could be impacted includes grants for, get this, National Center for Missing Exploited Children, grants to prevent domestic violence against women, grants for the Meals on Wheels program that feeds elderly folks, grants for early childhood education, grants for funding the police, and fire departments. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=294.0s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=315.0s)]
*  What is all this for? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=318.0s)]
*  Well, it's to destroy the constitutional order of checks and balances enacted by the founders and then reformed, improved, and reinforced throughout the last 250 years. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=321.0s)]
*  And this is not my view. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=330.0s)]
*  This is Russ Vogt, we're going to talk about in a second, who talks about a post-constitutional order. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=332.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=337.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=338.0s)]
*  The constitutional order we have now supports a federal government that is supposed to serve the public good and not just solely the moment to moment corrupt whims of whoever is currently serving as president. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=339.0s)]
*  Trump and the Trump administration is carrying out in almost every quadrant a complete assault on that order for the glory of Donald Trump, so he can impose his will against the people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=354.0s)]
*  This is an immediate crisis for our kids, for public safety, for our seniors, for our health care system. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=367.0s)]
*  And why? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=373.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is trying to seize power. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=375.0s)]
*  That is what is happening. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=379.0s)]
*  Guess where Donald Trump is going to decide to unfreeze federal grants? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=381.0s)]
*  To the companies run by his billionaire friends, to the states and congressional districts run by members of Congress or governors that are loyal to him. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=387.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, we transition from a democracy to a monarchy, because that's what a king does, uses the money in the treasury to reward his friends and to punish his enemies. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=397.0s)]
*  And to be crystal clear, I mean, this order, these actions taken, what Trump is trying to do, just fly in the face of absolutely foundational bedrock constitutional principles. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=412.0s)]
*  The founders were clear as day, Article 1, that Congress, not the president, has the power of the purse, that it decides how money is to be spent. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=422.0s)]
*  Now, it is currently the position of the Trump administration, they've been vocal about this, they've written it down and whatnot, that the president instead can use the money to do the work. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=433.0s)]
*  Instead, can unilaterally, at his whim, decide, no, I don't care, we won't spend the money you appropriated. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=441.0s)]
*  We get to decide what gets spent, regardless of what Congress says. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=450.0s)]
*  That is the current position of the White House. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=454.0s)]
*  And the guy that Trump wants to run the Office of Management and Budget, that dude, the guy I was talking about before, that's the department behind these spending freezes, Russell Vought. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=457.0s)]
*  He has called the law regulating what spending the White House can block unconstitutional. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=466.0s)]
*  Now, Vought, you may remember, happens to be one of the chief architects of Project 2025, right? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=471.0s)]
*  And he was caught on camera saying Trump is going to deny this, but of course he's going to do Project 2025. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=478.0s)]
*  By the way, Project 2025 outlined basically this entire plan. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=484.0s)]
*  It called for the Republican president to act unilaterally to, quote, bring the administrative state to heel. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=488.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump blatantly lied about his knowledge of and connection to Project 2025 on the campaign trail. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=494.0s)]
*  It was polling at like 10 percent. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=501.0s)]
*  And you're seeing today why, right? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=503.0s)]
*  Freezing veteran suicide prevention programs. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=505.0s)]
*  But now he's just trying to force it down the throats of the American people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=509.0s)]
*  So I guess if Trump wants to halt funding for veteran suicide prevention programs, that these sycophants in the Republican Party think he should just be able to, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=513.0s)]
*  the ones who are in Congress, who should want to control appropriations of the power of the purse because they're in Congress. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=522.0s)]
*  Look, everything they've done the first few weeks here, week and a half, could not be clearer. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=533.0s)]
*  They're just going to try and do all this through essentially sheer force of will. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=537.0s)]
*  The question is, will people stand for this? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=543.0s)]
*  For instance, are Democrats going to vote to confirm Russell's vote, who as of now is set to be voted out from committee this Thursday? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=546.0s)]
*  Are the Republicans on the committee going to get calls from their constituents? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=553.0s)]
*  Will people flood the offices of the senators and their voice boxes with phone calls opposing Russell's vote's confirmation in states red and blue, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=557.0s)]
*  saying, no, we want the constitutional order, not the post-constitutional order he's advocating, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=568.0s)]
*  in which Russell voted Donald Trump unilaterally get to decide that Meals on Wheels is frozen? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=573.0s)]
*  Will Democrats in Congress in both houses throw themselves across the tracks of what is obviously both an illegal and unconstitutional power grab [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=579.0s)]
*  and also the most chaotically spiteful madness I think I've ever seen a federal officeholder undertake? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=588.0s)]
*  Right now there are stories running in every local market in this country about how this freeze would affect needed programs. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=594.0s)]
*  Public opinion didn't disappear when Donald Trump got elected by a point and a half or more. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=601.0s)]
*  What happens next is going to be determined what people do in response. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=606.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Rfp50DfZw&t=631.0s)]
