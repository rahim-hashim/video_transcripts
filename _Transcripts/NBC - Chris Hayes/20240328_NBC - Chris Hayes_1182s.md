# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: March 27
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes, the Republican National Committee, now firmly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=0.0s)]
*  in the hands of Donald Trump and his family. The party is now under the stewardship of, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=4.4s)]
*  among others, the ex-president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whose latest single, Anything [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Is Possible, drops this Friday. But in addition to her burgeoning musical career, Lara Trump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=14.16s)]
*  is hard at work reshaping the Republican Party into an organization based first and foremost [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=19.0s)]
*  around her father-in-law and his ongoing lies about the 2020 election, which he lost. As [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=24.12s)]
*  The Washington Post reports, quote, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=30.0s)]
*  Lara Trump confirmed to NBC News senior Capitol Hill correspondent Garrett Haake today, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  the RNC is all in on pushing election fraud nonsense heading into this next election. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=52.4s)]
*  Is it going to be the position of the RNC in 2024 that the 2020 election was not fairly decided or [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=57.48s)]
*  that it was stolen somehow? Well, I think we're past that. I think that's in the past. We learned [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=65.72s)]
*  a lot. Certainly we took a lot of notes. Right now we have 23 states that have 78 lawsuits in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=69.84s)]
*  these states to ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote. Here at this organization, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  we had sort of the inverse of this debate this week. Our litmus test is the opposite of the RNC. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=82.64s)]
*  We're going to be part of what we used to call a reality based community. One where we acknowledge [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=87.28s)]
*  the basic fact that Joe Biden won the 2020 election by 7 million votes. The Republican [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=92.08s)]
*  National Committee apparently does not live in reality. Instead, choosing to recede into a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=96.68s)]
*  fantasy world where the election was stolen from Donald Trump. Here's the thing that's the weirdest [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=101.16s)]
*  part of this whole thing. All right. Donald Trump is like a 50 50 coin flip to win the next election. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=106.12s)]
*  He's leading or tied in just about every relevant poll right now. He's got a real shot of outright [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  winning the election November, but it's so revealing. The MAGA movement isn't actually [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=116.44s)]
*  interested in winning in a small D democratic sense. It really looks to all the world based on [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  the way they have undertaken things at the RNC and the campaign. They would actually rather [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=127.16s)]
*  essentially steal the election or finish the project of upending American democracy entirely. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=132.2s)]
*  A total rejection of free and fair elections as an achievable aim is their intended goal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=138.92s)]
*  And this cultist devotion to the lie, the persistent enduring lie about widespread [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=145.24s)]
*  election fraud in 2020 is one of their ways of accomplishing that. Logistically speaking, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=149.88s)]
*  the problem with that strategy is that every single rational good faith actor can see the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=155.0s)]
*  election was not stolen. And every time the big lie is marched into an institution where facts [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=159.64s)]
*  and reality matter, it gets laughed out of the room. There's one thing that truly unites all [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=164.84s)]
*  Americans. It's that everyone hates paying more for stuff. That is why when inflation sent the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=170.84s)]
*  price of everyday goods soaring in the wake of the pandemic, you saw it reflected in poll after poll [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=175.8s)]
*  after poll. People's view of the economy plummeted. So did their approval of the president. In fact, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=180.44s)]
*  this happened basically across the Western world. It was everyone's first taste of real sharp [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=186.52s)]
*  inflation in a generation. And guess what? People really hated it, which is of course, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  completely understandable because, well, it really, really sucked. In 2020, your average [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=198.84s)]
*  family of four paid about $927 a month for groceries. At the height of inflation in 2022, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=204.36s)]
*  the average was $1,307 a month. That's $400 more on. Now that has started to come down actually in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=211.08s)]
*  real terms. The average at the end of last year was around $1,261, but again, still up from 2020. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=218.68s)]
*  And the experience of paying more and more and feeling like prices are out of control and feeling [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=224.84s)]
*  squeezed translates to disaffection. And that disaffection is probably the single biggest [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=229.24s)]
*  advantage you can have as say the challenger to an incumbent president operating in a world [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=235.8s)]
*  in which prices have gone. And yet the Republican challenger, President Biden, isn't running on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=241.88s)]
*  lowering prices. He's actually running on jacking up prices on a huge amount of the goods we use [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=249.08s)]
*  every day. And I know it sounds like I'm making this up, but genuinely, and I want to be clear [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=254.52s)]
*  here, his core economic policy proposal right now is an across the board consumer sales tax [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=260.2s)]
*  for every single good imported into the United States. Now he may call it a tariff, but it will [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=267.08s)]
*  just be passed along to consumers in a sales tax on every single good that is imported. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=272.76s)]
*  And again, you do not need to take my word for it. Just listen to Donald Trump himself. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=278.12s)]
*  The President's speech. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  Number one, I think we should have a ring around the collar, as they say. I think when companies [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=283.88s)]
*  come in and they dump their products in the United States, they should pay automatically, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  let's say a 10% tax. I'm a big believer in tariffs for two reasons. Number one, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  I fully believe in them economically when you're being taken advantage of by other countries. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=299.08s)]
*  I would say to China, if you're building a plant on our border to build cars in Mexico and to sell [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  them into the United States, I'm putting a 50% tariff on all those cars. You use tariffs and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=310.68s)]
*  sanctions against China. I did, and I did very well with it. As you know, we took in hundreds [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=316.44s)]
*  of billions of dollars in taxes through the tariffs, taxes and tariffs. Is that what you want to do [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=320.68s)]
*  again? We have to do it. Okay, if you are a single issue inflation voter, there is only one candidate [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=324.92s)]
*  who wants to put a 10% tax that will be passed along to consumers as a sales tax on every single [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  good that's imported. And here's the thing, this is not a hypothetical. Trump did a miniature [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=339.56s)]
*  version of this the last time he was president when he put tariffs on different Chinese goods. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=344.44s)]
*  Here's how that worked out. According to analysis by the New York Fed, the average import tariff [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=348.6s)]
*  rate more than doubled in 2018 alone. It tangibly led to higher domestic consumer prices. Take the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=353.56s)]
*  first two tariffs on washing machines and steel. Economists found that consumer prices for washing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=359.32s)]
*  machines, which have been going down steadily since 2012, almost immediately jumped back up [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=365.08s)]
*  after Trump's tariffs. In fact, the New York Times found that the washer specific tariffs raised [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  costs for importers like LG and Samsung. The steel import tariffs raised costs for some domestic [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  manufacturers like Whirlpool pushing prices up for consumers. Now Trump wants to do it again, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=380.36s)]
*  but bigger. Okay, now you can argue this is going to in the long run help American manufacturing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=386.36s)]
*  There's some argument on the other side of it, but in the short term, like what's going to happen [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=392.68s)]
*  is the prices are going to go up. The Democratic Alliance Center for American Progress found that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=396.68s)]
*  Trump's proposed new tariffs would cost typical households an extra $1,500 per year. Here's what [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=400.92s)]
*  that might look like. Trump is proposing a 10% tariff. If that 10% gets passed on to consumers, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=408.36s)]
*  which is generally how it works, things will cost more. Now we don't know exactly how much [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=412.92s)]
*  everything would cost, but you just add 10% on the back of the napkin. Here's the cost of lending [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=417.32s)]
*  living under the Trump tax. Start with groceries, which has been a site of a lot of angst, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=422.12s)]
*  A dozen egg cost about $3. Once you apply the Trump tax, that goes up to $3.30. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=428.44s)]
*  And with the US importing more than 4 million eggs a year, that could cost American consumers [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=433.48s)]
*  over $1.2 million. If you like oranges, those currently go for about $1.53 per pound. With [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=437.56s)]
*  the 10% Trump tax, it would be $1.68 per pound, which would cost American consumers almost $71 [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=443.88s)]
*  million for the nearly half a billion pounds that we import. Or how about bananas? We don't [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=449.72s)]
*  really grow them in the US, do we? They average about $0.63 per pound, going up to 69 per cents [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=455.24s)]
*  per pound with the Trump tax. And thanks to the US importing more than 10 billion with a B pounds [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=460.44000000000005s)]
*  per year, that could cost Americans $609 million. That's a $609 million tax on American consumers. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=465.72s)]
*  Then there's tomatoes. They go for about $213 per pound. Apply a 10% Trump tax. They would be [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=474.76s)]
*  $234 per pound, potentially costing Americans $3.5 million, thanks to the 16.5 million pounds we [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=480.6s)]
*  import per year. The point is, if you are spending $1,200 a month on groceries, add another $120 to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  the bill. That's more than even the peak of inflation in 2022, which topped off at 9%. This [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=492.92s)]
*  is 10%, okay? And it's not just groceries. How about the refrigerator? You need to keep those [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=499.0s)]
*  groceries fresh. Right now, the average cost of a new fridge is about $1,300. With the Trump tax, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=504.44s)]
*  that could go up to $1,430, costing Americans $1.95 billion for the 15 million refrigerators [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=509.8s)]
*  that we import. Again, that's $1.95 billion in new taxes. What about the car? You need to drive the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=517.96s)]
*  grocery store. On average, a new car costs about $48,808 today. With the Trump tax, it could cost [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=524.44s)]
*  $53,684, with Americans potentially taking a $66.3 billion hit across the more than 13 million cars [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=532.04s)]
*  we import. And that's not even with the 50% tariff that he says he wants to slap on imported cars, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=541.24s)]
*  which would make it another $25,000. Even the smartphone in your pocket costs on average about [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=546.8399999999999s)]
*  $940 right now. With the Trump tax, that could go up to $1,034, with Americans potentially paying [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=553.88s)]
*  an extra $13.2 billion for the nearly 141 million smartphones we import per year. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=560.76s)]
*  Everyone hates when you have to pay more for things. Inflation is one of the biggest [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=570.52s)]
*  vulnerabilities for a sitting president. And yet, here's Donald Trump in the year of our Lord 2024, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=573.56s)]
*  running against President Biden, promising to make things more expensive for every American. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=580.2s)]
*  Well, that brings us to Arizona Senate candidate, currently Senate candidate, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=586.76s)]
*  Carrie Lake. Now, she previously ran for governor back in 2022, where she emerged as one of the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=592.28s)]
*  fiercest defenders of Trump's coup, as well as a general antagonist to those in the press who tried [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=597.56s)]
*  to correct her lies. We had a fraudulent election, a corrupt election, and we have an illegitimate [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=602.52s)]
*  president sitting in the White House. The fake news wants us to think that that guy got 81 million [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=608.92s)]
*  votes. Okay. Alrighty. I am going to not only be the governor of Arizona for four years, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=614.84s)]
*  I'm going to do two terms. I'm going to be your worst freaking nightmare for eight years. And we [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=628.0400000000001s)]
*  will reform the media as well. We're going to make you guys into journalists again. So get ready. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=633.4s)]
*  It's going to be a fun eight years. I can't wait. It is going to be fun. She lost. But I guess to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=639.64s)]
*  her perverse credit, Carrie Lake really fully committed to the bit, going around to any fringe [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=645.0s)]
*  MAGA outlet that would take her and claiming without any evidence at all that the 2022, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=650.36s)]
*  the midterm election that she lost were stolen as well. We know that we won. We know that we [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=655.64s)]
*  showed up in droves and we know that they intentionally sabotaged election day. So we're [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  going to fight to get the rightful duly elected governor myself into office. We won our election. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=667.16s)]
*  I know that that my opponent who is sitting in the governor's office is a fraud and we are fighting [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=672.36s)]
*  that in the courts. And so I really understand what president Trump is up against because [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=679.16s)]
*  they did the same thing to him in 2020. We cannot have the election stand. The judge should declare [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=683.24s)]
*  me the rightful winner. I am the rightful winner and we should move on and reclaim our government, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=688.8399999999999s)]
*  our state government has been hijacked and stolen by a bunch of people who know this election was [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=695.24s)]
*  fraudulent. The people already know who the legitimate governor is and you're looking at her, Steve. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=701.08s)]
*  Now she lost the election. She did win the best webcam in all of politics competition years running. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=706.28s)]
*  It is the best. Donald Trump backed an entire slate of election deniers in 2022, Carrie Lake [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=711.72s)]
*  among them, and they all lost. But the thing about Lake that really makes her stand out is [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=717.4s)]
*  she appears to be the only one who pulled a big lie of her own, right? And insisted she was the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=720.84s)]
*  real winner. Actually, she did this so often in fact that she got herself sued by an elections [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=725.88s)]
*  official in Arizona. Republican Stephen Richard, the Maricopa County recorder who oversaw Lake's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=731.64s)]
*  loss, again, a Republican, took her to court over her repeated false claims that Richard rigged the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=737.96s)]
*  election against her. He sued her for defamation in June last year and Lake has been stalling on [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=743.88s)]
*  the case ever since until now. She just filed a motion for default judgment, which essentially [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=749.08s)]
*  means she is not contesting her liability because of we have seen time and time and time and time [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=754.2s)]
*  again when it comes to lies about election fraud. You can't defend the indefensible. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=760.12s)]
*  I'm joined now by the man who is suing Carrie Lake, Stephen Richard. He's the Maricopa County [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=765.08s)]
*  recorder along with his lawyer, Jared Davidson, a staff attorney at Protect Democracy. Stephen, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=769.4000000000001s)]
*  let me start with you and just tell me about what prompted you to take the somewhat extraordinary [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=774.28s)]
*  step of filing this lawsuit in the aftermath of that of that 2022 election. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=779.88s)]
*  Yeah, it wouldn't stop and simply put, that's that's why we felt like we had to do this. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=787.0s)]
*  We waited until she filed those claims with the court. She lost at the Superior Court. She lost [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=792.28s)]
*  at the Court of Appeals. She lost at the Arizona Supreme Court. Then she filed another lawsuit. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=797.24s)]
*  Then I was hoping she would finally get a new job, but she kept talking about it and she made [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=802.04s)]
*  it the centerpiece of all of her fundraising appeals and of her political prominence and even [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=806.28s)]
*  a book deal. And so I figured she's not getting a new job. I am the job and defaming my good name to [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=811.9599999999999s)]
*  her millions of followers, as she's so proud to proclaim, was her profession at that point. And so [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=818.52s)]
*  really, this is the first time and hopefully the last time I've ever sued anyone in my individual [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  capacity. But I talked to the team at Protect Democracy and we thought we had a strong case. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=828.76s)]
*  And indeed, we do have a strong case. Jared, let me let me ask you just legally the significance [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=833.16s)]
*  of today, the filing that she's not basically not going to contest the defamation. She wants to fight [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=838.84s)]
*  on the grounds of damages. But that means basically you caught me. I can't go into court and say what [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=845.24s)]
*  I was saying was true about Mr. Richard. That's exactly right, Chris. This is an unequivocal [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=851.4s)]
*  admission by Ms. Lake that she has no evidence whatsoever to support her claims that Mr. Richard [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=860.28s)]
*  engaged in misconduct in the 2022 election. Of course, we all knew that she had no evidence [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=867.8s)]
*  all along. But Ms. Lake has repeatedly been stating that she is looking forward to showing [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=873.4s)]
*  receipts. And yesterday, she told her supporters that instead she has no evidence. She's waving [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=880.36s)]
*  the white flag. And so now we are moving forward not on liability, but rather we are going to be [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=888.36s)]
*  moving ahead to determine not whether Ms. Lake has to pay damages for the harm she's done to Steven, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=896.12s)]
*  but how much she's going to have to pay for the harm. I want to talk, Steven, to you about [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=903.0s)]
*  that aspect of it. Again, I want to stress this. You're a Republican official in Maricopa County, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=909.0s)]
*  right? Yes. And you were targeted by Ms. Lake in some of the sort of baroque conspiracy theories [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=914.52s)]
*  that she was weaving. And from my perspective, this is someone who lied about the 2020 election. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=922.92s)]
*  It seemed obvious she was lying about the 2022 election when she said she hadn't won. But I also [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=929.08s)]
*  know that people on the wrong side of these sorts of lies can really have their lives upended, their [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=934.44s)]
*  careers. Like, what is it meant to be the target of these lies? Well, it doesn't take much imagination [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=938.6s)]
*  to foresee the possibility that of your millions of followers, when you tell them that this man, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=946.76s)]
*  Steven Richer, has committed the most heinous crimes against our democracy, it doesn't take [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=953.24s)]
*  much imagination that one of your followers, two of your followers, might do something very extreme [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=958.6800000000001s)]
*  based off of that. So in recent months, we've had two people arrested for threats to me. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=964.9200000000001s)]
*  I get on a daily basis messages about why I should be in Gitmo, why I should be in jail. And like I [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=969.96s)]
*  said, this needs to stop. That's why we filed this lawsuit. It is a bit rich, as Jared mentioned, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=976.84s)]
*  that this is coming from somebody who said she had all the evidence and she was going to fight to the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=981.88s)]
*  bitter end. Well, she just put up the white flag. She doesn't have any evidence. And while she's [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=986.84s)]
*  lying about me, she is lying to Arizonans, some Arizonans who have gone to jail, some Arizonans [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=991.8s)]
*  who have given her campaign money. It was all a lie that is now entered in court. Yeah, Lake's team [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  on Tuesday filed that default judgment motion that indicated she wouldn't challenge a culpability. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  They said that Richer should turn over relevant medical and psychiatric records to show his health [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1009.8s)]
*  was negatively affected. As he detailed in his lawsuit, Lake requested a jury for the default [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  judgment hearing. So Jared, there will be some adjudicated process here, but again, it will not [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1018.76s)]
*  be on the on the basic facts here, which she was so eager to contest. She has completely waived the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1024.04s)]
*  white flag. This is all going to be on the damages portion of this. That's exactly right. Ms. Lake has [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1029.0s)]
*  conceded that she has no evidence whatsoever to defend herself. Again, we've known it all along, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1036.12s)]
*  but she's been telling her supporters she's got the receipts. We've known that she doesn't. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1042.92s)]
*  And so now that she has surrendered, the case will move forward purely on the question of how much [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1049.0s)]
*  she's going to have to compensate Stephen for the immense harm that she's caused him. Stephen, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  just to zoom out for a second, you're sort of right on this fault line of American politics, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1063.16s)]
*  particularly Maricopa County and particularly in Arizona. And we've seen Republican members of the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1067.32s)]
*  officials in your party on both sides of it. Right. And it doesn't really have to do about ideology. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1075.16s)]
*  I don't know what your views are on like tax rates or abortion or a million different ideological [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1080.52s)]
*  questions. It's really just on the line of this basic fidelity to the truth and the facts. And [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1085.24s)]
*  how, how, what has that done to politics in your state? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1091.8s)]
*  So, so tax rates should be as low as possible. I want to make sure we're clear on that. So that's [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1097.8s)]
*  how I feel about tax rates. I figured as much. But two plus two, two plus two equals four. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1102.76s)]
*  And that's a truth that always has been a truth and will be a truth. Unfortunately, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1108.68s)]
*  it has become something of a litmus test in some quarters. Now, not it's not entirely dispositive, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1113.64s)]
*  I'm going to buck that trend in my election, but it unfortunately factored in significantly. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1119.16s)]
*  And I will say to the ultimate detriment of Republican candidates, many of those candidates [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1125.0s)]
*  who won their primary based off of the big lie, that didn't carry over to the median Arizona voter. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  It's a losing strategy. It's lost in 23. It's lost in 22. It's lost in 21. It lost in 20. But more [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1137.0800000000002s)]
*  than that, it's immoral and people know better and leaders need to stop giving this any legitimacy. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7_S7z5p00&t=1143.64s)]
