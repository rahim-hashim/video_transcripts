# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw)
*  All right, we just got some big news out of Kentucky. Steve Kornacki is still at the big [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=0.0s)]
*  board. Steve, what's the latest? Yeah, our decision desk has now made it official and they are [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  comfortable declaring that Andy Beshear, the Democratic incumbent governor of Kentucky, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=8.8s)]
*  has been re-elected, that he will defeat his Republican challenger, the state, the sitting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=13.92s)]
*  attorney general, Daniel Cameron. We've been, no surprise if you've been watching all night, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=18.72s)]
*  we've been seeing county after county come in in Kentucky with Beshear running ahead of how he [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=24.24s)]
*  ran in 2019, not by leaps and bounds, but by several points, just county after county. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=30.88s)]
*  The pattern very clear at this point, this is a state he won by less than 1.4 years ago. He had a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=36.4s)]
*  very high approval rating, very high personal favorability rating. The Cameron campaign and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=42.0s)]
*  Republicans had been hoping to attach Beshear to Joe Biden, to the National Democratic Party, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=47.12s)]
*  both of which remain very unpopular in Kentucky, but it looks like that personal popularity and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=52.56s)]
*  that high job approval rating for Beshear have won out. He is going to get a second term. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=57.36s)]
*  He's the second Beshear to get a second term as governor of Kentucky. His father was a two-term [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=62.88s)]
*  governor as well not that long ago. Just again, we can show you we got a big batch of votes from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  Louisville, Jefferson County, core Democratic county. We said this would be a big trench of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=75.12s)]
*  Beshear votes. A few of those came in just a little while ago. You look around the Lexington [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=79.76s)]
*  area and I think you really see it though. The improvement for Beshear over last time around, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=83.84s)]
*  he's running six points better in Fayette County, second biggest county in the state [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  than he did four years ago. You look up in Scott County, he's running at 55 percent basically now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  He was under 54 years ago there. Take a look at the state capital, Franklin County, where [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Frankfurt is. He got 61 percent of the vote here four years ago. He's at 68 and a half with almost [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=103.44s)]
*  95 percent in. So that has been the pattern. These big Democratic vote producing counties, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=108.88s)]
*  he's getting more votes out of in Republican counties. He's still losing them, but he's not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=114.08s)]
*  losing them by as much. It all adds up to what's going to be a victory for Andy Beshear in his [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=118.56s)]
*  second term in the governor's mansion. You know, one of the things in the lead up to the race, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=122.88s)]
*  there wasn't a ton of polling, but to the extent we had polling, we looked at approval ratings. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=126.64s)]
*  This was my understanding and folks in Kentucky politics, the expectation at least was that heading [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=131.36s)]
*  into night Beshear was the favorite, that he'd run a pretty good campaign, that he was a fairly [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=138.0s)]
*  popular incumbent. Is that generally your sense? I would say yeah, until a week ago, roughly, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=142.16s)]
*  or a little bit less. There was a poll that came out at the end of last week that had the race tied. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=148.88s)]
*  Yep. And there was a second poll that came out yesterday that had it at two points. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=154.32s)]
*  There was a thought that it was possible. Cameron changed tactics late in this campaign. He'd been [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=159.12s)]
*  running a very sort of aggressive anti-Beshear campaign. He's had some name calling involved. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=164.32s)]
*  Toward the end of the campaign, the Cameron folks shifted tactics and he put an ad up on the air [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=171.68s)]
*  where he talks to the camera and he says, you know, Andy Beshear is not a bad guy. And then he says, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=176.96s)]
*  but we just have some disagreements. It was a very different tone. And so there was a question [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=181.84s)]
*  when you saw that polling in the final days, if that shift in tone coupled with the antipathy of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=186.56s)]
*  Kentucky voters towards Biden, towards the national democratic party, if that would add up to a late [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=191.36s)]
*  kick here for Cameron, it would close the gap. It may end up closing the gap to a degree that he [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  doesn't lose this thing by what it looked a month ago, like he was going to lose it by, but it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=202.4s)]
*  certainly wasn't enough to get him over the top. Yeah. It's also interesting. They really did. I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=206.8s)]
*  mean, I saw some of the ads, I saw the campaign spots. There really was a focus on Joe Biden. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=210.08s)]
*  There really was like Andy Beshear is Joe Biden's buddy, Andy Beshear and Joe Biden. That was a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=214.32s)]
*  central thrust, which does not appear to have been effective, at least not to get them over the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=219.28s)]
*  hump for victory. Steve Kornacki, thank you very much. All right. Tomorrow Ivanka Trump, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=223.76s)]
*  former senior White House official, which is sort of still funny to say, an eldest daughter of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=229.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is expected to testify in the New York attorney general's $250 million lawsuit against [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=235.28s)]
*  her daddy and the Trump organization. She's going to have a tough act to follow after her father's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=241.36s)]
*  preposterous performance on the stand yesterday, including one incident that led the judge to tell [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump's lawyer, quote, I would beseech you to control him if you can. If you can't, I will. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can. Do you understand that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  And there are also more substantive moments when Trump admitted he had signed a document making [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=260.16s)]
*  representations about his financial situation, quote, in order to induce lender to accept this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=264.56s)]
*  guarantee and to enter into the credit agreement. MSNBC legal analyst Katie Fang points out that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=269.68s)]
*  this, quote, a critical admission by Trump that he admits that the intent in making these financial [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=275.12s)]
*  representations was to convince lenders to loan money. But ultimately, I think we've reached a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=280.16s)]
*  phase of this trial where it can best be compared to the infamous Chicago seven trial in 1969, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=286.24s)]
*  where the anti-war protesters on trial decided to turn the whole thing into a circus and, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=290.8s)]
*  you know, put the system on trial. Basically, the term that Donald Trump's attorneys have made here, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=295.2s)]
*  even at the risk of enraging the judge who will be the lone one deciding Trump's culpability in this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=300.64s)]
*  case. More importantly, every judge who has a Trump trial coming up should be watching this because [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=305.92s)]
*  it looks like a dress rehearsal to polarize opinion about the legitimacy of the previous [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=311.36s)]
*  proceedings themselves rather than try to win the case within the confines of the court. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=316.8s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin was in the courtroom for yesterday's performance, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=321.76s)]
*  and she joins me now. Does that scam to you that there is a tactical decision? There's different [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  ways to look at this. One is, oh, you can't restrain Trump and he doesn't have any self-control. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=331.36s)]
*  I don't quite buy that. The other is, basically, this is the tactic now is like trying to sort of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=335.36s)]
*  bait the judge into saying something that they could use for appeal and trying to sort of convert [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=341.92s)]
*  this into kind of a polarized prism of like, this judge is out to get me and that's really [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=346.88s)]
*  what they're up to. I think it can be both. I think there are moments where Trump showed he [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=353.44s)]
*  can be disciplined, and partially he showed that when he started to echo things that I know his [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=359.12s)]
*  lawyers have told him, right? When he talked about what you can expect during the rest of this trial, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=365.28s)]
*  which witnesses are going to come, which important thinkers will be there, which expert witnesses, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=370.24s)]
*  or he tried to pull out of his pocket somewhat preposterously the language of the disclaimer [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=375.2s)]
*  statement that appeared on each of his statements of financial condition. He's clearly fluent in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  some of what's going on in this case, and yet I'm not sure that his explosions at the judge, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  at Kevin Wallace, who's a lawyer with the AG's office, or even at Tish James herself, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=392.0s)]
*  were as calculated as people think. That's interesting. Yeah, so they read more organic to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=396.08s)]
*  you. They felt more organic because the tone was so different. You know, Chris, you and I have [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=401.04s)]
*  talked about before that as a watcher in the courtroom, when Trump goes out to the hallway [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  and he gives us impromptu press conferences, for security reasons, those of us who are in the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=410.16s)]
*  courtroom can't follow him out. We can't watch that. When I saw video of those press conferences [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  yesterday, I saw a Trump who was remarkably more cool and collected in his tone, even if the content [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=419.92s)]
*  of what he was saying was vitriolic, than he was when he lost his cool towards Judge Ingoron, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=426.08s)]
*  towards Tish James, towards Kevin Wallace, when he was saying, these proceedings are a disgrace, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  you're a disgrace, you called me a fraud and you didn't even know me. All of that felt very [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=436.0s)]
*  personal and very impulsive. Okay, so that's interesting. That feels like a person not making [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  a tactical. This is not, you know, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. I mean, this is someone who [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  has, is actually struggling to control himself. I mean, there clearly is a kind of pathos here, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=451.84s)]
*  which is that he's obsessed with being people thinking he has less money than he does, basically. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=457.44s)]
*  Like, yeah. And that, I mean, I guess the Occam's razor way of viewing his approach to this is just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=462.4s)]
*  that like, it really stresses him out for people to think that he's poorer. Oh, absolutely. In fact, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=468.24s)]
*  at one point they were talking about whether his brand value was incorporated in his financial [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  statements. He insisted that GAP allows you to do that. Spoiler alert for our viewers, it does not. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=478.08s)]
*  But at one point he said, my brand value got me elected president of the United States. So he is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=484.0s)]
*  well aware that the value of the Trump brand is part of his lore. It's not only part of his lore [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  as like control over an empire, but as a political dynasty as well. Do you think, what do you think [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=494.88s)]
*  about how his performance was as a witness, independent of the histrionics in terms of what [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=501.12s)]
*  it meant for what inferences on the facts that the fact finder in the case of Goren can draw? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=506.8s)]
*  Oh my God, it was disastrous. It was disaster. Absolutely. That's interesting. You know, one of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  the things that I keep trying to emphasize to folks is this isn't just the remedial phase of the trial. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=516.72s)]
*  This is about six more counts that the attorney general didn't ask for summary judgment or [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=522.08s)]
*  judgment before trial on, all of which necessitate proof of intent. Right. On that, the attorney [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=526.64s)]
*  general got lots of helpful admissions. He admitted he reviewed and approved financial [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=533.2s)]
*  statements and occasionally suggested changes. He agreed he was responsible for their fair [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=537.76s)]
*  presentation. He agreed he talked to Jeff McConney and Allen Weisselberg, the two top financial [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=542.96s)]
*  officials at the Trump organization about those. And he agreed at one point that he intended to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=547.6s)]
*  forever forfeit the right to use Mar-a-Lago as anything but a private club. That actually is part [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=554.0s)]
*  of a legally binding covenant document. Yes. And then in the next breath, he insisted, and I have [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=560.4s)]
*  the right to change that at any point in time. So it's like the rules do not apply that same Trump [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=565.92s)]
*  ethos definitely translated into this proceeding, but he nonetheless made a number of really damaging [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=570.88s)]
*  admissions. If you could see beyond the temper tantrums. Do you think the judge does? I think [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  the judge absolutely does. And I think the judge is much more facile with and familiar with the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=582.16s)]
*  documents than Trump himself is. And so, you know, Trump's insistence, you won't let me read from [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYs1xuGDEw&t=587.6s)]
