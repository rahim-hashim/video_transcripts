# ‘Midlife crisis:’ Pro-Trump lawyer Ken Chesebro’s road to Jan. 6 coup plotter
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes today a Washington DC Court of Appeals panel upheld a gag order against Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=0.0s)]
*  In the criminal case about his attempt to overturn the 2020 election [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  The three-judge panel narrowed the original order from district court judge Tonya Chutkin somewhat [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=11.24s)]
*  ruling that special counsel Jack Smith originally included in that order is now fair game, but [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=16.92s)]
*  Crucially the judges barred the ex-president from talking publicly about Smith's staff [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Court staff or other lawyers on the case. He is also prohibited from making and I quote here [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=27.66s)]
*  Public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=33.02s)]
*  Or in this criminal proceeding [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=40.34s)]
*  So as of this ruling Donald Trump is legally restricted from attacking any of the potential witnesses against him in the coup trial [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=42.58s)]
*  This is a big ruling with big implications. We're going to talk all about that shortly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=49.66s)]
*  But one of those witnesses could very well be this man Kenneth Chesbrough [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=53.9s)]
*  unindicted co-conspirator number five in Jack Smith's federal invite meant of Donald Trump and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=59.14s)]
*  Of all the characters in the coup plot and we followed them all [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=64.82s)]
*  Chesbrough may be the most mysterious with the most obscure motives. He also may prove to be one of the most important [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=68.58s)]
*  Kenneth Chesbrough had an unexpected path to plotting Donald Trump's coup [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=75.82s)]
*  He's a graduate of Harvard Law where he worked as a research assistant for the liberal constitutional law scholar Lawrence tribe [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=80.02000000000001s)]
*  He later helped tried represent Al Gore after the 2000 election [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=86.26s)]
*  He was a registered Democrat donated to Democratic candidates, but Chesbrough's political leaning started to shift after he made a fortune [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  investing in cryptocurrency [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  He joined the conservative legal movement representing Republican politicians [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  And he got pulled into the Trump election scheme by the lead attorney for Trump in Wisconsin [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  Who Chesbrough had worked with in recent years? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=108.42s)]
*  Chesbrough became one of the masterminds of the coup plot working in the inner circle with lawyers like John Eastman Rudy Giuliani [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  Who are also indicted in Georgia? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=119.54s)]
*  He devised what became known as the fake electors plot as the January 6 committee explained last summer [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=121.5s)]
*  On November 18th a lawyer working with the Trump campaign named Kenneth [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=129.66s)]
*  Chesbrough wrote a memo arguing that the Trump campaign should organize its own electors in the swing states that President Trump had lost [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=133.73999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Chesbrough wrote to Mayor Giuliani that the vice president is charged with quote [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  Making judgments about what to do if there are conflicting votes close quote [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=147.78s)]
*  Mr. Chesbrough wrote that when the joint session of Congress got to Arizona in the alphabetical list of states the vice president should not count [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=153.38s)]
*  The Biden votes quote because there are two slates of votes [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  That was a big innovation right in this desire and plot to overturn a free and fair election [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=166.34s)]
*  You'll also note that Kenneth Chesbrough was still so obscure a character at that point that no one better pronounce his name properly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=173.34s)]
*  We went back and forth here for like six months [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=179.38s)]
*  We only learned it when he said it himself in front of a Georgia judge in August Chesbrough was one of 19 [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=181.66s)]
*  Codependents indicted in the Georgia election interference case at first [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  He he tried this gambit to basically jam up the prosecution [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=191.94s)]
*  By demanding as was his right under federal law a speedy trial like a real speedy trial in a few months [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  But then just days before that speedy trial was set to begin [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=201.86s)]
*  Chesbrough accepted a plea deal [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=205.86s)]
*  Please lower your hand and state your true and correct legal name Kenneth John Chesbrough [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=208.9s)]
*  Do you understand that this is a negotiated plea which means your attorneys and the state have reached a negotiated recommendation to make to the court [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=213.54s)]
*  I do [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=220.26s)]
*  Chesbrough we all said in the newsroom [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  Chesbrough pleaded guilty to one felony charge. He was sentenced to five years probation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  He was also able crucially as a condition of this plea to keep his law license because of how that crime was [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=228.74s)]
*  Categorized now when Chesbrough pleaded he also agreed to testify against his co-defendants [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=235.22s)]
*  But it was not clear if he had flipped in the way we colloquially understand [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=239.78s)]
*  Was he now going to tell all like Michael Cohen or was this a begrudging move to avoid a worse legal fate? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=244.9s)]
*  Chesbrough's lawyers indicated that it was in fact the latter that Donald Trump had nothing to fear from his client [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=252.06s)]
*  Want to make something clear. He did not implicate anyone else [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=258.7s)]
*  He implicated himself in that particular charge. Someone asked me earlier if you were Donald Trump [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=262.86s)]
*  Would you be worried and I could personally honestly answer no [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=269.22s)]
*  And it's not it's not that mr. Chesbrough is trying to protect Donald Trump or anyone else. He's not he's ready to move on with his life [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=273.22s)]
*  So that sort of seemed to close the book on Chesbrough until late last month when we started hearing about his possible cooperation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=280.98s)]
*  In other inquiries keep in mind among Chesbrough and his 18 co-defendants in Georgia are some of the actual fake electors [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=287.66s)]
*  the people who showed up to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=295.22s)]
*  swear [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=296.86s)]
*  Sign an affidavit saying I am the duly elected elector despite the fact they were not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=298.06s)]
*  Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote in their state. That's what they were claiming, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=303.42s)]
*  Several other states are prosecuting those groups of fake electors as well in these individual states in which they met [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=307.82s)]
*  The state of Michigan charged 16 people in the fake elector scheme in July [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=314.58s)]
*  According to a new report Chesbrough's cooperating with prosecutors in Michigan whose investigation may be broader than previously known [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=319.26s)]
*  We just learned that Chesbrough's also cooperating in Wisconsin indicating that the Attorney General there may also be investigating their fake electors [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=326.74s)]
*  This week 10 Wisconsin Republicans who posed as fake electors [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=334.94000000000005s)]
*  Settled a civil lawsuit not criminal trial civil lawsuit and to settle it they had to acknowledge that Joe Biden did win their state [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=338.86s)]
*  Now we've got criminal investigations also brewing in other states both, Nevada and Arizona [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=346.02000000000004s)]
*  Where Ken Chesbrough has reportedly become a key cooperator in fact [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=351.46s)]
*  He testified before a grand jury in Nevada where six fake electors including the state Republican Party chair were indicted this week [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that Chesbrough is scheduled to meet with investigators in Arizona on Monday [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=363.46s)]
*  So all this really makes you wonder whether Chesbrough actually has flipped in some meaningful sense and what that could mean for Donald Trump who remains [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=369.58s)]
*  in serious legal peril [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=376.7s)]
*  Christy Greenberg serves as federal prosecutor in the southern district of New York where she was deputy chief of the criminal division [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=379.02s)]
*  Jeffrey Tubin is an attorney and legal analyst who studied with Chesbrough at Harvard Law School in the 1980s and I'll start with you [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=383.94s)]
*  Jeffrey because of all the characters here, I feel like I got a good bead on John Eastman [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=388.94s)]
*  I sort of I know Rudy Giuliani has been the public eye for a very long time Chesbrough remains the most mysterious the only person [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=392.78s)]
*  I've ever seen write anything. I'm like, what's the deal with Kenneth Chesbrough is you what's the deal with the correct pronunciation? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=399.24s)]
*  Is the cheese because that's how he was known in law school. It is yes. He's from Wisconsin [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=405.9s)]
*  So this kind of a cheese thing going on there [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=412.26s)]
*  It's a very weird story [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=414.5s)]
*  I mean Ken whom I did know pretty well in law school not hadn't had a lot of context since then I then wrote about him [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=416.26s)]
*  For airmail. He is a very low-key person. He is not someone who seeks a lot of attention [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=422.46s)]
*  He has been an individual appellate lawyer [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=428.52s)]
*  Never with a full law firm in all the years since we graduated from law school [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=431.06s)]
*  But he did go through what seems to be a very consequential midlife crisis a few years ago [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=436.26s)]
*  He got he got divorced from his longtime wife part of a midlife crisis [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=443.86s)]
*  He changed he started investing in crypto made a fortune tried to get Larry tribe his mentor to invest [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=447.66s)]
*  in crypto as well and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=455.86s)]
*  Most significantly as far as we're concerned here went from being a pretty serious Democrat [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=457.46s)]
*  He worked with a lot of plaintiffs lawyers who tend to be Democrats to being a right-wing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  activist big contributor to Ron Johnson the the senator from Wisconsin to President Trump and now [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=469.94s)]
*  a major figure in in this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=477.85999999999996s)]
*  The sham electors it's bizarre. Can I give you the inside? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=481.34s)]
*  Don't [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=487.5s)]
*  I mean it's the classic divorce to crypto to coup. Yeah trajectory. You see so long it happens like crisis [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeFqHIuRFY&t=489.62s)]
