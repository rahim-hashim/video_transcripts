# 'Something to hide': Dems to subpoena megadonors at center of Supreme Court scandals
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY)
*  Do you find this relaxing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=2.56s)]
*  It's away from the sort of the meanness that you see in Washington. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=3.56s)]
*  You get here with just the regular folks and it's so pleasant. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=8.36s)]
*  A big part of the story of Justice Clarence Thomas told by his supporters that this is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  a guy who's gone from growing up in deep poverty in the segregated South to the heights of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=18.04s)]
*  American power without losing sight of who he is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=22.44s)]
*  And one example used to show what a humble and down-to-earth guy he is is that instead [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=26.44s)]
*  of traveling to exotic locales on vacation, he spends his vacations driving an RV, parking [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=30.5s)]
*  in Walmart lots and talking to average Americans. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=36.44s)]
*  Except that we've learned he does go on insanely expensive vacations with his benefactor Harlan [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=40.24s)]
*  Crow, including trips on Crow's yacht, his jet, and to his exclusive Adirondacks Resort. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=45.24s)]
*  And then we also learned from reporting by the New York Times that this man of the people [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  drives a top-of-the-line luxury motorhome that he bought with a loan for the entire [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=55.78s)]
*  purchase price of over a quarter million dollars from another wealthy friend, not Crow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  NBC News has not independently confirmed that report. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=65.14s)]
*  The Senate review then found that this loan for over a quarter of a million dollars was [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=68.26s)]
*  mostly forgiven. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=72.86s)]
*  Senators have also requested more information from Harlan Crow and other benefactors of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=75.22s)]
*  Supreme Court justices, but after getting only limited cooperation, they now plan to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=78.42s)]
*  issue subpoenas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=82.78s)]
*  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island is a member of this Judiciary Committee and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=84.86s)]
*  one of the people leading the push for those subpoenas, and he joins me now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=88.46s)]
*  It's good to have you on, Senator. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  Let's start on the RV home. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=93.1s)]
*  Obviously, Supreme Court justices are people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=95.42s)]
*  They buy property, they buy houses, they get mortgages, they get loans for stuff. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=97.98s)]
*  Fine. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=102.1s)]
*  But a forgiven loan sounds a lot like a gift to me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=103.26s)]
*  Maybe I'm crazy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=107.28s)]
*  Like, what's the judicial ethics code say about loans and forgiven loans in an amount [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=108.28s)]
*  of that size? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=114.64s)]
*  You are not crazy, Chris. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=117.64s)]
*  A forgiven loan. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=119.16s)]
*  In this case, it looks like the entire principle of the loan was forgiven. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=121.6s)]
*  It looks like he only paid interest over a number of years, and then the entire $267,000 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=126.56s)]
*  principle was simply forgiven. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=133.56s)]
*  That amounts to a gift not only for judicial disclosure purposes, but also for federal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=136.32s)]
*  tax purposes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=143.96s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons that the Finance Committee of the Senate, led by Chairman Ron [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=146.28s)]
*  Wyden, was able to dig in and find this information. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=150.96s)]
*  Let's say you were a federal circuit court judge. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=156.04s)]
*  You know, you're on the Ninth Circuit, and you also like to drive a top-of-the-line RV [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=159.96s)]
*  motor home so that you could talk to, quote, average folks, and then that was subsequently [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  forgiven. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=170.28s)]
*  Would you have to report that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=173.16s)]
*  Would that be allowed? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=174.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=175.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=176.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=177.16s)]
*  You would have to report that, and you'd have to report who gave it to you in case a case [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=178.16s)]
*  emerged with that individual so that you could make the appropriate recusal decision in addition [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=182.6s)]
*  to the appropriate disclosure. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=188.28s)]
*  And if you failed to report it, as Justice Thomas failed to report it, you would then [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=191.76s)]
*  be subject to disciplinary proceedings in that circuit, and you'd have to account for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=196.96s)]
*  yourself to your colleagues. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=203.12s)]
*  So we know for a fact he did not report this loan forgiveness. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=205.96s)]
*  We know, just want to be clear, we know for a fact the loan was forgiven, and we know [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=210.32s)]
*  for a fact he did not report the loan being forgiven. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=213.44s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  The evidence that we have obtained in the Senate Finance Committee is that the principle [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=217.8s)]
*  of the loan was forgiven. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=224.68s)]
*  We haven't finally pinned that down, but that's what all of the evidence is, and they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=226.76s)]
*  haven't come forward to rebut that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=230.84s)]
*  And then, of course, there's no reporting of that as an effective gift that should have [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=233.6s)]
*  been reported. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=239.84s)]
*  We've heard news that there's plans now to issue subpoenas, and I think those would be [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=242.56s)]
*  coming out of judiciary, not finance, which is the Ryan Wynes Committee, but rather judiciary, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=247.48s)]
*  also where you sit, and which is chaired by Dick Durbin, if I'm not mistaken, for- [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=251.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=256.56s)]
*  Leonard Leo, who runs the... [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=257.56s)]
*  I don't even know what he runs anymore. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=258.56s)]
*  He runs a million different organizations with a million different names, all nested [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=260.20000000000005s)]
*  within each other in an impenetrable maze. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=264.56s)]
*  So Leonard Leo, Harlan Crowe, the billionaire friend and benefactor, Clarence Thomas, maybe [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  a few others. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=273.8s)]
*  What pushed Senate Democrats' committee leadership over into subpoena territory? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=274.8s)]
*  Well, we were getting non-cooperation from the various individuals that we requested, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=281.92s)]
*  and we were getting non-cooperation that seemed utterly incredible. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  Their theory was that we have absolutely no business conducting any inquiries here, which [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=296.6s)]
*  overlooks the fact that the disclosure statute that's at issue is a statute passed by Congress. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=303.16s)]
*  And the recusal statute that would be triggered by big gifts like this is another statute [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=310.92s)]
*  passed by Congress. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=315.72s)]
*  And the body that implements those two rules is the Judicial Conference, which is an agency [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=317.48s)]
*  created by Congress. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=322.48s)]
*  So their argument is, you, Congress, don't get any oversight over how an agency you, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  Congress, created is implementing laws that you, Congress, passed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=331.92s)]
*  And that's just from me saying it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=337.2s)]
*  You can see that the argument is nonsense. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=338.2s)]
*  And the fact that they were just sticking to it tells me, A, that there's really something [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=340.2s)]
*  to hide there, and B, that we're just going to have to push forward with proper compulsory [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  process. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=350.0s)]
*  That is, I guess, the wording I've seen is may face or planning to issue subpoenas. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=351.0s)]
*  Can you nail that down any further? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=357.4s)]
*  Is that, do I have to talk to Dick Durbin for that? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=358.88s)]
*  How final is this? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=362.08s)]
*  What happened is that on Monday, we gave out the formal notice that a subpoena resolution [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  is going to be on the agenda Thursday. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=372.0s)]
*  And customarily, that's kicked over a week. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=374.96s)]
*  So it will be actually next Thursday. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=376.88s)]
*  And what the resolution does is it authorizes the chairman to issue the subpoena. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  And after that, the chairman can issue at his pleasure and at his convenience and at [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=384.35999999999996s)]
*  the time of his own selection. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=389.44s)]
*  So exactly when we then proceed to the issuance is not determined yet, but the vote should [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=391.8s)]
*  be 10 days from now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=398.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=399.56s)]
*  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=400.56s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NKAncZx7VY&t=401.56s)]
