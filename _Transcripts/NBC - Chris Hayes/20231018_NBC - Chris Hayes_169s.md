**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY)
*  We are connected through humanity and before Wadi was Palestinian, American or a Muslim, he was a human. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=0.0s)]
*  We must rise higher than those people who propagate hatred. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=11.0s)]
*  Our voices must be louder and more powerful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=19.0s)]
*  And together we must strive towards the fundamental American principles of dignity, respect and inclusion for all. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=24.0s)]
*  Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil last night in Plainfield, Illinois to mourn the murder of a six-year-old child, killed, prosecutors say, because he was Palestinian-American. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=34.0s)]
*  A 71-year-old man is now in custody. His wife told police that he, quote, listens to conservative talk radio on a regular basis [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=44.0s)]
*  and has been heavily interested in the events that have recently occurred in Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=52.0s)]
*  Court documents say that Saturday morning he confronted his tenant, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman, berating her over, quote, what was going on in Jerusalem. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=56.0s)]
*  He then attacked her with a knife, injuring her, murdering her son, stabbing the boy 26 times. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=64.0s)]
*  Tensions are high across the country right now with sickening echoes of the months following 9-11. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=70.0s)]
*  A Department of Homeland Security official tells NBC News it is monitoring a, quote, heightened threat environment, but the intensity has gotten worse. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=76.0s)]
*  The NYPD said it is on high alert, ordering officers to report in full uniform for the rest of this week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=82.0s)]
*  In southern Brooklyn last Wednesday, police say a group of attacked three young men as they ate takeout food, shouting F Islam and F Palestine at the victims. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=88.0s)]
*  Just a few miles away that same day, two teens were taken into custody accused of pointing imitation firearms at a Brooklyn synagogue. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=98.0s)]
*  Elsewhere in New York, police are searching for a man accused of attacking a Sikh teenager on a bus and trying to remove his turban. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=106.0s)]
*  While in Ohio, a man was arrested for making anti-Semitic remarks to homeowners with Israeli flags on their lawns. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=113.0s)]
*  And in San Francisco, anti-Semitic messages were left on windows along Market Street. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=120.0s)]
*  In these times of stress and fear, it is, of course, vitally important to remember the real test of any society is to have no tolerance for hatred of any kind, any form, especially as my next guest points out, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=125.0s)]
*  considering that hatred and rage and violence was exactly what Hamas wanted to provoke with the atrocity it carried out in Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=137.0s)]
*  That's next. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=145.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTnr5S8XmY&t=155.0s)]
