# Naive emphasis on 'colorblindness' ignores racial reality in U.S.
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0)
*  We can move forward as a country and embrace the notion that we're all going to be judged not on the color of our skin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  But on the content of our character and in this case on our GPA [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=7.04s)]
*  Am I understanding you saying there in that answer that you do not believe there is racial inequity in the education system in America? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=10.72s)]
*  I just I really don't believe there is I believe there was I mean [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=17.84s)]
*  It's it's there may have been a time when affirmative action was necessary simply to open the doors [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=22.96s)]
*  Of all of our schools and universities, but I think that time has passed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=29.64s)]
*  We'll continue to move forward as a as a colorblind society a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  colorblind [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=38.68s)]
*  Society that concept was the central struggle of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down race conscious admission policies last week [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=39.56s)]
*  Now on the campaign trail and elsewhere the takeaway seems to be we have achieved some kind of colorblind Nirvana [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=46.96s)]
*  That race conscious solutions to systemic social inequities actually disenfranchised white people [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  So we should be race neutral or colorblind like presidential candidate Mike Pence suggests [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=58.32s)]
*  To bolster this argument in the court's majority opinion last week Chief Justice John Roberts cited Jim Crowe era justice [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=64.0s)]
*  John Marshall Harlan a man often called the great dissenter [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=70.72s)]
*  Roberts pointed to a specific section of Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=74.76s)]
*  1896 as a separate but equal case Harlan wrote quote our constitution is colorblind and neither knows nor tolerates [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=80.4s)]
*  classes among citizens and in part for that reason the court found affirmative action in violation of the 14th the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  14th amendment equal protection clause [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=95.76s)]
*  But that Roberts majority opinion happened to skip this part of Harlan's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=98.72s)]
*  1896 dissent right before the colorblind Constitution sentence Harlan writes quote [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=103.68s)]
*  The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=108.36s)]
*  And so it is in prestige and achievements and education and wealth and in power [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=112.4s)]
*  So I doubt not it will continue to be for all time if it remains true to its great heritage [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=124.0s)]
*  colorblind Constitution on one hand and a quote dominant race on the other two diametrically opposed concepts on the same page [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=129.16s)]
*  So this contradiction was actually laid bare in a new Atlantic piece co-authored by Ebram X [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  Kindy author of how to raise an anti-racist and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=142.28s)]
*  Founder of Boston University Center for anti-racist research [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=146.0s)]
*  Dr. Kitty writes quote the colorblind often see their color as superior as Harlan did in the actual world and equal protection clause in a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=149.72s)]
*  Constitution can be transfigured by legal fantasy yet again to protect racial inequity [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=158.04s)]
*  History repeats sometimes without rhyming race neutral is the new separate but equal [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=164.32s)]
*  Then the fantasy was that separate facilities for education afforded to the races were equal and that actions to desegregate them were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=169.68s)]
*  Unnecessary if not harmful today the fantasy is that regular college admissions metrics are race neutral and that affirmative action is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=177.96s)]
*  Unnecessary if not harmful now that racial neutrality is the doctrine of the land as separate [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=186.28s)]
*  But equal was a century ago. We need a new legal movement to expose its fantastical nature [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  Joining us now is dr. Ebram X. Kindy professor and founding director of the Center for anti-racist research at Boston University [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=198.44s)]
*  Dr. Kindy, thank you so much for for being here [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  And I appreciate you writing that piece because I'm trying to make this case to my team over the weekend and they were like [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  Hmm, I don't know. I said well somebody gonna write it and you definitely did [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=213.72s)]
*  Black and Latino students they are still underrepresented in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  many of our country's most selective public universities [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=222.6s)]
*  But the Supreme Court believes that we are ready for a race neutral or even a color-blind approach to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  Admissions that excludes affirmative action you call this illegal fantasy in the Atlantic. Why is it illegal fantasy? I [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Think it's best to contextualize it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=241.6s)]
*  How it was a century ago in which you had [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=244.78s)]
*  those litigants who were trying to desegregate [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=248.82s)]
*  schools who [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=253.5s)]
*  Were going up to the Supreme Court and that Supreme Court was was telling them that these schools were separate but equal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=255.9s)]
*  even though study after study showed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=263.26s)]
*  that black schools receiving far and away less resources from states like Mississippi and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=266.34s)]
*  Georgia and South Carolina then segregated white schools similarly today you you have [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=272.74s)]
*  Supreme Court justices claiming [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=279.18s)]
*  that the only race based admissions factor is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=281.66s)]
*  Affirmative action, but as you've already talked about if you look at legacies that provides [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=286.38s)]
*  Racial preferences for for white students the same thing with for instance children of employees white people are over [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=291.42s)]
*  Represented on the staff and faculty of colleges and universities so that gives preferences to their [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=298.86s)]
*  To their children it also includes white people are more likely to donate to these institutions and and the relatives of donors also get a boost [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=305.98s)]
*  in admissions even standardized tests which primarily show [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=314.26000000000005s)]
*  The wealth or the income of the parents of the test takers and we have a massive racial wealth gap [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=319.22s)]
*  So to me it's it's a fantasy that we have race neutrality other than admit [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=324.82s)]
*  Affirmative action just like it was a fantasy a century ago that the the schools were separate but equal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=330.29999999999995s)]
*  So you write that we need a new legal movement to expose race neutrality neutrality as a fantasy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=336.41999999999996s)]
*  What is the the new legal movement? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=343.02s)]
*  Well, I think it starts with your previous guest who is is actually demonstrating [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=347.14s)]
*  That that legacy is actually not a quote race neutral that it actually gives [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=352.74s)]
*  Preferences to white students and we start to look at some of the other admissions factors [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=358.26s)]
*  That that to demonstrate that they are leading to racial [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=363.06s)]
*  Inequities and and disparities and and I think that's what we have to show we have to demonstrate the outcome [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  Of these policies and be less focused on whether they have racial language or even the intent of the policymaker [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=373.86s)]
*  Well, you talk about the outcome in California and in Michigan [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=380.66s)]
*  Affirmative action was already outlawed for their public universities in the in the 90s and in the early 2000s [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  Actually, so black enrollment at top schools in those two states. They plummeted it was rapidly. I believe it's about 50 percent [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=391.62s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about the broad long-term consequences of that kind of drastic drop in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  representation of students of color in these institutions [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=404.9s)]
*  Well when when black latino and indigenous students are [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=408.1s)]
*  Underrepresented as they are at the top [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=413.3s)]
*  100 most selective institutions that also extends into the graduate programs then they become [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=416.42s)]
*  Underrepresented in the graduate programs and whoever is underrepresented in the graduate programs are also likely to be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  Underrepresented in the professions like like doctors, you know and lawyers or or even [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  On the supreme court and so it sort of filters through throughout society when when when when black and brown and indigenous students are being excluded [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=435.06s)]
*  From college admissions because of the admissions factors [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=443.86s)]
*  You know, it's going to then lead to other elements of society [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=448.26000000000005s)]
*  In the affirmative action ruling the supreme court [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=452.34000000000003s)]
*  Made a carve out an exception if you will for military academies in her dissent justice system [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=455.70000000000005s)]
*  Jackson writes that the majority decided affirmative action was fine if it meant preparing quote [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=460.9s)]
*  Underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker not the boardroom. What do you make of this exception? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean it just goes to show where [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=475.78s)]
*  Particularly black people [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  And other groups of color are accepted [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  So we're accepting that exception [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=485.53999999999996s)]
*  So we're accepting that the other groups of color are accepted so we're excepted when we're putting our lives on the line [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=487.54s)]
*  For the united states, we're we're excepted when we're entertaining people. We're excepted when we're serving people [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=494.34000000000003s)]
*  But for whatever reason we're not excepted when we're trying to be professionals, you know and build wealth like other groups [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  You know [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=507.94s)]
*  It really strikes me that we are having this entire conversation [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=509.14000000000004s)]
*  The supreme court is taking these actions that they have taken [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  in the wake of an attack on teaching our nation's history. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=514.74s)]
*  In schools all across the country, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  there's been a concerted look at critical race theory, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=523.38s)]
*  and I'm using quotes because not actually [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=527.1s)]
*  what is happening in schools across the country, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=530.12s)]
*  books are being banned. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=531.82s)]
*  In the summer that George Floyd was murdered, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=533.98s)]
*  it really seemed like everyone was just, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=537.1s)]
*  your book was flying off the shelf. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=539.7s)]
*  Everybody's trying to figure out how to be anti-racist. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=541.24s)]
*  Companies were hiring DEI, opening up DEI initiatives. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=544.14s)]
*  There were a lot of diversity dollars, as I like to call it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=549.74s)]
*  But three years later, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=552.86s)]
*  many of those initiatives have dried up. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=554.42s)]
*  Your books, for example, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=557.38s)]
*  have been banned in several states actually, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=559.14s)]
*  and now the Supreme Court thinks [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=561.66s)]
*  we have achieved color blindness. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=562.9s)]
*  You've got Republican politicians celebrating it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=564.62s)]
*  What is happening here, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=567.22s)]
*  and are you surprised by how far the pendulum [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=569.66s)]
*  has swung in such short amount of time? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=573.18s)]
*  I think taking the long view of history, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=577.5s)]
*  I'm not surprised, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=579.8599999999999s)]
*  because when we look at American history, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  whenever we have achieved or sought to achieve equity, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=585.06s)]
*  whenever we have put in place anti-racist policies, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=590.7399999999999s)]
*  like affirmative action that have been proven [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=593.7399999999999s)]
*  to close racial disparities in colleges and universities, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=596.8599999999999s)]
*  the typical response historically, like currently, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=601.5s)]
*  is has been that these policies are actually the problem, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=605.34s)]
*  that these policies are somehow anti-white. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=609.34s)]
*  And so you've had this pretty concerted movement [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=613.14s)]
*  to transform anti-racism as the real racism. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=617.14s)]
*  And that's precisely what Jim Crow segregationists did. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=621.86s)]
*  You had enslavers casting abolitionists as the problem, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=625.66s)]
*  and unfortunately, that's still the case today. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=629.58s)]

*  of the Center for Anti-Racist Research at Boston University. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=635.86s)]
*  Appreciate your time tonight, sir. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=638.94s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478PhuhPBZ0&t=641.14s)]
