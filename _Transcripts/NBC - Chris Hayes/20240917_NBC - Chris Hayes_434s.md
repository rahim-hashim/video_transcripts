# Whitmer on whether Harris can win Michigan: 'I'm optimistic, but I'm sober'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk)
*  Donald Trump is in Flint, Michigan, tonight, where he just finished an event they call [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=0.0s)]
*  the town hall, basically just a hosted rally where he only took heavily curated questions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=4.32s)]
*  The person in charge of keeping him on message was his former press secretary, Sarah Huckabee [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=10.64s)]
*  Sanders, who's the governor of Arkansas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=15.48s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=17.64s)]
*  Despite Michigan going for Trump by just over 10,000 votes in 2016, the state has been arguably [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=18.76s)]
*  one of the most successful areas of democratic resurgence in the MAGA era, governed now by [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=23.36s)]
*  a Democratic trifecta since the 2022 midterms. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  At the presidential level, it is still absolutely neck and neck, with recent polls showing what [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=31.84s)]
*  is essentially a dead even race between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=36.0s)]
*  Michigan's Governor Gresham Whitmer has been a big part of the state's resurgent Democratic [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Party. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=45.44s)]
*  Governor Whitmer is also the author of True Gratch, What I've Learned About Life, Leadership, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=46.44s)]
*  and Everything in Between, which is out wherever you get books now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=50.12s)]
*  And she joins me. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  Governor, it's great to have you on the program. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  I guess I'm just going to start with a general vibe check about the state of Michigan, how [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=57.96s)]
*  you feel the campaign is going in that state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=62.78s)]
*  You've got obviously the presidential election, but there's a crucial Senate seat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=65.7s)]
*  It's going to open Senate seat. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin running as the Democratic nominee there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=72.42s)]
*  How do you think things are going? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm optimistic, but I'm sober, Chris. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=77.30000000000001s)]
*  And as I have said, I think the whole time I've been on the political scene in Michigan, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=79.94s)]
*  elections are always close here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=84.42s)]
*  We cannot make any assumptions. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=85.86s)]
*  We take no vote or no voter for granted. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=87.9s)]
*  And that's why I'm really proud to be a co-chair of the Harris campaign, because I know she's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=91.18s)]
*  lived a life like most Michiganders have. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=95.6s)]
*  She wasn't handed a huge inheritance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=98.48s)]
*  She worked her way through school. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=101.26s)]
*  She's done the hard work. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=103.1s)]
*  She's dedicated her life to public service. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=104.62s)]
*  And I think that's why we're seeing energy and enthusiasm, but it's going to be close [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  race. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=111.1s)]
*  I saw a question today that was asked about manufacturing in your state, obviously Michigan, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=112.1s)]
*  a very proud manufacturing history, auto workers, and World War II and things like that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=117.38s)]
*  The question was to former President Trump about what the biggest threat to manufacturing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=124.82s)]
*  was. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  He answered nuclear weapons and then went on a tangent. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=129.45999999999998s)]
*  I didn't quite get it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I guess the idea is like nuclear weapons is a threat to everything, so sure, yeah, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  the greater includes the lesser. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=136.82s)]
*  My question to you is about manufacturing in your state right now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=138.7s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the data, there is more growth in manufacturing investment in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=141.06s)]
*  factory construction that we've seen in literally a generation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=145.82s)]
*  Is that tangible? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=150.78s)]
*  Is it palpable in the state or those numbers for the folks that live there? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=152.82s)]
*  No, it's tangible. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=156.7s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  You can see what has happened because of the Biden-Harris administration and the work they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  did on the Chips Act and the IRA. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  We are seeing onshore supply chains that were so critical to our manufacturing base. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=166.78s)]
*  We're doing a lot of it here in Michigan. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=172.26s)]
*  We do it better than anyone else, and we're out competing the world when it comes to chips [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=173.66s)]
*  and clean energy, batteries, et cetera. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=178.82s)]
*  This is all thanks to, by the way, the Biden-Harris administration, which got it done. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=184.22s)]
*  Donald Trump, I don't know why he's talking about nuclear weapons when it comes to manufacturing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=188.98s)]
*  Maybe he's talking about defense sector. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=193.78s)]
*  I can't figure it out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=195.62s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we know how to get things done. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=196.62s)]
*  We are the heart of manufacturing in this country, and it has a resurgence because of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=204.26s)]
*  And those are good paying jobs, Chris. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=206.42s)]
*  Yeah, there has been a lot of real growth in union jobs in your state. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=208.5s)]
*  I want to ask about something I talked about at the beginning of the show, the Secretary [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=213.06s)]
*  of State of Janet Griswold in Colorado. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=217.1s)]
*  Obviously, your state of Michigan has dealt with both attempts to subvert the election, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=218.98s)]
*  either through the sort of kind of bullying election officials. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  There was a plot specifically against you and your life. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=229.82s)]
*  There's attempts to get fake electors to intimidate Wayne County vote tabulation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=233.94s)]
*  What does it mean for your state, the ex-president's threatening prosecution and reprisals against [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=241.38s)]
*  his political enemies? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  And how confident are you about the integrity of the system you have in Michigan? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's the same old line from the same old guy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=253.62s)]
*  He runs on grievance. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=258.3s)]
*  He offers nothing to make Michiganders' lives better or Americans' lives better. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=259.42s)]
*  Contrast that with Kamala Harris, who is focusing on putting more money back in Americans' [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=264.46s)]
*  pockets, making sure that every American has a path to prosperity. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=269.06s)]
*  When you actually listen to the words that Donald Trump says, they, number one, don't [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  make a whole lot of sense, and number two, are never focused on the American people, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=277.1s)]
*  are never focused on making your life better. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=281.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has dedicated her life to public service, wants to put more [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  money in your pocket, bring down the cost of insulin, ensure we've got good paying [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=289.18s)]
*  jobs and that more people can get into them because they got the skills they need without [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=293.82000000000005s)]
*  a lifetime of debt that can come with it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  So I feel good about that, but I do think that his rhetoric is dangerous. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=300.18s)]
*  I've been calling for people to lower the temperature on rhetoric for years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  He has stoked it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  It has made a very dangerous situation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=311.14000000000004s)]
*  It's not OK to only call it out when it turns on you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=313.5s)]
*  We've got to all stand against this, this ugliness that has become a regular part of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=316.38000000000005s)]
*  political campaigns where people threaten their political opponents and can threaten [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  their lives at the same time, and it's unacceptable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=325.54s)]
*  You became governor, you were elected in 2018, you took over in 2019. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  You had to, as a new governor, deal with COVID, both the public health aspects of that, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=335.36s)]
*  the politics of it, the economic aspects of it, and then the aftermath of it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=342.6s)]
*  What do you what do you learn about the trajectory? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  And are you optimistic that that we have the country have learned something as we've gone [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=351.76s)]
*  through these last, say, five years? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=359.36s)]
*  I am optimistic. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=363.32s)]
*  Chris, I wrote the book True Grudge because people ask me that question. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=364.4s)]
*  How do you stay optimistic? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=368.48s)]
*  Why do you want to keep doing this with 28 recall attempts and historic flooding and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=369.48s)]
*  a pandemic and attempt to kidnap and to kill you? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=374.56s)]
*  Why do you want to keep doing this work? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=378.94s)]
*  And there are good things that I've learned in my life that keep me focused and centered. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=380.6s)]
*  And I am optimistic. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=385.12s)]
*  I'm sober, though. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=386.48s)]
*  We've got a lot of work to do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=387.48s)]
*  There is no question that this is going to be a close election with high stakes, whether [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=389.12s)]
*  it's our individual ability to make our own decisions about our bodies or our ability [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=392.76000000000005s)]
*  to ensure that our kids have got a climate that will sustain their lives and livelihoods [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=397.56s)]
*  for generations to come. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  And so I'm optimistic, but I'm sober. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=404.76000000000005s)]
*  And I'm that's why I'm doing the work. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, thank you so much for making some time for us tonight. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3fnBfKFDk&t=409.84000000000003s)]
