# Georgia journalist who observed fake electors subpoenaed in Trump case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU)
*  Joining me now is Tamar Harleman, senior reporter with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=5.14s)]
*  D.A. Willis says her team is ready to go, as we just heard her say. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=6.8s)]
*  August, of course, begins tomorrow. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=10.24s)]
*  Do we have any indication to give us any more precise idea on timing? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=12.36s)]
*  Well, we actually just got a little bit in the last hour or so. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=16.48s)]
*  George Chidi, who's an independent journalist down here in Georgia, confirmed that he got [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=20.84s)]
*  a subpoena to come testify before both of the regular grand juries that are meeting [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=26.36s)]
*  here in August and are expected to hear potential Trump-related charges. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=31.96s)]
*  And his subpoena date says anywhere between August 7th and August 31st. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=37.04s)]
*  So that means we're not expecting potential indictments this week, but we could see it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=42.82s)]
*  next week, the week after, and potentially even later into August. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=46.84s)]
*  And Tamar, while we're on that, just quickly, what is his role or alleged role in this Georgia story? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=52.12s)]
*  George Chidi stumbled upon the meeting of alternate Republican electors at the state [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=59.32s)]
*  Capitol here in Georgia in mid-December of 2020. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=63.8s)]
*  He was there waiting to observe the regular Democratic electors who were scheduled to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=68.0s)]
*  go at noon, but he saw some Republicans he knew walk into a room and he thought, OK, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=74.4s)]
*  that's interesting. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  He tried to enter the room. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  He was recording on his phone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  He was booted out and told that it was an educational meeting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=83.0s)]
*  And of course, we find out later that that was the meeting of the Republican Trump electors [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=87.08s)]
*  who did end up opening the meeting to the public so people could record. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  But his testimony could be very crucial, especially since it looks like the DA is still very interested [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=97.48s)]
*  in who organized and participated in this meeting of the electors. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  A very educational meeting. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Tamar, I understand that cameras are allowed in Georgia state courtrooms. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  So let me just clarify this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  If Donald Trump is arraigned in Fulton County, it will likely be on video. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of that depends on the judge who's going to be overseeing the case that day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=121.0s)]
*  So we have to file the special paperwork if we want to shoot cameras or record audio in a court room. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=126.04s)]
*  So far, we haven't encountered any problems with that under Judge McBurney as we've gone [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=131.84s)]
*  through the investigative part of all of this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=136.28s)]
*  Although we don't know who the judge is going to be, should Trump or others be indicted [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=138.56s)]
*  in Fulton County? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  And it all depends on them and what they see. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  And of course, the Secret Service will be involved in any sort of negotiations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=145.84s)]
*  Should Trump himself be indicted? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  And of course, they don't want to do anything to put the former president in harm's way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=151.44s)]
*  So perhaps they'll make a push to not have this be televised. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=156.24s)]
*  I feel like if Donald Trump has televised arraigned, a lot of our viewers are doing a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  Stephen Colbert popcorn gif right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=165.96s)]
*  Today, Tamar, you reported on a ruling from the judge on a motion by Trump's team to quote, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=169.56s)]
*  gut the Fulton County District Attorney's investigation of interference in Georgia's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=174.32s)]
*  2020 presidential election. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=178.72s)]
*  What was the motion and how did the judge rule? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=180.36s)]
*  This was a long time coming. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  The former president's lawyer submitted a motion back in March that sought to not only [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=186.0s)]
*  disqualify D.A. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  Willis from continuing the investigation, they sought to remove Judge McBurney, who's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  been overseeing this entire process. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=195.76s)]
*  They wanted to kill the final report of the special grand jury that helped compile evidence [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=197.88s)]
*  for the D.A. and suppress any of the evidence that they had pulled together during their [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  term. So they really tried to throw the kitchen sink at all of this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=207.32s)]
*  The judge smacked them down after we waited a couple of months for this ruling. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=211.72s)]
*  There is a question about whether there will be an appeal, especially before we expect [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=216.72s)]
*  the D.A. to seek indictments. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  And there is a hearing scheduled next week with a different judge. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=223.72s)]
*  Trump's attorneys recently tried to go over Judge McBurney's head to try and get him to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=227.84s)]
*  rule. And that hearing is on the books for next week. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=232.4s)]
*  We'll still see if that's going to happen, although it's seeming less likely, especially [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=235.6s)]
*  if Mr. Trump's lawyers appeal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=240.0s)]
*  One last question tomorrow. A lot of this has been playing out publicly from D.A. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=243.32s)]
*  Willis's interview with NBC correspondent Blaine Alexander, where she reinforced the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=246.32s)]
*  seriousness of the inquiry to the released portion of the special grand jury report, to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=250.48s)]
*  the grand jury instructions that were recently broadcast. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=254.48s)]
*  We just saw Willis speaking over the weekend. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=257.28s)]
*  Could this be a model for other prosecutors, particularly as they pursue cases against [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump, that this level of transparency works? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  Potentially. And it is something that you see Trump and other folks who are targeted [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=268.0s)]
*  in this investigation. We've heard them complaining a lot about it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=273.08s)]
*  You see it often in legal filings, this very Trump motion today that the judge ruled on. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=276.24s)]
*  One of the arguments they were making for disqualifying the D.A. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=280.76s)]
*  from the investigation was because D.A. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=283.84s)]
*  Willis has been so out front, at least explaining her process and that she was looking for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=286.28s)]
*  justice. They argued that it compromised the probe. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  The judge said, no, I don't think so. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=293.84s)]
*  But he did mention how it is a different level of not transparency, but just openness that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=296.36s)]
*  we don't typically see with. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWi5sqUpmU&t=302.52s)]
