# Hayes: Biden delivering on 2020 promises makes for a strong 2024 pitch
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY)
*  One of the things that I hear some of you guys saying is, why doesn't Biden say what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=0.0s)]
*  a good deal it is? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=7.2s)]
*  Why would Biden say what a good deal is before the vote? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=8.2s)]
*  You think that's going to help me get a pass? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  That's why you guys don't bargain very well. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  President Biden took a small victory lap yesterday after securing a deal to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=18.2s)]
*  But as you just heard him mention there, it's probably beneficial to not draw much attention [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=23.8s)]
*  to it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  You see, there's been this strange feature of the Biden presidency where he intentionally, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=29.68s)]
*  I think, doesn't command attention or really wield the bully pulpit like either of his [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=34.04s)]
*  two predecessors did. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=38.599999999999994s)]
*  It was actually a core premise of Biden's pitch back in the 2020 campaign, I think both [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=40.12s)]
*  in the primary and the general election. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=45.44s)]
*  Candidate Biden promised a return to normalcy after the in-your-face, torturously attention-seeking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=47.28s)]
*  presidency of Donald Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=54.099999999999994s)]
*  I think most people believed Biden could accomplish that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  There's another pillar of his candidacy, too, that was a little more difficult to envision. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=59.32s)]
*  Biden pledged to return the country to a bygone era of partisan dealmaking, the kind of which [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=64.32s)]
*  he spent decades negotiating in the Senate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=70.2s)]
*  I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is if I were to run for president, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=73.2s)]
*  I like Republicans. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, bless me, Father, if I have sinned. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=82.48s)]
*  But, you know, from where I come from, I don't know how you get anything done. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=85.48s)]
*  I don't know how you get anything done until we start talking to one another again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=96.48s)]
*  Now, I have to say, personally, I was pretty skeptical of that line. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=100.48s)]
*  But it's true that Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=105.48s)]
*  Reduction Act, were passed along party lines in face Republican opposition. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=111.0s)]
*  Those were progressive priorities, and they didn't get a single Republican vote, at least [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=115.72s)]
*  not in the Senate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=119.2s)]
*  If you check the larger legislative record, however, the president has quietly, or not [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=120.68s)]
*  so quietly, racked up quite a few bipartisan accomplishments. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=126.2s)]
*  In addition to this latest deal, which it looks like will pass, Biden also signed the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=129.88s)]
*  CHIPS bill, which invests in American tech manufacturing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=134.2s)]
*  There's the bipartisan infrastructure bill to spend money and invest in roads and bridges, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=137.24s)]
*  broadband, lead pipe replacement, among other projects. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=142.0s)]
*  There's the first meaningful piece of gun safety legislation to pass Congress in nearly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  three decades. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=149.36s)]
*  There's the legal codification of gay marriage, all of which got the requisite votes to overcome [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=151.4s)]
*  a Republican filibuster. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Bipartisan bills. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=157.72s)]
*  Now, listen, most of those bills are, in my opinion, far from perfect. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=158.72s)]
*  Republican negotiators specifically, and some Democrats, made them all meaningfully [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=163.96s)]
*  worse in some way. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=167.68s)]
*  But they're still tangible legislative accomplishments, and crucially, they, again, from a kind of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=169.68s)]
*  political perspective, they all fall in the zone of normal politics in a way that, say, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=174.12s)]
*  storming the Capitol doesn't. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=179.8s)]
*  So I really do think it is fair to say that Biden has delivered in many respects on those [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=182.52s)]
*  two key promises of his campaign, this sort of return to normalcy and return to a president [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=186.8s)]
*  who doesn't sort of torture you by commanding your attention every day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=192.78s)]
*  Now, with that in mind, he faces major hurdles in his 2024 reelection campaign. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=196.9s)]
*  The first is his age. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=202.62s)]
*  If he wins the second term, President Biden will be 86 years old by the time he leaves [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=204.14s)]
*  office. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=207.86s)]
*  Frankly, there's nothing he or anyone else can do about that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=208.86s)]
*  It just quite literally is what it is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=211.22s)]
*  But the other major obstacles Biden faces over the next 18 months stem from the fact [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=214.38s)]
*  that he took over a country reeling from a series of cascading crises in the aftermath [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=219.34s)]
*  of the COVID pandemic. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=223.82s)]
*  I mean, there really have been just enormously painful dislocations to all of American life [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=224.82s)]
*  under his watch. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=232.02s)]
*  The two most obvious examples are violent crime, which went up quite a bit both in 2020 [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=234.68s)]
*  under President Trump and 2021, and inflation, which hit the highest level in 40 years last [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=239.3s)]
*  year and ate into people's disposable incomes and their wages in a very real way. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  Now, to be clear, Biden was not responsible for those two things happening. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  But if you're an incumbent president, you're just going to get blamed for issues like crime [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  and inflation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=258.78s)]
*  That said, there's actually some remarkable developments on both those fronts, neither [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=259.78s)]
*  of which are getting much coverage. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=264.18s)]
*  Inflation is dropping steadily. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=267.02s)]
*  It's likely due to a confluence of factors, including interest rate hikes from the Fed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=268.97999999999996s)]
*  More importantly, in my mind, the continuing recovery from COVID disruptions, which have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=273.5s)]
*  taken a very long time to unwind. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=277.38s)]
*  In line with that, we're also seeing an economy that is truly delivering for working Americans [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=280.32s)]
*  at the bottom of the labor hierarchy for the first time in recent memory. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=285.32s)]
*  This is a pretty striking story. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=289.32s)]
*  We have seen actual meaningful wage gains for the bottom portion of workers, even when [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=292.26s)]
*  you account for inflation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=297.08s)]
*  Whether that continues or not is anyone's guess, but that trajectory is promising. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=299.66s)]
*  Then there's the question of crime and violence. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=305.66s)]
*  There's no denying that this nation is still utterly beset by gun violence in a way that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=307.86s)]
*  no pure nation is, due in large part to the hundreds of millions of guns in people's hands. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=312.38000000000005s)]
*  Painful reminder this weekend. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  Over the holiday, 16 people were killed, dozens more injured in 17 mass shootings across the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  country, a problem that persists largely due to Republicans' commitment to an increasingly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=325.74s)]
*  dangerous form of gun maximalism and fetishism. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=330.18s)]
*  In fact, one report from Everytown for Gun Safety found that most of us probably already [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=333.94s)]
*  believe to be true, the 14 red or purple states with the weakest gun laws in the country have [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=338.98s)]
*  nearly triple the rate of gun deaths of the eight blue states with the strictest laws. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=344.06s)]
*  Even with that said, if you take a step back and you look at the numbers in the aggregate, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  the levels of violence in America are definitely moving in the right direction. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=353.66s)]
*  They're not going to talk about this on Fox News, but it's true. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  National crime data is a lagging indicator, but we do know that violent crime dropped [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=362.56s)]
*  nationwide last year. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=366.38000000000005s)]
*  When it comes to homicide, the most serious form of violent crime, murder rates are down [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=368.06s)]
*  in big cities across the country, from New York to, yes, Chicago and Los Angeles. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=372.94000000000005s)]
*  Ultimately, Joe Biden's reelection pitch is going to be a story about a country recovering [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=380.26s)]
*  from an almost unthinkable set of unprecedented disruptions from a once in a century pandemic [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=384.73999999999995s)]
*  to Donald Trump's attempted coup. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=390.17999999999995s)]
*  And to the extent that a return to normalcy was the promise of his 2020 victory, I think [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=392.7s)]
*  if these trends continue, President Biden has a much stronger political narrative in 2024. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3X7ZHlp3SY&t=397.82s)]
