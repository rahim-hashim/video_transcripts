# ‘Cover-up’ New details in Trump indictment have shades of Watergate
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI)
*  So if you read through the new details of the special counsel's superseding indictment in the classified documents case, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=0.0s)]
*  so much of it sounds like something of a mob movie. I recommend going straight to pages 28 and 29 for that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=6.0s)]
*  After grand jury subpoenaed security camera footage from Mar-a-Lago, including from the basement where Donald Trump stashed boxes of highly sensitive government documents, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=12.5s)]
*  Trump asked to meet with his loyal aide, Walt Natta. Soon, Natta was changing his travel plans to head to Mar-a-Lago, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=20.5s)]
*  where he met with another Trump employee, Carlos de Oliveira. De Oliveira then goes into a closet with a fellow employee who works in I.T. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=27.0s)]
*  where he told him that, quote, the boss wanted the server for the security camera footage deleted. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=35.0s)]
*  When the other employee responds that he would not know how to do that, totally fair, de Oliveira insisted that, quote, the boss wanted the server deleted and asked, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=40.0s)]
*  What are we going to do? That sounds very mobby to me. It calls to mind the kind of juicy cover up details that led to the downfall of another president, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=49.0s)]
*  Richard Nixon. You might remember that Nixon ultimately resigned after the smoking gun taper was released, where he was heard discussing plans to cover up the break-in at the Watergate Hotel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=58.0s)]
*  But at least Nixon had the good sense to try to insulate himself from the burglars who broke into the DNC headquarters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=68.0s)]
*  He did not call them directly and ask them for status updates, at least. For more on this historical perspective, let's turn to Douglas Brinkley. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=75.0s)]
*  He's a presidential historian, a professor of history at Rice University, and the author of numerous books, including two on the Nixon tape. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=81.0s)]
*  So I just made a comparison there, Doug, but I want to ask you, you're the historian. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=89.0s)]
*  How would you compare Trump's alleged behavior in this superseding indictment to Nixon and the Watergate scandal? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=94.0s)]
*  Donald Trump defines what a being, you know, a bad operator is. Nixon had a patriotic side to him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=102.0s)]
*  He served in World War II. He did a lot of good things as president in foreign affairs, forced the China trip in 1972. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=112.0s)]
*  And, you know, in something like, look at Trump's very George Wallace-like, and Nixon was for affirmative action. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=120.0s)]
*  Nixon created the EPA. I don't want to rehabilitate Richard Nixon, but Nixon did the right thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=127.0s)]
*  He resigned. He recognized if he stayed and fought impeachment, it would destroy the Republican Party for a generation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=133.0s)]
*  It would do damage to the United States. There's no sign that Nixon ever would have gone around willy-nilly showing people, you know, top security clearance documents like [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=139.0s)]
*  Donald Trump did, contingency plans for wars or anything like this. So Nixon's the only person I know that's coming out better because of these recent allegations this week. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=150.0s)]
*  But remember, it wasn't just Nixon's tapes. It was the erasing of the tapes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=162.0s)]
*  So Rosemary Woods, secretary, erased 18 and a half minutes, and we now saw Donald Trump trying to get do away with videotape. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=168.0s)]
*  Yes, the tapes is the theme. So, OK, if Richard Nixon and Donald Trump, not exact comparison, because all the reasons you just outlined, you have compared Trump or said he fits into the American narrative of some outlaw folk heroes like Al Capone, Don Jellinger and Billy the Kid. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=176.0s)]
*  Lay that out for us. Yeah, I mean, Trump's really is a gangster. He's he's like a mafioso. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=193.0s)]
*  And those are the people he grew up with. Roy Cohen was his lawyer. He would deal with them, you know, 15, 20 times a day in the 1980s. It was his hero. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=200.0s)]
*  These guys were shameless, reckless. You know, there was no law. They wouldn't try to circumvent. They always denied everything. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=210.0s)]
*  And so Trump's of that ilk. And, you know, yet sometimes in America, however, there's all the other presidents, including Nixon and Donald Trump on his island by himself. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=218.0s)]
*  And Trump really reflects this outlaw tradition. America people sometimes like the guy with the middle finger telling everybody off the rules don't apply to me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=228.0s)]
*  But that only lasts for so long. And I think at last, as Kamala Harris said, the news is tightening on Donald Trump. And it seems to me that every week he's getting closer to his ultimate comeuppance. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=238.0s)]
*  Now, you've been watching Donald Trump for a long time. You've been following presidents for even longer. What do you think could prompt him to step back or not continue to claim he did nothing wrong, if anything? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=252.0s)]
*  I don't think anything. I think it's about eating up the clock, running and winning. And if he wins, he feels all those problems will be erased. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=266.0s)]
*  Otherwise, he's going to have to start asking for favors from whoever other Republicans are, Rick DeSantis or somebody. That's that's not going to happen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=276.0s)]
*  So I have a feeling Donald Trump's in this to the bitter end, even if he's in a jail cell. He will try to keep running because he'll never admit he lost. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=285.0s)]
*  Nixon had won the biggest election landslide in 1972. He legitimately was a two term president. Donald Trump is a loser. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=294.0s)]
*  He won one term and lost, yet he's willing to take the Republican Party and the country down with him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=303.0s)]
*  So as we are all discussing this in the months ahead, we should maybe compare him less to Nixon as much as we often do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=309.0s)]
*  Is there any moment in any other president's life career that you would compare the events of the last several years to or even months? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=316.0s)]
*  Well, I think Nixon had the silent majority right. And what Donald Trump has the mega mega phone. They're not silent anymore. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=325.0s)]
*  But it's by and large, it's a very large hunk of the country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=332.0s)]
*  Trump very astutely connected the anti NAFTA Ross Perot vote of 1992 with the George Wallace segregationist vote with some of the Richard Nixon law and order with advice from Roy Cohen. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=336.0s)]
*  You can do a composite portrait of Donald Trump, but in the end, he is a weird one offer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=348.0s)]
*  He's somebody whose ego is so large that it's hard to put it in anything but terms of a psychiatrist. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=354.0s)]
*  And you really have to look abroad at dictators to compare Trump to authoritarian figures, perhaps characters like you along in American history. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=363.0s)]
*  Joe McCarthy. But alas, you along with Joe McCarthy never were in the White House. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=372.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump was. I want to end on a positive note here because it is a Friday evening at the end of a long week. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=376.0s)]
*  We often say that our democracy is under threat and at risk. And it's important to remind people of that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=383.0s)]
*  But are there moments in history that we should look to as moments where democracy was challenged in our country and we overcame it? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=388.0s)]
*  Well, certainly. I mean, I always tell students to remember the point of history as our own times aren't uniquely oppressive. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=395.0s)]
*  Anybody who studies something like the Civil War, even though it went on in our country during the Vietnam era on 58000 servicemen dead while we were mired in Southeast Asia, we've seen it worse. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=403.0s)]
*  But there is a feeling that our institutions are dissolving. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=415.0s)]
*  Washington, D.C. is as most dysfunctional as it's really been since the 1850s period. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=419.0s)]
*  And that's frightening. But, you know, we everybody talks about Trump a lot. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=426.0s)]
*  He eats up a lot of oxygen, but we may be living in the age of Joe Biden. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=430.0s)]
*  Imagine if Biden beats Donald Trump as a two term president, somebody who warded off Trump ism will be looking at Biden's record. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=433.0s)]
*  Very different if he if he indeed is a two term. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQescGdPJZI&t=441.0s)]
