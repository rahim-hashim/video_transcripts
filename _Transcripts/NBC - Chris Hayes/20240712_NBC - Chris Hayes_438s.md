# ‘Trump is a loser!’: Biden focuses on ‘envy of the world’ American economy roaring back
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw)
*  Michigan, which is the state the president just gave that speech in, is, of course, a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=0.0s)]
*  state that he won four years ago. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=3.52s)]
*  It is clearly a must-win again in November to have a chance of defeating Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=5.24s)]
*  And the president made clear that that is his plan tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of speculation lately. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  What's Joe Biden going to do? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=17.36s)]
*  Is he going to stay in the race? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=18.36s)]
*  Is he going to drop out? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=19.36s)]
*  Where's my answer? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=20.36s)]
*  I am running, and we're going to win. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=21.36s)]
*  I'm not going to change that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=22.36s)]
*  I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=23.36s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=24.36s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=25.36s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=26.36s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=27.36s)]
*  I'm going to win. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=28.36s)]
*  I'm the Democratic Party, the only Democrat or Republican who hasn't beaten Donald Trump [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=29.72s)]
*  ever. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=33.24s)]
*  And I'm going to beat him again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=34.24s)]
*  I know him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=35.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is a loser. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=36.24s)]
*  That speech happening this evening on a very packed day for the president earlier in the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=41.24s)]
*  day on a tense call with congressional Democrats. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=51.8s)]
*  He said, I'm not going, I'm going to go out, let people touch me, poke me, ask me questions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=53.8s)]
*  Today, as he got back into retail politicking, there were flashes of Joe Biden, the veteran [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=59.32s)]
*  campaigner. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  My dad used to say, Joey, your job is about a lot more than a paycheck. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=64.4s)]
*  It's about your dignity. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  It's about respect. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be okay [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  and mean it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=74.08s)]
*  And that's what it's all about. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=75.08000000000001s)]
*  A large part of the case that the president's been making to voters, as he did last night [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  in that press conference, is pretty straightforward. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=81.64s)]
*  It goes like this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=84.12s)]
*  Let's look at how the American economy has roared back since he took the reins during [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  the aftermath of COVID, a recession and a supply crisis. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  We made so much progress. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=94.84s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=96.92s)]
*  Think about what we are economically relative to the rest of the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=98.28s)]
*  Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  We've created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs, 1.5 million jobs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, so things are moving. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=110.56s)]
*  And he's not wrong. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  For months, experts have been calling the U.S. economy — these are not partisan folks, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  these are just people that analyze this stuff for a living — calling the U.S. economy [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  the envy of the world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=121.64s)]
*  It's grown at a far faster rate than any other large developed economy on Earth. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=122.8s)]
*  In fact, the World Bank last month not only said that the Biden-era American economy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=128.08s)]
*  was the world's strongest, which it is, it also concluded that the entire global economy [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=131.88s)]
*  is in better shape because of the strength of the American recovery. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=136.28s)]
*  There's huge spillover effects because the U.S. has been a kind of tentpole for global [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=140.12s)]
*  post-COVID recovery. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  When you consider where we stood in 2020, Biden's tenure has been the most successful [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  macroeconomic stewardship of any president in my lifetime. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=151.56s)]
*  And many of those economic successes have come through in headlines in just the past [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=155.28s)]
*  three weeks, though, of course, you may have missed them for some reason. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  Just yesterday, new government data showed that inflation was cooling beyond almost all [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  economists' expectations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=166.76s)]
*  Prices on everything from cars to groceries are down. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=168.04s)]
*  Rent, crucially, which has been a real source of pain for people and growing really quickly, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=171.16s)]
*  is finally stabilizing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=176.68s)]
*  Rent is finally staleing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=178.44s)]
*  For the first time in four years, overall prices are down last month on a month-to-month [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=179.88s)]
*  basis, not rising at its lower eclipsed, but actually declining. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=184.8s)]
*  The Fed now might even cut interest rates before the election. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=188.68s)]
*  A few days earlier, a study highlighted by The New York Times concluded that America's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=192.36s)]
*  so-called left behind counties, the once great manufacturing centers and other distressed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=195.64s)]
*  places that struggled mightily at the start of the century, have staged a remarkable comeback. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  In the last three years, they added jobs and new businesses at their fastest pace since [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  Bill Clinton was president. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=210.32s)]
*  So the economic growth is not just helping big cities, it's not just helping urban professionals. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=212.72s)]
*  In regions like Bay County, Michigan, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, where President Biden [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=217.0s)]
*  was born, the job markets are strong. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=220.92s)]
*  Prices are up in real terms. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=223.92s)]
*  And today, markets rally, with all three major stock indexes closing near their all-time [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=226.2s)]
*  highs. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=230.32s)]
*  And much of this is thanks to Joe Biden, the president, and his economic policy agenda, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=232.0s)]
*  a man who entered office facing a really difficult situation and a whole bunch of hard choices. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  The Biden White House has not just addressed cyclical concerns, like the high unemployment [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=242.84s)]
*  when they took over during COVID and the subsequent inflation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=247.64s)]
*  It's actually moved America away from the worst excesses of the economic model that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=251.0s)]
*  dominated for decades, a model that was based on low-wage work, huge outsourcing, and gutting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=256.92s)]
*  the American manufacturing base. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=263.52s)]
*  Biden has improved on all of those. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  Inequality has shrunk, wages at the bottom are up the most. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=267.8s)]
*  He's also been building towards a green transition in heavy industry. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=270.56s)]
*  All of this is a record, like I said, it's the best economic management of any president [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=274.6s)]
*  in my lifetime. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=278.04s)]
*  It's a record to just to be proud of. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=279.24s)]
*  And it has been an enduring obsession of mine and this show that the Biden presidency has [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=282.0s)]
*  delivered all of this and his approval rating hovers around 37%. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=286.36s)]
*  That's not a good number. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  That's on par with Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, who both lost their reelection [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=292.92s)]
*  bids, but crucially, who are presiding over very weak economies. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=296.6s)]
*  They had nowhere near as strong a record on the merits to run on as Biden does. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=301.14s)]
*  And so what's the deal? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=307.48s)]
*  There's a lot of things we've talked about on the show. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=309.92s)]
*  There is one seemingly straightforward explanation, which is that a lot of people, roughly two-thirds [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=311.92s)]
*  of voters in recent polls, think that Biden is too old to serve another term as president. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=315.76s)]
*  That acts as a kind of anchor. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  And that perception colors everything. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=322.44s)]
*  And it explains in some ways why so many Democrats are so worried about Biden at the top of the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=324.72s)]
*  ticket. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=329.72s)]
*  They basically reason that if you have this kind of record as a president and you're still [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=330.72s)]
*  down the polls, is there any hope? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=334.32s)]
*  And the irony, of course, is that this exact same set of facts also explains Biden's perspective, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=338.28s)]
*  where he says, look, I have a unique set of skills I brought to bear on the presidency, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=345.28s)]
*  50 years of experience. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=350.12s)]
*  I've accomplished a whole bunch of things that no one said we could get done that would [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  have been difficult for anyone else to accomplish, but I didn't to the fact that I've literally [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=355.88s)]
*  been doing it for 52 years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=359.2s)]
*  In fact, he said as much in that press conference last night. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=361.28s)]
*  What I realized was my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom on how [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=365.23999999999995s)]
*  to deal with the Congress, to get things done. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=372.88s)]
*  We got more major legislation passed that no one thought would happen. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=376.11999999999995s)]
*  And I want to finish it, to get that finished. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=381.0s)]
*  So that is the conundrum in a nutshell. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=385.28s)]
*  At least it's the challenge, if nothing else. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  The president has been good at governing, at getting legislation done on economic management [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=390.12s)]
*  and stewardship and leadership, in part, I think, because he has more experience than [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  anyone else. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=399.04s)]
*  And but also, his advance age is also his biggest political liability, even against [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_i-B3HfCw&t=400.76000000000005s)]
