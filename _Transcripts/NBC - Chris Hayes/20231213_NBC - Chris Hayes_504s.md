# GOP rep admits Biden impeachment is about ‘Trump 2024, baby’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. About two hours ago, the Republican controlled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=0.0s)]
*  House of Representatives voted to formally open an impeachment inquiry into President [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=4.16s)]
*  Joe Biden by a narrow nine vote margin entirely along party lines. Every single Republican [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=8.88s)]
*  voter to start the impeachment process over, well, it's not really clear. No one seems [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=15.56s)]
*  sure what exactly the charge is. And to be clear, the bar for productive discourse out [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=22.12s)]
*  of this historically unproductive Republican majority is as low as it gets. I mean, this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=27.74s)]
*  is the same House Republican majority that took 15 votes just to elect a speaker of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=32.42s)]
*  the House. The same Republican majority that fired that guy after only a few months on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=36.26s)]
*  the job and left the country without a speaker second aligned the presidency for three more [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=40.3s)]
*  weeks. The same Republican majority that is constantly at risk of being torn asunder by [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=44.459999999999994s)]
*  internal strife led by extremists and political nihilists with cultish devotion to the man [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=48.92s)]
*  who tried to destroy American democracy and is promising to do it again. But even by that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=54.54s)]
*  low, low standard, this impeachment inquiry is as transparently cynical as anything they've [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=60.18s)]
*  done yet. They've been at this for nearly three years. I mean, from the moment President [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  Biden was sworn in, they were waiting to impeach him. The facts could come later. Here's the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  thing about many House Republicans. It's important to understand they are just as adrift in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=76.18s)]
*  conspiracy fever swamp as the most extreme portions of the MAGA movement they represent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=81.22s)]
*  So over the past couple of years, I think a bunch of them convinced themselves that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=86.22s)]
*  there really was some big smoking gun that would prove that Joe Biden was guilty of grifting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  money from foreign governments, which I think is the charge of the again, not clear. Joe [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  Biden, a man who really quite famously was among the poorest men in all of elected government, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=100.7s)]
*  at a fair level for most of his tenure in Washington. That is the guy who they want [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=106.78s)]
*  you to believe was not just corrupt, but like wildly, unprecedentedly corrupt in front of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=111.74s)]
*  everyone's faces while serving as vice president. And no one, no one sniffed it out until now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=118.06s)]
*  That's the story. That claim, I think it's fair to say, is astonishingly difficult to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=124.66s)]
*  believe, which is why Republicans have zeroed in on Biden's son, Hunter. That's a man who [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=130.9s)]
*  has very publicly struggled with addiction and dysfunction for most of his adult life. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=136.46s)]
*  House Republicans have hounded the president's son, Hunter Biden, to the ends of the earth [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=142.46s)]
*  for years. And so he actually showed up to Washington today to make his case for himself. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=146.94s)]
*  I am here to testify at a public hearing today to answer any of the committee's legitimate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=154.3s)]
*  questions. Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=159.78s)]
*  expose their baseless inquiry, or hear what I have to say. What are they afraid of? I'm [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=171.58s)]
*  here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=182.26s)]
*  He's right. Republicans don't want an open process because that would risk exposing just [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=183.26s)]
*  how titanically weak their case actually is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=188.7s)]
*  Mr. Biden said that his father had no involvement in his business dealings, period. How do you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=191.78s)]
*  respond? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  That's not what Devin Archer said. There was telephone, phone calls, meetings, dinners, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  you name it. We know what happened with Bereaseman Ukraine in that December 4th through December [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=203.38s)]
*  9th time frame. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=207.1s)]
*  First of all, Devin Archer actually did say that they had no, nothing to do with the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=208.1s)]
*  business. So he's, he's got that wrong. But, but get this, think about that clip we just [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=212.42s)]
*  They are still in the year of our Lord, 2023, trying to make Bereasema a thing. Bereasema, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=217.54s)]
*  now in case you've forgotten what you're forgiven for doing. Bereasema is the widely debunked [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  conspiracy theory that Donald Trump sent Rudy Giuliani to dig up in Ukraine. That's the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=229.14s)]
*  one that Trump tried to threaten Zelensky into pushing publicly, even though it was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=235.54s)]
*  nonsense. The actual high crime that Trump was impeached for the first time back in 2020, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=242.58s)]
*  that's the source of it. So here we are, four years later, including nearly an entire year [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=249.22000000000003s)]
*  with the Republican House majority supposedly investigating these claims. And that's what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=253.9s)]
*  they got. They got the thrown away wrapper of a scandal from 2020. They've got nothing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=257.82s)]
*  Don't take my word for it though. Ask Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=265.7s)]
*  I have no evidence of it and I'm going to just follow the facts where they are. And [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=274.7s)]
*  the facts haven't taken me to that point where I can say that the president's guilty of anything. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=279.18s)]
*  That's Chuck Grassley. That is not some never Trump rhino. Chuck Grassley has been going [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=286.18s)]
*  after this stuff for years too. If you still need convincing the case against Biden's is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=290.18s)]
*  so thin as to be non-existent. Even the weatherman on the Fox and Friends couch isn't buying [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  it. Congressman, exit question for you. Have you found evidence that anybody broke any laws? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  You don't actually have any facts to that point. There's no evidence that Joe Biden [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  did anything illegally. I heard you yesterday refer to them as a crime family and this was [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  organized crime. So make it easy for us. What was the crime? Well, the crime is trading [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=319.84s)]
*  policy for money. Which policy? Well, we're going to get into that. Just you wait. Congressman [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, the guy leading the charge against [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=337.08s)]
*  Biden, that's their captain, my captain. He has done such a poor job outlining his case [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=340.64s)]
*  that he is getting torched by Steve Doocy of all people. In fact, get this, Comer won't [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=346.34s)]
*  even go on Fox and Friends anymore. He is hiding in his new safe space on an even more [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  MAGA network. Why would Doocy say of all the work you've done that you have nothing? Why [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=356.9s)]
*  do you think that is? Well, he's been this, he's had that position from the very beginning. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=363.9s)]
*  I quit going on Fox and Friends because of Doocy. Why would that mean Doocy, father of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  Doocy, do you like that? If your case is so thin that it won't even stand up to the soft [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=375.42s)]
*  focus scrutiny of Fox and Friends, I think it might be time to admit that you just don't [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  have the goods. But of course, James Comer and Jim Jordan and the rest of the MAGA caucus, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=386.14000000000004s)]
*  I think those folks know they don't have the goods at this point. They understand as well [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=389.98s)]
*  as anyone how flimsy this case is, but they're going to do it anyway for one reason and one [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=396.1s)]
*  reason only. Donald Trump wants them to do it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=401.14s)]
*  I rise to oppose this perverse illegitimate effort to do Donald Trump's political dirty [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  work. We're here today not because of any wrongdoing by President Biden, but because [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=410.18s)]
*  Donald Trump wants revenge. Welcome to the Donald Trump revenge show. This has never [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=414.26s)]
*  been about the truth. This is about avenging Donald Trump. The problem is they have zero [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=420.14000000000004s)]
*  evidence. The only crime is that Joe Biden blew out Donald Trump in the 2020 election. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  There is a through line to all of this. Donald Trump will violate the law and constitution [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=433.84s)]
*  to gain power and to keep it. And Republicans will enable him every step of the way. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=438.7s)]
*  You might be saying that was just a bunch of Democrats. If you don't believe them, well, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=446.76s)]
*  what about MAGA Republican Congressman Troinells of Texas? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=450.14s)]
*  Representatives, what are you hoping to gain from an impeachment inquiry? All I can say [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=454.44s)]
*  is Donald J. Trump 2024. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=459.44s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. There you have it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=462.56s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump is facing the most legal peril of any major presidential candidate [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=464.48s)]
*  in the nation's history. He's very likely to be on trial at least once in the new year, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=468.96s)]
*  perhaps more times. So his sycophants in Congress are desperate to counter program with a trial [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=474.16s)]
*  of their own. That is all today's vote was about. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8wJFrWgog&t=480.24s)]
