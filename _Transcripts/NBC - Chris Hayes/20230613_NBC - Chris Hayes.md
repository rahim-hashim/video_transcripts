# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights June 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8)
*  Donald Trump did not spend his post-indictment weekend strategizing with his lawyers, as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=0.0s)]
*  one might expect. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=5.4s)]
*  The ex-president hit the campaign trail, glad handing with supporters at events in Georgia [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=7.12s)]
*  and North Carolina. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=10.88s)]
*  And who is that over the president's shoulder while he signed memorabilia for his MAGA fans? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=12.56s)]
*  Why, it's Walt Noddell, the former White House valet turned Trump staffer, who just so happens [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=16.56s)]
*  to be Trump's co-defendant in the documents case. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=21.96s)]
*  The men will get to spend even more time together tomorrow when they are both expected to be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=25.6s)]
*  arraigned in a Florida courthouse. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=29.8s)]
*  That's when Noddell will take the first step in a long journey that many others have taken [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=31.84s)]
*  before him on the path to becoming the latest fall guy for the boss. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=35.28s)]
*  Michael Cohen knows something about that journey, having gone to prison for taking part in that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=39.56s)]
*  illegal hush money scheme Trump was indicted for earlier this year. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=43.32s)]
*  Cohen is the host of the Mea culpa podcast and co-host of the political beatdown podcast. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  The author of Revenge, how Donald Trump weaponized the US Department of Justice against his own [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=51.44s)]
*  critics, and he joins me now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=55.2s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=56.6s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=57.6s)]
*  So I want to set something up here because I thought about testimony that you gave before [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=58.64s)]
*  Congress about how Trump communicates, where you talked about his his mode of doing this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  And then I want to read from the indictment about the lawyer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=68.6s)]
*  We think it's Evan Quirk, an attorney, one who made notes about how Trump talked to him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=71.44s)]
*  So this is you talking to Congress in 2019. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=75.18s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=78.2s)]
*  Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=79.2s)]
*  That's not how he operates. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=84.36s)]
*  He doesn't give you questions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=86.5s)]
*  He doesn't give you orders. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=88.26s)]
*  He speaks in a code. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=90.04s)]
*  And I understand the code because I've been around him for a decade. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  Here's an example of the code. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=96.34s)]
*  This is Trump and Trump attorney one discuss what to do with the folder containing documents [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  with classification markings. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=101.7s)]
*  During that conversation, Trump made a plucking motion as memorialized by Trump attorney one, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=103.7s)]
*  believe it's Evan Quirk. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=107.66000000000001s)]
*  And he made a funny motion as well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=108.66000000000001s)]
*  OK, why don't you take them with you to your hotel room if there's anything really bad [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=110.34s)]
*  in there like, you know, pluck it out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=113.4s)]
*  That was a motion he made. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=115.74000000000001s)]
*  He didn't say that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=116.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=117.82s)]
*  Look, how many times more do I have to say that Donald speaks in code? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=118.82s)]
*  This one is a little bit less of a code. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=125.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=126.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=127.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  That I had explained it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=129.45999999999998s)]
*  But this wouldn't be unusual. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=130.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I've seen him do this when we were at the Trump Organization, when he questioned [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=131.45999999999998s)]
*  several of us attorneys in regard to turning over documents to the attorney general in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=136.62s)]
*  the Trump University case, when he said, why would you turn it over? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=142.06s)]
*  Just delete them, throw them away, get rid of them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=145.78s)]
*  So we're like, well, we're under subpoena. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=148.26s)]
*  And he was furious that one of the attorneys elected not to do it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=151.06s)]
*  And he was looking for somebody to validate the fact that he wanted it, that it could [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=155.64s)]
*  and should be done. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=161.7s)]
*  You see, Donald has no respect for the law. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=162.7s)]
*  He has no respect for the Constitution. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=165.94s)]
*  He has no respect for process. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=168.42s)]
*  He only cares about what he wants. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=170.28s)]
*  And as long as that is in concert with what he wants, it's acceptable. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=172.64s)]
*  Once it becomes adversary to what his wishes and wants are, he goes ballistic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=178.04s)]
*  I just want to go back to that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  So he's telling you, I mean, I guess it's a privileged conversation, but you know, like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  I said, that ship has sailed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  But he's telling you and the lawyers, like, why would you respond to, why would you truthfully [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=191.04s)]
*  respond to discovery, basically? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  Which is what he apparently says here as recorded in this indictment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=197.7s)]
*  And that's why I said to you that none of this is unusual. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=202.16s)]
*  It's a repeat of something, as I said, I had seen and been involved with going back many, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=207.0s)]
*  many years now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=213.6s)]
*  There's also just his conception of a lawyer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=214.6s)]
*  He talks about the Hillary Clinton lawyer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=219.16s)]
*  He seems to think that lawyers have like a magical power, like it's like in a comic book [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=221.08s)]
*  or something. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=226.04s)]
*  Like attorney-claiming privilege or something like makes them able to do stuff that like [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=227.04s)]
*  other people can't do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  And he wants them to do the bad stuff for him because they can do it and then save him [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=234.32s)]
*  getting in trouble. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=239.68s)]
*  I'm not so sure he sees it that way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=240.68s)]
*  I see it more that he doesn't care who he throws under the bus. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=243.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't care about the powers, it's not him. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  As long as it's not him that's going to reap the repercussions, he doesn't particularly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=250.32s)]
*  care. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=256.12s)]
*  But he wants other people to do the stuff. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=257.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=258.76s)]
*  And if it's coming from a lawyer, therefore it's okay. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=259.76s)]
*  It's better for him because he always has the out that the lawyer should have known. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=263.28s)]
*  That's why I have him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=269.32s)]
*  He's my lawyer. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=270.84s)]
*  He should have told me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=271.84s)]
*  It's plausible deniability. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's what you get in this crazy scene where he goes behind the back of his own lawyer [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  who's coming to search his stuff, moves all these boxes over the place. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  The lawyer comes and does the search, finds 38 documents anyway, and then calls up another, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=283.48s)]
*  a third lawyer, to ask her if she would come to Mar-a-Lago the next morning to act as the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=288.56s)]
*  custodian records and sign a certification regarding the search for documents with classification [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=292.76s)]
*  markings. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=297.36s)]
*  Christina Bob, we think that's attorney three, had no role in the review of Trump's boxes [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=298.36s)]
*  in the storage room. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  So basically, Corcoran gets wise to it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  And then he's like, I can't sign this thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=306.76s)]
*  And he gets Christina Bob to come and do it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=308.68s)]
*  And yet still 60% of the Republican Party says that they would vote for Donald even [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=311.16s)]
*  after an indictment. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=316.36s)]
*  Twice impeached, civilly held liable for sexual assault, indictment by state, indictment now [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=317.92s)]
*  by federal government, soon to be another state, Georgia, who knows what will happen [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=325.48s)]
*  with January 6th. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=331.8s)]
*  And yet they'll still do it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=333.36s)]
*  They'll still vote for a guy who legitimately does not want to be your president. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=335.04s)]
*  He wants to be your dictator. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=339.56s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=341.08s)]
*  But didn't you spend years looking up to this guy and thinking highly of him? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=342.08s)]
*  Remember, didn't you go through the exact same thing? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=345.44s)]
*  I sure did. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=347.32s)]
*  And I warned people of exactly including Mark Meadows at my House Oversight Committee hearing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=348.32s)]
*  when I said, I know what you're doing and it didn't work out right for me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=353.52s)]
*  And I assure you, it won't work out right for you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=357.29999999999995s)]
*  The difference though, is when I was representing him and taking care of him as his fixer, they [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=359.64s)]
*  He was just a myopic, real estate, New York, Florida developer. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=365.92s)]
*  He wasn't the president of the United States of America. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  So who really cared other than the handful of people that he was screwing over on contracts [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=374.44s)]
*  and so on, banks, et cetera? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=380.44s)]
*  What business was that of anybody else's? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=382.48s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=384.6s)]
*  Now as president of the United States, every single thing that he said becomes relevant [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=385.64s)]
*  to the world. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=390.82s)]
*  And the crazy thing is even though he's not president right now, he's still commanding [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=392.4s)]
*  more airtime than the current president, than the Biden administration. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=397.0s)]
*  Well, you know, if Joe Biden got himself indicted tomorrow, could we cover it quite a bit? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=400.88s)]
*  Well, you're probably right about that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=405.64s)]
*  And the bad part is what Trump is so clever at and he's so good at is this media manipulation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  All of a sudden, who cares about him stepping up and walking up onto the tarmac for his [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  plane or getting off? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  Why are we giving him so much oxygen to breathe? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  I just say you let it go. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=426.0s)]
*  First of all, I don't think tomorrow is going to be as big a deal as everyone's making in [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=427.68s)]
*  Florida. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  It certainly wasn't a big deal here in New York at all. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  There was more press than there were people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=434.48s)]
*  And I don't think that the oath keepers or the other crazy groups are going to be out [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  there doing anything, protesting. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=442.12s)]
*  Most of them are in prison right now anyway. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  And what happened to the help that Donald promised them? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=446.56s)]
*  Everyone that had done things to benefit Donald has gotten left in the dust. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=449.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=455.68s)]
*  And they will. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=456.68s)]
*  Well, that brings us to the final thing I want to ask you about is Walt Nodda, who is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=457.68s)]
*  indicted along with him and who is alleged to have participated in a conspiracy by being [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=462.72s)]
*  the person who moved the boxes at Donald Trump's direction and lied about it to federal agents. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=466.72s)]
*  And that lie is recorded in the indictment. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=471.0s)]
*  I find myself having some sympathy for the man, but I'm curious as someone who also has [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  been in a somewhat similar position, how you feel about it reading the facts about [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=478.16s)]
*  Mr. Nodda. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=482.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=483.56s)]
*  So Walt will get thrown under the bus. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=484.56s)]
*  There is no doubt about this one. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=487.56s)]
*  And if there's anything that I can do, I would look straight into the camera and say, Walt, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  I know you're watching. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=493.32000000000005s)]
*  Run. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=494.92s)]
*  Run as fast as you can, my friend. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=495.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  And as a former military guy, I know you know how to run quickly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  Run as quickly as you can because Donald Trump will throw you under the bus faster than you [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  could possibly imagine. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=506.32s)]
*  And he won't throw you under the bus simply just to save himself. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=508.12s)]
*  He'll just throw you under the bus simply because he can and because he thinks it will [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=511.52s)]
*  provide him with some form of a benefit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=516.28s)]
*  I think that's, I mean, I don't have a dog in the fight as it goes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=518.42s)]
*  I don't know Mr. Nodda at all, but that seems like sound advice to me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=521.52s)]
*  Michael Cohen, who does know a thing or two about how these dynamics work. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=524.36s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=527.6s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=528.6s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=529.6s)]
*  When Donald Trump appointed Bill Barr as attorney general of the United States in 2019, he wanted [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=531.6s)]
*  someone who would protect him. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=537.6s)]
*  And Bill Barr did not disappoint. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=539.32s)]
*  Soft peddling the Mueller report to launching an investigation into the FBI, Barr did a [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  whole lot for Trump. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=546.08s)]
*  As David Rove, the New Yorker, like no attorney general since the Watergate era, he has acted [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  as the president's political sword and shield. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=552.88s)]
*  So it was notable that Bill Barr went on TV this weekend and said this about the president's [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=556.32s)]
*  latest indictment. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=560.44s)]
*  If even half of it is true, then he's toast. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=563.08s)]
*  I mean, it's a pretty, it's a very detailed indictment and it's very, very damning. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=565.7600000000001s)]
*  And this idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch hunt is ridiculous. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes, he's been a victim in the past. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=578.2s)]
*  Yes, his adversaries have obsessively pursued him with phony claims. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=580.48s)]
*  And I've been at his side defending against them when he is a victim. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=585.96s)]
*  But this is much different. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=591.1600000000001s)]
*  He's not a victim here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=592.2800000000001s)]
*  If he had just turned over the documents, which I think every other person in the country [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=593.6s)]
*  would have done, the government's documents, their official records, they're not his personal [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=596.88s)]
*  records. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=601.76s)]
*  Battle plans for an attack on another country or defense department documents about our [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=602.76s)]
*  capabilities are in no universe Donald J. Trump's personal documents. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=608.64s)]
*  They are the government's documents. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=614.64s)]
*  I'm joined now by Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, served on the January [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=616.88s)]
*  6th committee, was the lead impeachment manager in the second impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=620.52s)]
*  Congressman, it's good to have you on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=625.08s)]
*  I haven't gotten a chance to talk to you since all this happened. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=626.76s)]
*  And I know that you're a constitutional law professor and know your way around the law [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=629.16s)]
*  and have thought a lot about Donald Trump's behavior, particularly in the run up to January [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=633.12s)]
*  6th and after. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=637.72s)]
*  And I'm curious what you make of the indictment. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=638.72s)]
*  Well, it's a powerful and devastating document, which, if it turns out to be true, leads irresistibly [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  to conviction and manifestation of his guilt. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=652.32s)]
*  I mean, it's a remarkable thing that he did. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=658.0s)]
*  And it's a very finely tuned instrument, this indictment, because it points out that [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=661.4s)]
*  there are hundreds and hundreds of documents that were taken. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=668.16s)]
*  But when he returned the first batch, they let him go on all of that stuff, even though [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=673.12s)]
*  it was a crime for him to be in unlawful possession of them originally. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=678.36s)]
*  They're only going after him for his continuing refusal to turn over other documents and then [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=682.92s)]
*  his game of hide and go seek that he plays with the government and indeed with his own [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=689.84s)]
*  lawyers. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=694.6s)]
*  So I think that they have found him on very clean and simple charges that seem irrefutable, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=696.2s)]
*  at least now. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=706.28s)]
*  But I'm curious, you know, under the presumption of innocence and due process, what he and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=707.28s)]
*  his lawyers will have to say about it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  We are in fairly uncharted constitutional territory here for this reason. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=714.16s)]
*  One is that there was reporting by multiple folks sourced to people around Trump that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=717.96s)]
*  one of the reasons he declared so early and he declared for election very early was so [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=723.44s)]
*  that he could point to any subsequent indictments as political, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=728.6800000000001s)]
*  He unilaterally could transform them into political and say, well, you're you're indicting [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  someone running for office if he decided to run for office early. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=737.2s)]
*  But it is the case now that presidential candidate is indicted in two different jurisdictions. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=741.2s)]
*  There may be further to go. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=747.5600000000001s)]
*  And this question about like timing and what justice looks like and what it would mean [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=750.76s)]
*  for the office, the presidency. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=754.4s)]
*  Like have you tried to get your head around any of that? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=756.36s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=760.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, Trump has got to accept the fact that constitutional agnosticism about your [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  criminal status cuts in both directions. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=769.0s)]
*  So he's very fond of saying even if he's convicted, he will run for office, even if he's in the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=771.64s)]
*  middle of trial, he will run for office and he will be president if he wins and so on. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=776.92s)]
*  And he's absolutely right that the only requirements for running for president are age and being [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=782.12s)]
*  a born citizen as opposed to a naturalized citizen of the country. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=789.0s)]
*  But it's also true that it works in the other direction, too. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=792.76s)]
*  You know, you you can't just by declaring yourself a candidate and running for office, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=796.0s)]
*  make yourself immune to all criminal prosecution and thereby go out and rape and murder and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=801.36s)]
*  pillage and say, well, you can't touch me because I'm running for the Republican or [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=806.4s)]
*  Democratic or Libertarian Party nomination in America. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=810.64s)]
*  It doesn't work like that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=814.48s)]
*  So you know, I think he's got to accept that that reality works in both directions. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=815.84s)]
*  And just like he can't be stopped from running because he's been indicted by a grand jury [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=824.56s)]
*  of his peers from South Florida. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=832.08s)]
*  Similarly, he can't be freed from ever being criminally prosecuted again because either [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  he's a candidate or he's in office. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=840.64s)]
*  So it seems to me that the folks that want to defend who have sort of devoted themselves [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=843.0400000000001s)]
*  to Trump's defense as the kind of primary responsibility in the House of Representatives, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=847.76s)]
*  your colleagues on the Republican side, are going to have a lot to say about this. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=853.76s)]
*  And this was Marjorie Taylor Greene today. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=857.6s)]
*  She says, well, this is her announcing a rider to defund Jack Smith. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=860.4000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen to that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  Today, I'd like to announce that I'm writing an appropriations rider to defund Jack Smith's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=867.44s)]
*  special counsel, his office and the investigation. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, this strikes me as largely inert and performative. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=878.32s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=880.88s)]
*  But there are other folks, Jim Jordan, James Comer, who might start mucking around with [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=882.48s)]
*  the Department of Justice on this. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=889.12s)]
*  And what do you anticipate and how do you chart the strategy for Democrats in the House [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=890.48s)]
*  to deal with it? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=894.64s)]
*  Well, that's an authoritarian playbook to attack the prosecutors or attack the judges [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=897.44s)]
*  to make your guy absolutely immune and impervious to the rule of law. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=903.36s)]
*  They're not going to be able to get that through the House, I don't think, much less [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=910.24s)]
*  the Senate. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=914.96s)]
*  And it's too late in any event. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=915.6s)]
*  But, you know, I think that it's worth us pausing to look at that strategy. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=917.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, these are people who declared Trump innocent before ever having seen the unsealed [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=924.96s)]
*  indictment, much less waited to see how the trial unfolds. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=931.92s)]
*  I mean, they're declaring themselves not just defense counsel, but also judge and jury in [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=935.84s)]
*  the case. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=941.6s)]
*  And they're declaring him innocent. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=942.0s)]
*  It's as if Donald Trump must be innocent of charges for anything that he does. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=944.16s)]
*  And he is, you know, as we know, absolutely incorrigible recidivist when it comes to [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=951.68s)]
*  offenses against the rule of law. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=958.72s)]
*  On January 6, obviously, quite famously, there were criminal recommendations that were offered [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=961.84s)]
*  by your committee. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=966.16s)]
*  Those have no force of law. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=966.72s)]
*  They're essentially just a, you know, you guys saying, look, we investigate this. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  We think crimes are committed, and we think we're committed by the president. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=973.52s)]
*  I wonder if the outcome of this investigation makes you feel in either direction about [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=977.12s)]
*  whether we would see some further criminal ramifications for his role in the coup. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=982.4s)]
*  Well, I think that there are a lot of people in the country breathing a sigh of relief [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=991.8399999999999s)]
*  that Donald Trump cannot completely escape the criminal justice consequences of his own [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=997.68s)]
*  actions. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=1005.92s)]
*  And, you know, as he gets away with one thing, you know, whether it's emoluments clause [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=1006.7199999999999s)]
*  violations or the Ukraine shakedown, then it empowers him and inspires him to go on [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=1012.2399999999999s)]
*  further and incite violent insurrection and steal government documents. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=1017.92s)]
*  So we do need to have some criminal consequences. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8ifAc5IH8&t=1027.68s)]
