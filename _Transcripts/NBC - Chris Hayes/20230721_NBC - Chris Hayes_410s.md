Video Description: “When you’re in control, when you have everything, you don’t become nicer and more considerate of other people’s views. You actually become more radicalized. And that’s a phenomenon I’ve seen in other countries and we can see it in Tennessee – and not only there,” says Anne Applebaum about Tennessee’s one-party political rule.

# Tennessee an example of backsliding democracy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM)
*  We've been hearing a lot about Democratic backsliding and autocracy in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=0.0s)]
*  If you want to get a real idea of what that looks like, take a look at what's happening in Tennessee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=4.0s)]
*  You'll remember a few months ago, the Republican supermajority in the state legislature drew national attention for expelling two black Democrat lawmakers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=8.0s)]
*  That same Republican supermajority also started taking aim at the state's largest and largely Democratic city, Nashville, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=17.0s)]
*  by trying to cut its governing council in half against the will of the voters. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=23.0s)]
*  Now, Tennessee is a red state. In 2020, Donald Trump won it with 61% of the vote. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=28.0s)]
*  But thanks to gerrymandering, Tennessee Republicans in the Senate control 82% of the seats and 76% of the state House. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=34.0s)]
*  And that Republican supermajority is using its power to pass laws like one of the most stringent abortion bans in the country [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=43.0s)]
*  and statewide restrictions on drag performances, which a court later blocked as unconstitutional. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=50.0s)]
*  Now, it was not always like this, as an Applebaum writes in the Atlantic, quote, not so long ago, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=56.0s)]
*  Tennessee was not merely a more bipartisan state, but a model of bipartisanship, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=61.0s)]
*  which in the 80s and 90s was ruled by moderate Democrats and liberal Republicans. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=67.0s)]
*  But today, Tennessee is a model of one party rule and quote. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=71.0s)]
*  Joining me now is an Applebaum Pulitzer Prize winning historian and staff writer at the Atlantic. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=76.0s)]
*  And good evening to you. Thank you for being with us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=81.0s)]
*  I mean, you recently spent time in Tennessee reporting on this story. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=83.0s)]
*  Tell me about what you found, because you are only we know you for studying real autocracies in places where democracy has struggled around the world. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=86.0s)]
*  Why Tennessee and what did you learn? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=94.0s)]
*  So, first of all, it's a little tongue in cheek. So Tennessee is part of the United States. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=97.0s)]
*  The Constitution applies. The Bill of Rights applies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=102.0s)]
*  Nashville is a lovely town. There's no central European gloom. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, it's not Budapest on the Cumberland, but you do see in Tennessee. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=109.0s)]
*  What is the effect of one party rule? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=114.0s)]
*  And there are ways in which it is reminiscent of what happens in other countries, other societies when you have the same phenomenon. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=117.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a there's a there's a technical explanation for it or technical reason why it's why this is true. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=124.0s)]
*  And this is to do with some of the things you just referred to in your introduction. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=132.0s)]
*  When you have a heavily gerrymandered state and when you have, as Tennessee does, very strict laws about voting, it's actually got one of the lowest voting rates in the country, maybe the lowest, depending on how you count. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=135.0s)]
*  That means that lawmakers are dependent on a really tiny number of people to get elected. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=147.0s)]
*  And very often those are the most partisan, the most radical in the state. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=153.0s)]
*  And so you get people who's really only constituents, the only people they care about are are the radicals. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=157.0s)]
*  You know, that creates that kind of atmosphere. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=164.0s)]
*  But there's a kind of existential thing that happens as well, which is that when you're in charge of everything and the Republicans are in charge of everything in Tennessee, you know, the state legislature, the governors, the you know, they point all the court positions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=166.0s)]
*  There's a kind of frustration that sets in as people say, well, we run everything, but we still can't get everything to be the way we want it to be. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=178.0s)]
*  And then you get a kind of radicalization. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=186.0s)]
*  I mean, it's almost as if when you're in control, when you have everything, you don't become nicer and, you know, more considerate of other people's views. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=190.0s)]
*  You actually become more radicalized. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=199.0s)]
*  And that's a phenomenon I've seen in other countries. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=201.0s)]
*  And we saw it and can see it in Tennessee. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=203.0s)]
*  And of course, not only there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=206.0s)]
*  So now we're back full circle to talking about Eastern Europe and places, central Europe, places that you studied, because I always wonder about this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=207.0s)]
*  Once you're in charge of the whole thing, don't you get all laid back and are nicer about the whole thing because you actually have control and you can be benevolent dictators. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=213.0s)]
*  But your research indicates not necessarily so, or at least not necessarily so in Tennessee. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=220.0s)]
*  No, I mean, the experience of total control, especially right now when you have a part of, you know, the Republican Party, a part of the voters in Tennessee who are now very, very concerned about social justice. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=227.0s)]
*  They want to see real issues. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=243.0s)]
*  They they follow very closely national media. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=244.0s)]
*  A lot of people in Nashville kept saying to me, oh, all politics is national now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=246.0s)]
*  You know, people used to say all politics is local, but people are very influenced by what they see on television. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=250.0s)]
*  They want, you know, real results. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=256.0s)]
*  They want to achieve things. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=258.0s)]
*  They want to they see things on Fox News and they want it to happen in Tennessee. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=259.0s)]
*  And of course, people don't have that kind of power. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=262.0s)]
*  And this creates a kind of frustration. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=265.0s)]
*  And so people become more radical. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=267.0s)]
*  They say we need more power. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=269.0s)]
*  We need to silence our opponents. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=270.0s)]
*  As we saw, you mentioned that the legislators being being thrown out a few months ago. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=271.0s)]
*  That's that's now you know, that's a reflection of the frustration that the ruling party has that it's not able to do the extreme things that it's most partisan voters want it to do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=278.0s)]
*  I'm curious about this because when you say most politics are national now, this makes a lot of sense when you think about book bands and drag shows and things like that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=291.0s)]
*  I mean, anybody anybody who grew up in a city anywhere knows that there have always been drag shows and they can have an effect on your life or not, depending on what you choose. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=299.0s)]
*  Most people who are involved in these book bands have not read the books that they're banning. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=306.0s)]
*  So I'm always curious as to what's the motivation behind rank and file Republicans supporting their elected members who are going down the road of dealing with these social issues when in fact there are real issues in Tennessee that I would assume I want my state legislature to be dealing with. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah, and Tennessee, as you said again in your introduction, was a was a model of bipartisanship where a lot of things did get done. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=327.0s)]
*  Nashville is a really successful city. There's a lot of investment there, you know, international investment companies from all over the country go there to set up headquarters. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=334.0s)]
*  But what the voters are seeing, they're seeing these kind of headline culture war issues, and that's what they see on TV. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=343.0s)]
*  And that's what is motivating them to vote. And they want their legislators to do something about it. And so you get these extreme actions, you know, these whether, as I said, whether it's book banning or whether it's unconstitutional laws about drag queens that can get overturned by the federal courts. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=352.0s)]
*  The point of enacting those things is to kind of rev up the base, get people going, show that we're fighting the culture war, but not necessarily to they don't necessarily achieve much. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=360.0s)]
*  They don't they don't change the lives of people in the state. But that's that's the way politics is going at it. And so I think that's the way politics is going at it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=370.0s)]
*  And so I think that's the way politics is going at it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=378.0s)]
*  . [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfqyjwKZMRM&t=408.0s)]
