# ‘Donny, do a deal’: Why 'Trust in the Dear Leader' is not an economic policy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ)
*  Steve Liesman is the CNBC's Senior Economics Reporter. Ali Velshi is the host of Velshi on MSNBC, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and they join me now. It's great to have you both here. Let's just start, I guess, with some of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=4.72s)]
*  consumer confidence data we got today, which was just brutal across the board. You know, there's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=10.08s)]
*  some question about whether this soft data matters as much anymore, if it's being skewed in certain [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=17.12s)]
*  ways. What's your read on that? Didn't you say it sucked? Yeah. I don't have anything to add. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=21.68s)]
*  I mean, that's, it was really awful. And I can just maybe add the following. The thing that matters [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  a lot to the Federal Reserve, which will make a determination somewhere along the line, if it can [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=32.32s)]
*  actually come in and help this economy by cutting interest rates, were the inflation expectations. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=36.8s)]
*  The idea that people expect inflation, and forget the one-year ones which you cited, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=42.08s)]
*  it's the five-year ones. The concern about inflation is not just for a one-year period. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  It's five years out that it's now deeply embedded. You've got to go back to 1991 for a bigger number. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=53.2s)]
*  And this idea is going to say, you know what? The Fed can't act. You've essentially tied the Fed's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=59.92s)]
*  hands through all those things my colleague Sarah Eisen was talking about. Higher interest rates, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=65.12s)]
*  you have a weaker currency, and a stock market that's really, and the idea of the full faith [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=70.0s)]
*  and credit of the United States government is now suspecting. Yeah. And we should just note that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=74.72s)]
*  inflation expectations are really important to what the Fed does, because expectations themselves [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=78.16s)]
*  have this weight in how the Fed is operating. I'll go as deep as you want on monetary policy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=83.28s)]
*  Right. I just want to be invited back. No. Well, just because it's one of these weird things where, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=88.08s)]
*  again, many folks know this, but many not. Right. The expectations, which is the psychological [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  phenomenon, has an actual real-world effect now in terms of what the Fed can do. It is true, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=98.56s)]
*  however, that we have not seen in the hard data a real decline in either consumer spending, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=103.2s)]
*  but that may only be because we haven't seen hard data since all of this nonsense began to happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=109.12s)]
*  I mean, that's part of what's weird here now, Ali, is that it's a little bit like, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=115.44s)]
*  like the markets are reacting now because they're pricing forward. Right. The actual [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=118.72s)]
*  stuff hasn't really started to hit the economy. In fact, I thought this is a great piece in CNBC [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=123.04s)]
*  today, that an alert from Customs and Border Protection on Friday notified users of a glitch [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  in the system that's used to exempt freight from tariffs. For now, that means that tariffs are not [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=132.4s)]
*  even being collected by the U.S. government. U.S. shippers tell CNBC they've not been charged higher [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=136.72s)]
*  tariff rates in their containers, some of which came in as late as yesterday. So we don't actually [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=141.12s)]
*  have the real thing happening. Right. So two things are going to happen. One is you're either [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=144.72s)]
*  going to buy something very quickly because you think inflation is going to go up, or you're going [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=147.6s)]
*  to put off your buying. If it's a house that you're building or renovating, you can't put it off long [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=151.6s)]
*  enough with lumber tariffs and import tariffs. Steve and I both had hair back before he started [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=156.48s)]
*  covering recessions. And the thing about a recession is 100% usually it's an exogenous [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=162.24s)]
*  thing that causes it, not a president, like it's an oil spike or it's a pandemic. And you can always [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=167.2s)]
*  get out of it. It's hard and sometimes it takes a while, but you lower interest rates, you flood [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=172.16s)]
*  the market with money, and things happen. And the market then after a recession generally performs [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  very well, and you carry on and you've got what's called creative destruction. A recession, which we [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=180.88s)]
*  may be headed toward, we may be in. And inflation, as he said, now the Fed's hands are tied. You can't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=186.32s)]
*  cut rates to strengthen the economy, which is what Donald Trump wants to happen. You can't raise [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=193.44s)]
*  rates if you've got a slowing economy. You could get stuck in that. And people need to realize, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=198.72s)]
*  if you get stuck in that, like Japan did, that was a decade. You could wreck America's economy [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=203.2s)]
*  for a decade and you could take the world with you. We had a Fed official on today, the Minneapolis [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=209.28s)]
*  Fidelser president, and I'm very much paraphrasing what he said. It was, Donnie, do a deal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=213.92s)]
*  They really want this deal with China done so these terrorists can go away so they can get on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=220.64s)]
*  with the process of trying to do what they can do, which is to address the economy as it exists. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=225.04s)]
*  And I think, look, I think that a deal is not unlikely. I mean, I don't know what's going to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=230.64s)]
*  happen, but I think that one of the things we saw with his reaction to what the bond markets did [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  earlier in the week was he got freaked out. But we should all be a little freaked out by that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=240.0s)]
*  The idea that that money all came out of equities and didn't somehow end up in the U.S. dollar, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=245.52s)]
*  that didn't end up in bonds. What does that say? We have a thing we call it the flight to safety. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=250.56s)]
*  When the world gets very weird, people plow into the dollar, and that didn't happen. That really [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=256.56s)]
*  was thinking that there's this fundamental rethinking of the safety and soundness of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=261.92s)]
*  dollar assets. The core experience of this for most people is going to be the real economy and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=266.24s)]
*  whether there is a recession and prices go up. And I thought this was really interesting. I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=271.04s)]
*  thought the Washington Post did this. Kudos to them today. They did a really interesting and cool [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=274.72s)]
*  thing. They just went out and they polled manufacturing workers specifically. The whole [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=278.24s)]
*  idea is this is for you guys. We're doing it for manufacturing. So they went and they said, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=282.16s)]
*  what do you think of the terrorists? The Washington Post asked more than 500 workers in manufacturing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=287.12s)]
*  jobs across the country what they think. More than twice as many manufacturing workers say [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=291.36s)]
*  terrorists would hurt rather than help their job and career. 57% versus 22%. What do you think of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=295.6s)]
*  that result? Because if you are a manufacturing worker in this country, what you would appreciate [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=300.88s)]
*  is a robust manufacturing strategy. And once you have that strategy about what would we like to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=306.0s)]
*  build here, how much would we like to pay our workers for that, how much should we build versus [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=310.8s)]
*  how much do we import, tariffs then become a tool by which you refine and forward that strategy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=314.56s)]
*  We put the cart before the horse. We've got the tariffs on Lesotho, which creates— [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=320.08s)]
*  Diamonds. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=326.08s)]
*  Well, they got diamonds and a bunch of fabric textiles that we don't want to import. So we [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  shouldn't probably have a 50% tax on a tariff on Lesotho. There are some things you want to tariff. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=334.64s)]
*  Chinese electric vehicles are probably something you want to tariff because we want to build that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  industry here. But you have to have a manufacturing strategy first. We did decide we wanted [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=343.84s)]
*  semiconductors because we saw in the pandemic really bad to not have semiconductor manufacturing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=348.56s)]
*  So we're starting that. But it's a years-long process. It's not a this-year thing. It's going [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=354.24s)]
*  to happen over time. We need a policy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=357.76s)]
*  And also, one of the things that is so crazy to me about this idea of a recession, which the Wall [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=359.44s)]
*  Street Journal, we quoted them yesterday, advisors close to Trump being like, he's fine with a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=363.44s)]
*  recession. He doesn't want to cause a depression, is that a recession is not going to be good for [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=367.68s)]
*  American manufacturing. It really can't be overstated enough that the cyclical does stuff [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=372.32s)]
*  in the long term. We've seen this before. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=377.6s)]
*  But you know where it does it? In the manufacturing sector. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=379.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  I ran these numbers. I looked at how many jobs are lost, manufacturing jobs, in a typical recession. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  10%. OK, the rest of the economy, the rest of the private sector minus manufacturing loses 4%. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=388.48s)]
*  That's in the median recession. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=395.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  Overlay that over the 12.7 million workers in manufacturing. You would lose 1.2 million [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  manufacturing jobs in your effort to restore the manufacturing of this country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=404.16s)]
*  Here's the one question, to the point of what the Minneapolis Fed governor was saying. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=410.16s)]
*  Can he basically just back down completely? Is there a way to just go back? Or has the level of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=415.44s)]
*  uncertainty and craziness done something that he can't get out of? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm interested in all these answers here, which is, first of all, this is my seventh crisis as a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  reporter. I go back to the SNL crisis of 89. There's never one created by one person. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=433.36s)]
*  My concern at this point is you create a momentum, a loop, a bad loop, a negative loop, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=440.72s)]
*  that he cannot then undo. And if he did undo it, the question becomes, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=446.8s)]
*  is the degradation of the faith and credit of the United States now suspect? You don't do [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  economic policy this way. What fascinated me was this notion of trust in the dear leader. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  That's not an economic policy. The key to me is you do this process. She didn't say [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=466.23999999999995s)]
*  trust in the tariffs, trust in the work that was done. There is no piece of paper from them [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=475.2s)]
*  that says these tariffs will mean X growth. In the old days, when the world was a little [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=481.2s)]
*  more sane, they'd call us economic reporters in. They'd give us a briefing book this big. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=488.08s)]
*  They had numbers. They may not be the right numbers. But this is our strategy. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=494.4s)]
*  But they were numbers. We modeled this out. We don't think we were going to have X number of jobs. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  And then we made fun of them if they didn't hit the jobs. But there was something to aim at. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  There's nothing here. There's the trust in jobs. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=506.64s)]
*  I was saying we're absent in manufacturing policy. We're just absent in any policy on this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=509.36s)]
*  I would like somebody to tell me, what does success look like at the end of this thing? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=513.6s)]
*  Looks like intimidation. It looks like a power play. But in the end, what does success look like? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=517.84s)]
*  I know what it is. If the penguins call and surrender. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=522.72s)]
*  That's right. Penguins for all. And we finally start [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=525.92s)]
*  growing our own coffee and bananas here in the US. And vanilla from Madagascar. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=528.8s)]
*  And Hallie Melchee. Thank you, Mo. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0suAU3k2zQ&t=532.08s)]
