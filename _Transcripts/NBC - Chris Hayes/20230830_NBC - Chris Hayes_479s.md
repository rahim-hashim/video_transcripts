# Hayes: Giuliani defamation ruling is ‘down payment on actual accountability’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=0.0s)]
*  We finally got some semblance of accountability for one of the darkest chapters of Donald Trump's attempted coup a district judge has found today [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=2.12s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani liable for defaming to Georgia election workers as part of his effort to spread Donald Trump's big lie of a stolen [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=10.98s)]
*  2020 election [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=19.2s)]
*  Disgraced former mayor will now go on civil trial to determine how much he pay must pay in damages to Ruby Freeman and her [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=20.56s)]
*  daughter Shay Moss over statements like this which Giuliani has already admitted in court proceedings were false and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=28.44s)]
*  defamatory [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=36.52s)]
*  We're gonna taking those ballots out. Look at them scurrying around with the ballots. Nobody in the room hiding around [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=37.88s)]
*  They look like this. They look like they're passing out dope not just about [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=43.36s)]
*  It is quite clear. They're stealing votes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  It's a tape earlier in the day of Ruby Freeman and Shay Freeman Mars and one of the gentlemen [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Quite obviously surreptitiously passing around [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or cocaine [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=60.72s)]
*  That was a transparently racist lie [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=64.56s)]
*  Obvious and despicable at the time [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=68.6s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and Shay Moss did absolutely nothing wrong [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=71.0s)]
*  In fact, they were just two women who wanted to contribute their efforts and labor maintenance of American democracy and to dispatch their duty with [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=73.8s)]
*  diligence and patriotism [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=81.44s)]
*  They initially became the target of these conspiracies when a far-right website published blatant lies about the two women [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=83.36s)]
*  Committing widespread voter fraud in Georgia that initiated a kind of feedback loop that then made its way to both Giuliani and Donald Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=90.4s)]
*  Who decided to make these two black women the center of their deranged voter fraud conspiracy? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=98.28s)]
*  Again, and again both in public and in private the two men lied claiming these two election workers again two women who are [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=104.92s)]
*  doing the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Glamourless work of making sure an election works right counting votes that these two women had somehow stolen [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=114.28s)]
*  tens of thousands of votes in the state of Georgia on [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=120.56s)]
*  That infamous call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger the ex-president who's now been indicted for it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=123.8s)]
*  Mentioned Ruby Freeman by name [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=131.72s)]
*  nearly 20 times [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=134.84s)]
*  the 18,000 voters [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=137.04s)]
*  Having to do with the Ruby Freeman that's she's a vote scammer a professional vote scammer and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  hustler Ruby Freeman the minimum number is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=146.6s)]
*  18,000 for Ruby, but they think it's probably about 56,000 [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  But the minimum number is 18,000 or the Ruby Freeman night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuff [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=154.48s)]
*  She stuffed the ballot boxes. Let's face it Brad. Can I just say something about that that that section which just to take a second here [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=161.38s)]
*  The votes at that point had been counted three times. I think they've been counted and recounted and hand recounted [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=168.48s)]
*  So think about how? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=174.56s)]
*  Blatantly ludicrous. I mean past what even Donald Trump could believe that one woman had just like [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  Stolen 56,000 votes on a USB and no one had just figured it out [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=183.2s)]
*  Like it's not a delusion [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  Hey, that's past delusion, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  After they became the target of this harassment campaign from the most powerful man on earth Ruby Freeman and shame moss had their lives destroyed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Destroyed as moss told the January 6th committee last summer [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=203.12s)]
*  My life upside down [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=208.68s)]
*  I no longer give out my business card. I don't transfer calls [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=215.68s)]
*  I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=220.52s)]
*  Don't want anyone knowing my name I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=223.72s)]
*  Don't want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=226.28s)]
*  I don't go to the grocery store at all [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=231.52s)]
*  Haven't been anywhere [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=234.84s)]
*  At all [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=238.08s)]
*  Additionally a Ruby Freeman was forced to call 9-1-1 [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=240.08s)]
*  multiple times in the weeks after election [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Over messages containing racial slurs and even death threats telling one dispatcher quote [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  They're saying stuff like we're coming to get you. We are coming to get you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=249.36s)]
*  on at least two occasions strangers showed up at Freeman's door in the middle of the night and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=254.0s)]
*  Then well then came Kanye's former publicist [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=260.88s)]
*  On January 4th 2021 a woman named Trevion Kuti showed up at Ruby Freeman's door offering to help her and a terrified [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=264.6s)]
*  Freeman who had been facing threats for a month now agreed to meet with Kuti at a local police station [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=272.44s)]
*  And that's when Trevion Kuti working in conjunction with a man named Harrison Floyd [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=277.52s)]
*  Apparently tried to threaten Freeman into falsely admitting that she did in fact rig the election for Biden [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=281.88s)]
*  I cannot say [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=294.36s)]
*  I [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=302.44s)]
*  You are a loose end for a party music type what on earth what a nightmare what a nightmare [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=314.92s)]
*  That woman Trevion Kuti along with Harrison Floyd have also both been indicted in the Georgia Rico case [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=322.04s)]
*  You can see them there in their mugshots and of course [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=327.64s)]
*  So to his Rudy Giuliani we last saw it last week when he was spotted at a second-chance bail bonds in Atlanta [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=331.12s)]
*  But the coup lawyers legal headaches don't end there according to a new report in Rolling Stone special counsel [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=338.64s)]
*  Jack Smith is reportedly probing Rudy Giuliani's apparent [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=343.8s)]
*  drinking problem [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=347.88s)]
*  specifically Smith's investigators want to know quote whether Donald Trump was knowingly relying on an inebriated attorney while trying to overturn a presidential election [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=349.52s)]
*  Giuliani is also facing a lawsuit from a former employee who is accusing him of some truly vile behavior [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=358.2s)]
*  Which I'm not gonna repeat here including graphic allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  tirades containing homophobic slurs and anti-semitic comments [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=369.24s)]
*  Allegations we should note that Giuliani denies [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=373.44s)]
*  Of course, we do not know how many of those cases will play out [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=376.44s)]
*  But at the very least Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss have some [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  accountability today [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=384.76s)]
*  What Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump the rest of what they did to these women was one of the most disgusting aspects of this entire episode [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=386.68s)]
*  And now he's gonna have to pay for it [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=393.56s)]
*  Trump and his confederates act like no one will ever hold them accountable. That's how they acted through much of the administration [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  It's how they acted after the 2020 election where they try to destroy these women's lives as part of a headlong run at ending American [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=403.56s)]
*  Democracy it is how they are acting now in many respects and the only thing that will change their behavior is to do the thing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=410.0s)]
*  They don't think will happen [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=416.46s)]
*  Hold them accountable and not just once they have to be shown over and over and over and over again [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=418.82s)]
*  They cannot just get away with everything the way they have most of their lives [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  And while Giuliani losing a civil defamation case is not the same thing as facing years in prison in Georgia [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=432.38s)]
*  Or a potential federal indictment down the line [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=437.58s)]
*  It is a kind of down payment on [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=440.02s)]
*  actual accountability [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=442.9s)]
*  So there is some measure of justice today [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and shame off said in a statement today the fight to rebuild our reputations and to repair the damage to our lives is not [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=448.38s)]
*  Over but today we're one step closer and for that we are grateful [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=454.5s)]
*  You [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfN5m_lTz4&t=474.9s)]
