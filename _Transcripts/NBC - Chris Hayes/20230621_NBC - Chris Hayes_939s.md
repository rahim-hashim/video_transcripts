# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 20
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo)
*  When Joe Biden was sworn in as president of the United States in 2021, he did what is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=0.0s)]
*  customary for any incoming president to do. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=4.36s)]
*  He replaced all the U.S. attorneys in the country and appointed new ones. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  All that is except two. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=11.52s)]
*  He kept John Durham, remember that guy? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=14.08s)]
*  Durham was allowed to stay on and complete what was essentially a Trump-ordered wild [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=16.36s)]
*  goose chase to bring the deep state to account, a goose chase which came up with basically [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=20.56s)]
*  nothing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=25.72s)]
*  And then there was David Weiss. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=26.92s)]
*  David Weiss is a Delaware U.S. attorney and he is the man who launched the probe into [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Hunter Biden in 2018. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=32.6s)]
*  The new president, Joe Biden, left Weiss there in Delaware so as not to interfere in any [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=35.76s)]
*  way in the ongoing investigation of his own son. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=41.3s)]
*  Well, today, five years after that investigation was first opened up, the president's son, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=45.2s)]
*  Hunter Biden, reached a plea deal with the Department of Justice. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=50.4s)]
*  Biden will plead guilty to two federal misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his taxes and he [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=53.72s)]
*  will avoid a felony gun possession charge related to his purchase of a firearm while [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=59.2s)]
*  he was using drugs in 2018. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=64.76s)]
*  We should note this is very, very, very rarely prosecuted on those terms. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=66.72s)]
*  Now, a federal judge still needs to approve the agreement which would result in Hunter [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=71.32s)]
*  Biden serving probation, but most likely no jail time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=76.44s)]
*  He's expected to appear in court in the coming days to be arraigned and enter his guilty [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  prison play. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=83.2s)]
*  It's been a remarkable road to get to this point. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=84.2s)]
*  I mean, the first time the Department of Justice has brought charges against the child of a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=87.04s)]
*  sitting president. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=90.72s)]
*  And it appears from what we know and from the timeline that federal prosecutors dealt [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=91.72s)]
*  with this case very similarly to their investigation into ex-President Trump, which is to say at [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=96.84s)]
*  every point up and down the chain of command, they went out of their way, bending over [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=102.78s)]
*  backwards so as not to appear partisan or biased or unfair. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=107.84s)]
*  As we just learned from the new reporting in the Washington Post, the FBI resisted investigating [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=112.92s)]
*  Donald Trump for his role on January 6th for more than a year. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=117.66s)]
*  Quote, awareness about appearing partisan, institutional caution and clashes over how [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=121.4s)]
*  much evidence was sufficient to investigate the actions of Trump and those around him [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=126.08s)]
*  all contributed to the slow pace. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=130.44s)]
*  And this probe of Hunter Biden has dragged on for five years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=133.36s)]
*  That's a long time, a sweeping investigation involving federal prosecutors, FBI agents, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=136.8s)]
*  IRS officials. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=141.88s)]
*  It has resulted in charges that experts say are rarely prosecuted. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=143.6s)]
*  That gun charge in particular, prohibiting a drug addict from owning a weapon, is rarely [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=147.28s)]
*  used statute that is facing legal challenges, has been used in high profile cases where [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=153.18s)]
*  the underlying conduct doesn't violate any obvious federal criminal statute. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=158.04s)]
*  Notably, Weiss did not bring any charges related to Hunter Biden's dealing with foreign entities, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=163.68s)]
*  involving years, years of accusations from Republicans about his ties to China and Ukraine. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=169.32s)]
*  And again, presumably they looked at that stuff in the five years they were going through [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=174.68s)]
*  it all. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=179.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=180.88s)]
*  But of course, Republicans began moving the goalposts almost immediately after this news [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=181.88s)]
*  broke. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=186.68s)]
*  Donald Trump, Joe Biden's most likely opponent next year, wrote, quote, the corrupt Biden [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=187.68s)]
*  DOJ just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere traffic [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=191.0s)]
*  ticket. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Our system is broken. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Congressman James Comer of Kentucky pledged to continue the oversight committee's investigation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=198.12s)]
*  into the president's son, saying, we will not rest until the full extent of President [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  Biden's involvement in the family's schemes are revealed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=206.4s)]
*  Now the right wing attacks on the Bidens, particularly on Hunter Biden, have generally [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=211.08s)]
*  been in bad faith. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  I will say there has been some legitimate criticism, particularly of Hunter Biden's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  work for Ukrainian energy company called Burisma, an appointment that certainly had the appearance [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=220.52s)]
*  and to my mind likely substance of a foreign entity clearly attempting to just purchase [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  access to the then vice president of the United States or to curry favor. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=231.55999999999997s)]
*  And Hunter Biden obviously should not have accepted that role. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  But he's made a lot of bad judgment calls over the year. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  It's not just that one. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=242.64s)]
*  And I think both Hunter Biden and his father would agree, largely related to his lifelong [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=244.27999999999997s)]
*  struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  And all the attacks on Hunter Biden are, of course, just a way to hurt his father, obviously, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=252.28s)]
*  as Peter Baker puts it in New York Times. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=258.04s)]
*  If you watch right wing media, and I don't know how much you do, they are obsessed with [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=274.56s)]
*  Hunter Biden. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=280.56s)]
*  They sort of engage in a kind of ritual humiliation of him, a mainstay of their programming. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=281.84s)]
*  And it is all, frankly and clearly, an attempt to wage a sort of psychological warfare upon [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=286.4s)]
*  the president. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=292.68s)]
*  Joe Biden has no control over the actions of his adult son. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=294.8s)]
*  We all know that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=299.76s)]
*  I think the people pressing these ridiculous attacks know that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=300.76s)]
*  His sole surviving son, we should note, who he obviously loves deeply, a love that was [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=304.08s)]
*  laid bare in a just profoundly moving leaked voicemail message Biden left for Hunter Biden, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=309.4s)]
*  his son, while he was in the throes of a bad spell of addiction in 2018. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  A voicemail the right wing presented as some kind of damaging evidence against them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm here no matter what you need. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=339.4s)]
*  No matter what you need, I love you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  I would bet good money that the majority of people that just heard that right now have [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  heard it, have had someone they loved who was in a similar spot as Hunter Biden, dealing [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  with substance issues, and can relate to that, maybe even admire the way that Joe Biden spoke [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=359.12s)]
*  to his son. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=367.76s)]
*  Hunter Biden thankfully did get help and credits his family for never giving up on him. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=369.4s)]
*  I think today's result of the long, long investigation into Hunter Biden is ultimately good for the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=375.12s)]
*  rule of law and for justice, even though I think honestly they probably went out of their [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=380.44s)]
*  way to charge him. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=383.8s)]
*  But no one, no one should lose sight of what this was all about, the sheer sadism of an [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=386.44s)]
*  attempt to wield a son's addiction against the father for political purposes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=391.18s)]
*  That's what has animated this entire enterprise from the beginning. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=397.6s)]
*  They're going to have the right to compel unwanted medical interventions on us. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=401.36s)]
*  The Nazis did that in the camps in World War II. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=411.72s)]
*  They tested vaccines on gypsies and Jews. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=416.0s)]
*  As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. back in August of 2020 comparing mask mandates to experiments [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=419.88s)]
*  the Nazis conducted on Jews and gypsies or Roma people during the Holocaust. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=425.12s)]
*  That gives you a sense for exactly who R.F.K. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=430.12s)]
*  Jr., well, where he's coming from ideologically. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=432.84s)]
*  Two months ago, he announced he would challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=437.44s)]
*  While his bid to challenge Biden for the nomination is most definitely a long shot, it relies [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  really heavily on the low trust, paranoid environment we increasingly find ourselves [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=446.28s)]
*  in. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=452.12s)]
*  I don't think his presidential bid as such is particularly noteworthy. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=453.44s)]
*  I don't think he has much of a shot. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=458.6s)]
*  One important thing I want to discuss, though, is that the vaccine scare monitoring that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=461.48s)]
*  he's made his career for the last 15 years or more, along with the same kind of line [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=465.56s)]
*  from people like Tucker Carlson, has had just really unfathomable human costs. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=471.4s)]
*  It has likely resulted in many thousands of people, tens of thousands of people getting, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  not getting vaccinated during the coronavirus and many, many deaths. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=481.46s)]
*  I mean, keep in mind the United States vaccination rate lags behind many of our pure countries. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=485.62s)]
*  The purple line all the way at the bottom is U.S. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=490.62s)]
*  Vax rate. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=492.58s)]
*  Our country is with the UK at the top of the coronavirus deaths by population compared [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=493.9s)]
*  to pure nations. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=497.41999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that contributes to that, not just our vaccination rate, but the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=498.41999999999996s)]
*  low vaccination rate is driving a significant portion of the excess mortality. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=501.85999999999996s)]
*  NBC News senior reporter Brandy Zdrasny recently spoke with R.K. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=507.9s)]
*  Jr. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=511.34s)]
*  In one telling exchange, he explained, quote, there are rules that make it difficult for [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=512.34s)]
*  the public airwaves to censor you, he said, miss citing a federal law that requires broadcast [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=515.66s)]
*  stations provide candidates for public office with equal opportunity airtime. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=520.74s)]
*  So I thought maybe I should run. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm joined now by Brandy Zdrasny. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=526.9s)]
*  So what's striking to me about this candidacy is that it's a locus of a whole suite of kind [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=529.24s)]
*  of, you know, skeptical to paranoid conspiracy theories and worldviews that were very familiar [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=535.82s)]
*  to me, sort of mostly left inflected from like the 1990s, but not exclusively, but fundamentally [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=544.34s)]
*  this suite of issues that increasingly has sort of moved to the right part of the spectrum [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=552.58s)]
*  that all sort of fit with each other in one worldview, which is like they are out to get [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=557.98s)]
*  you. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  They are lying to you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=563.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=564.78s)]
*  And I think that's right. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=565.78s)]
*  It's sort of the zombification of all of these old conspiracy theories about putting things [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=566.78s)]
*  in the water to get you there in some way harming you. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=571.3s)]
*  And, you know, they don't they're covering it up. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=574.2199999999999s)]
*  And Big Pharma has always played a big role in these conspiracy theories. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=576.42s)]
*  And for two decades, R.K. Jr. has been sort of the leader of these movements. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=580.26s)]
*  But we're afraid of these things, whether it's GMOs or, you know, things in the water, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=586.0999999999999s)]
*  cell phone towers or Wi-Fi. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=591.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=593.38s)]
*  Giving you cancer like he's always sort of been the leader of this movement. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=594.38s)]
*  But I don't think you can understate the impact that COVID has had on our minds. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=597.82s)]
*  And whatever happened during COVID, people weren't stuck in lockdowns. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=602.22s)]
*  People were on the Internet more often. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=606.4200000000001s)]
*  People were away from their communal activities like church and everything else. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=611.26s)]
*  And they had a once in a century disruption. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=612.26s)]
*  Oh, yes, that too. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=613.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=616.26s)]
*  And they were terrified. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=617.26s)]
*  It was upsetting and traumatizing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=618.26s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=619.26s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=620.26s)]
*  But whatever happened during that time, all of those things combined, people really dove [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=622.18s)]
*  down the rabbit hole at that time. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=624.38s)]
*  Even Joe Rogan will say, he said on his podcast the other day, he's like, I was like kind [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=626.3s)]
*  of a normal guy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=630.86s)]
*  And then COVID opened my eyes. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=631.86s)]
*  And you can't believe how many people have fallen down that same rabbit hole. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=633.18s)]
*  And RFK has really chosen to gobble up the spotlight in a time where he is the leader [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=636.22s)]
*  of everybody's brainworms. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=642.12s)]
*  Well, but this is what's so fascinating to me. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=643.12s)]
*  So what you have seen is a polarization between the party coalition sorting along low trust, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=645.38s)]
*  high trust. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=649.98s)]
*  So you have increasingly the center to center left is a higher social trust coalition. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=651.14s)]
*  The center to center right to the right wing is a low social trust coalition. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=658.5s)]
*  And so this migration where RFK comes from the left, I mean, he's, you know, obviously [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=663.22s)]
*  is the most famous name in democratic politics, but also like how he aligns his politics. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=668.58s)]
*  But the people that are most enthusiastic about him right now are Roger Stone and Elon [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=672.46s)]
*  Musk and Joe Rogan and Donald Trump has good things to say to him. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=675.78s)]
*  And he's getting all this amplification because that kind of stuff is the beating heart of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=679.06s)]
*  right wing politics right now. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=683.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=684.74s)]
*  But also because I think a lot of people are trying to use him as a spoiler candidate. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=685.74s)]
*  They want the disruptions. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=689.18s)]
*  Steve Bannon has been for months and months pumping him up, had him on his show during [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=690.18s)]
*  COVID, had just saying all the best things about him. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=694.46s)]
*  He's just wonderful. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=697.38s)]
*  He should be Trump's running mate, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=698.38s)]
*  Obviously Steve Bannon likes to cause a little trouble. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=701.34s)]
*  And so that seems clearly like what's going on there. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=703.46s)]
*  But yes, all of the things that RFK stands for now seem to be right wing feelings, right [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=705.54s)]
*  wing ideas. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=712.9s)]
*  And so there's like every, his entire Facebook group, you know, thousands of people like [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=713.9399999999999s)]
*  over and over and over again, it was, I would never ever vote for a Democrat, but I'm going [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=718.9s)]
*  to vote for RFK Jr. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=723.06s)]
*  You know, that is his fan base now. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=724.42s)]
*  And I don't think he particularly likes it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=726.5s)]
*  When I asked him about that on the trail, he kind of bristled. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=728.0999999999999s)]
*  I think it sort of annoys him just a little bit. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=731.52s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, he's got this policy of like, I'm going to unite the ends of the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=733.62s)]
*  horseshoe. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=738.02s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=739.02s)]
*  But it's an uncomfortable situation for a Democratic sign. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=740.58s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=745.42s)]
*  Not just any Democratic sign. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=746.66s)]
*  I mean, again, the most famous revered, beloved name in Democratic politics in America. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=747.66s)]
*  What was your, I mean, that quote that we've said from your piece, I mean, it does seem [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=755.5s)]
*  like fundamentally a kind of attentional play, right? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=759.7s)]
*  I can get attention for these things that I believe and care about, which I don't have [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=763.4599999999999s)]
*  any reason to think he doesn't believe what he states to believe, unfortunately. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=768.1s)]
*  And so this is sort of a perfect sort of hacking of the attentional programming to be able [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=773.38s)]
*  to insert this into the election. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=780.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think two things can be true at once. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=781.86s)]
*  I think that one, he is using this time to get back on Instagram and to, you know, be [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=783.86s)]
*  able to speak on TV and have people have the networks call him, which they didn't for a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=789.1s)]
*  long time because of his anti-vax ideas became unpalatable. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=792.9s)]
*  And so, yeah, he's sort of loving this time and he's using this time to be back in the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=797.34s)]
*  spotlight to reach a wider audience. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  Having said that, and I think he's a delusional man in almost every sense of the word and [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=802.78s)]
*  almost every way that he could be. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  But I think he thinks that he can win. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=809.8199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, like we just said, there's a mass delusion since COVID and he seems to [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=812.3s)]
*  have fallen for one as well. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=816.14s)]
*  Yeah, you know, one of the things to me that the vaccine stuff puts this very fine point [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=818.14s)]
*  on a bunch of different arguments, like there's this stuff today about how the GOP is targeting [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=821.9799999999999s)]
*  researchers who study disinformation ahead of 2024. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=825.4599999999999s)]
*  I have to say that I find myself sort of sympathetic to some of the like nuance and difficult [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=828.6999999999999s)]
*  conversation about speech and disinformation, misinformation, like people believe all sorts [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=833.7399999999999s)]
*  of wrong stuff and what someone thinks is wrong turns out to be right. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=837.8599999999999s)]
*  And like there's a lot of policing. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=841.18s)]
*  Those lines is like very complicated. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=842.9799999999999s)]
*  But when you focus on the vaccines, it's like you really see the combination of sort of [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=845.34s)]
*  low trust social environment, amplification, social media and specifically like a market [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=850.14s)]
*  and a demand for anti-vax stuff has produced like really tangible, huge amounts of human [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=855.46s)]
*  destruction. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=860.98s)]
*  You can see that's avoidable in this country. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=862.46s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=865.1s)]
*  We've killed hundreds of thousands of people for no reason who could have been saved by [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=866.5400000000001s)]
*  a vaccine, had no reason to die and they are dead from COVID. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  We have back diseases that were eradicated. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=874.26s)]
*  We have polio back in this country now. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=877.62s)]
*  We are measles are coming back just in 2019. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=879.5400000000001s)]
*  Eighty three people, mostly small children, died in Samoa of measles. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=882.94s)]
*  And even that didn't change the idea for RFK and lots of people. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=886.82s)]
*  They just moved the goalpost and said, oh, well, then it wasn't it was really the measles [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=891.74s)]
*  vaccine that killed all those people. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=895.1s)]
*  So, yeah, it's just a really sad time and vaccines are you can quibble over the types of [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=897.5400000000001s)]
*  moderation that we do. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=903.86s)]
*  Right. And there is quibbling to be done. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=905.14s)]
*  Right. But on vaccines, the science is clear. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=907.1s)]
*  It is clear. This is nonsense and it's dangerous. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=909.42s)]
*  Well, it's actually never been clearer than even COVID, which is sort of the like awful, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=912.02s)]
*  awful tragic irony. The whole thing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=916.02s)]
*  Brandice, thank you very much. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL46jgsyiPo&t=917.34s)]
