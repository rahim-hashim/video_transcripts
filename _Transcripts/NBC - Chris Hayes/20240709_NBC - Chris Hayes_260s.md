# 'Drill, baby, drill' Trump’s Project 2025 would gut all U.S climate policy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8)
*  Just about everywhere you look right now, climate change staring us in the face, melting our faces in fact. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  Hurricane Barrel, that is the earliest Category 5 and Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on record ever in recorded history, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=6.0s)]
*  ripped through the Caribbean last week before flooding Houston and knocking out power to millions of Texans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=14.0s)]
*  Right now, 160 million people nearly half the country are currently under some kind of heat alert. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=21.0s)]
*  Las Vegas hit 120 degrees, Phoenix hit 118, Portland, Oregon 102. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=28.0s)]
*  Just to be clear, all three of those are all-time records for each of those cities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=35.0s)]
*  It's hot enough to melt crayons just by leaving them in the Vegas sun. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=40.0s)]
*  It's not going to break until later this week. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=45.0s)]
*  Now, for decades, as you know, conservatives and Republicans have lied about climate change. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=48.0s)]
*  There's no other way to put it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=53.0s)]
*  That it's not happening or that it is happening, but it's natural or that actually no, the world is cooling. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=55.0s)]
*  All kinds of nonsense. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=60.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=62.0s)]
*  Things have finally gotten to the point in the last few years, particularly like the last year or two, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=63.0s)]
*  where they've just run out of room for those lies. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=67.0s)]
*  Like, you just can't do it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=70.0s)]
*  Republicans cannot tell you the world is not getting hotter because it very obviously is. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=72.0s)]
*  And so now they're just trying to like yada yada yada their way out of it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=76.0s)]
*  That is why Donald Trump had no answer when asked about climate change at the debate. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=81.0s)]
*  Former President Trump, you've vowed to end your opponent's climate initiatives, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=87.0s)]
*  but will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=97.0s)]
*  How close the police are to him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=100.0s)]
*  Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=102.0s)]
*  Almost every police group. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=109.0s)]
*  38 seconds left. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=110.0s)]
*  President Trump, will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=111.0s)]
*  So I want absolutely immaculate, clean water, and I want absolutely clean air. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=117.0s)]
*  And we had it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=123.0s)]
*  We had H2O. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=124.0s)]
*  We had the best numbers ever. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=125.0s)]
*  And we did. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=128.0s)]
*  We had H2O. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=130.0s)]
*  That's his response. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=131.0s)]
*  So that's why the word climate isn't even mentioned once in the Republican 2024 party platform. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=132.0s)]
*  They have no plan to combat climate change. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=137.0s)]
*  Well, that's not true. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=140.0s)]
*  They are going to actively try to stop and sabotage the incredible progress being made right now in green energy sources, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=141.0s)]
*  thanks largely to the Biden administration. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=149.0s)]
*  Look at this map from the Energy Information Administration. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=151.0s)]
*  All those yellow spots are utility-scale solar units. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=154.0s)]
*  The green ones are wind, all coming online by next spring, in the next year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=157.0s)]
*  New data shows that back in March, wind power generation, the black line here, overtook coal for the very first time in history. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=163.0s)]
*  With solar, that blue line not very far behind. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=171.0s)]
*  The proposed Republican Party platform says nothing about promoting green energy, just they want to drill baby drill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=174.0s)]
*  And in Project 2025, the big blueprint for actually governing, the priority is to oppose eyesore windmills billed at taxpayer expense, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=181.0s)]
*  support repeal of massive spending bills like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs and Inflation Reduction Act that they acknowledge are providing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=189.0s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to renewable energy developers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=196.0s)]
*  But it gets worse. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=200.0s)]
*  Not only do they want to actively destroy this incredible growing industry, employing millions of Americans that could pull off the greatest energy transition [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=202.0s)]
*  since the Industrial Revolution, not only do they have no plan to mitigate the effects of climate change we see all around us, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=209.0s)]
*  they want to actively make it worse by undoing all climate regulations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=216.0s)]
*  Or as Project 2025 puts it, the Biden administration's climate fanaticism will need a whole of government unwinding. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=221.0s)]
*  There are a few areas where it's just so starkly clear what the choices are in November and climate is one of them as we watch the world cook. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMhUoPAuQ8&t=229.0s)]
