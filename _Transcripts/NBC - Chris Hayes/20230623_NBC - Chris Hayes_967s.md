# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 22
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Special counsel Jack Smith has just turned over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=0.0s)]
*  the first tranche of evidence in the classified documents case against Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=4.88s)]
*  The ex-president's legal team now have access to discovery materials, including evidence obtained [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=9.52s)]
*  through subpoena and search warrants, transcripts of grand jury testimony in both Washington, D.C., [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  and Florida, witness interviews conducted through last month, and excerpts of closed-circuit television [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=20.8s)]
*  footage, also included the grand jury testimony witnesses who will testify for the government at [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=26.24s)]
*  this case. Now, all of this is a routine part of the process following Trump's indictment earlier [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=32.4s)]
*  this month on 37 felony counts. It underscores the surreal current state of affairs. Donald Trump is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=37.92s)]
*  the ex-president of the United States. He is the current front-runner for the Republican nomination, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=44.4s)]
*  and he is a criminal defendant in a federal criminal case entitled to exactly the same [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  amount of due process as all citizens under the Constitution. All of those things, being true at [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=54.32s)]
*  once, is a real test for our usual rhetoric about the rule of law. Because it's one thing to say in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=60.56s)]
*  the abstract, no one is above the law, it is another to actually carry that out. And the task [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=66.32s)]
*  of carrying that out, of making it concrete, falls chiefly to Jack Smith. He is, by many accounts, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=71.68s)]
*  an experienced independent force, as former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told me on the night [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=77.6s)]
*  the news of the indictment first broke. I've known Jack Smith for a good number of years. He's a serious, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=83.12s)]
*  sober-minded prosecutor who is not going to be deterred by anything that Donald Trump throws at him. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=90.56s)]
*  Most of the discussion around Jack Smith's experience is focused on his previous work [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=98.0s)]
*  at the Department of Justice, where he led the Public Integrity Unit that investigates [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=101.44s)]
*  officials accused of corruption. You may have also heard that he prosecuted war crimes at The Hague, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=105.28s)]
*  and seen these images, the ones we use, where he is dressed in the customary black and purple [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=110.8s)]
*  robe. But you may not know, I really didn't until recently, is that Donald Trump is actually the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  second president that Jack Smith has indicted. Now, this story begins 25 years ago with the War [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=124.64s)]
*  of Independence in Kosovo. Following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, a group of rebels known [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=131.44s)]
*  as the Kosovo Liberation Army fought for the freedom of their province from the Republic of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=137.12s)]
*  Serbia. And it was a very bloody conflict. It ended only when NATO intervened by bombing targets [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  in Serbia. In the years that followed, as you may know, the international legal community focused [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=149.12s)]
*  on the war crimes from that era, and they mainly focused on the former Yugoslavian president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=154.96s)]
*  Milosevic in Kosovo and throughout the Balkans. But in 2008, accusations of war crimes on the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=160.8s)]
*  Kosovan side emerged in a tell-all book written by a Swiss prosecutor. She alleged the Kosovo Liberation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  Army, or the KLA, that was the rebels that were fighting, had also committed torture, that they [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  had even harvested organs from Serbian prisoners. After the Council of Europe published evidence of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  some of those same claims in 2011, a special court was set up at The Hague specifically focused [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=188.4s)]
*  on those crimes. And seven years later, in 2018, Jack Smith arrived to take over what was called [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=194.8s)]
*  the Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor's Office. Now, by that time, when he arrived in 2018, the court's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=201.68s)]
*  efforts had largely stalled. It was kind of a more abundant investigation. I mean, at this point, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=207.6s)]
*  it had been nearly two decades since the actual war, and the war crimes had been committed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=213.44s)]
*  And crucially, the former leaders of that rebel army, the KLA, were now in charge of the newly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=217.84s)]
*  independent country. One of them, Hashim Thaci, rose to become the prime minister, and then the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=224.32s)]
*  president. As one of Jack Smith's predecessors explained, the task at hand was like prosecuting [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=230.88s)]
*  Kosovo's equivalent of Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton. Quote, if you indict these [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=237.28s)]
*  people, you're saying the founding fathers of Kosovo have committed atrocities, and I'm ready [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=242.16s)]
*  to prove it in an independent court with independent judges and rules that apply to everyone. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=246.96s)]
*  Another former head of the Specialist Prosecutor's Office, Clint Williamson, explained that Smith [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=252.72s)]
*  focused on getting witnesses that had contributed to the process earlier to come on board again. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=257.52s)]
*  And then Smith, in his office, focused on the chain of command. Williamson says, quote, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=263.76s)]
*  this is not unlike organized crime prosecutions. A mafia boss very rarely pulls the trigger himself. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  You have to develop the linkages between the trigger puller and the big boss who's giving the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=273.6s)]
*  orders. Well, the work paid off. In June of 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=278.16s)]
*  when Smith's office announced that it was seeking an indictment against the then [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=285.6s)]
*  sitting president of the new nation, Kosovo, Hashim Thaci, and included 10 counts on various [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  war crime charges, including nearly 100 murders and the torture of hundreds of victims. In fact, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=296.16s)]
*  the announcement came while Thaci himself was in midair flying to the United States for a meeting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=302.96s)]
*  with none other than, yes, then President Donald Trump. The two men had met before in New York and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  in Paris, but these were to be formal talks at the White House meant to boost Trump's diplomatic [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=315.44s)]
*  bonafide. Now a source told the Daily Beast, it now appears that prosecutors with their announcement [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=320.24s)]
*  were trying to stop Thaci from using that meeting with Trump to pressure the United States to drop [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=325.52s)]
*  the case against him. After learning of the indictment, Thaci did cancel the visit and return [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=330.72s)]
*  home to Kosovo. A little over four months later, after a judge confirmed the charges against him, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=336.0s)]
*  Thaci resigned from the presidency. He flew to The Hague where he was taken into custody. The man [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  who had been the sitting president of this new nation, a hero, a founding father. And Jack Smith [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  continued methodically plugging away at his work, trying several of Thaci's former allies in the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=354.72s)]
*  KLA. Your honor, this is a case about the conditions required for the fair administration [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=360.64s)]
*  of justice and attempts by the accused to block the path of justice for so many. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=367.44s)]
*  This is a case about what is required to make rule of law a reality. Think of that line. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=375.84s)]
*  Think of that line. This is a case about what is required to make the rule of law a reality. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=382.56s)]
*  Now, even without Jack Smith, who of course has got a new job, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=390.32s)]
*  Hashim Thaci's trial continues in The Hague. It's ongoing. He remains in detention. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  Of course, just like Donald Trump, the former president of Kosovo remains innocent until proven [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  guilty. He is due a process. We do not know the outcome of his trial or what it will be, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=402.8s)]
*  although the Kosovo specialist prosecutor's office has since convicted three other people. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=408.56s)]
*  And with Jack Smith back here in the U.S., it appears that Donald Trump is hoping [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=414.64s)]
*  that he can run out the clock, that he can delay long enough to successfully restore [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=418.4s)]
*  himself to the White House so that he can get rid of this whole thing, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=422.96s)]
*  so that he can declare himself above the law. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=426.08s)]
*  But given his very recent history, it seems pretty clear Jack Smith is committed [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=430.88s)]
*  to not letting that happen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  Crime and homelessness growing in our cities and liberals do nothing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=440.0s)]
*  President Biden can't solve these problems or won't. And if we nominate a lawless, selfish, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=444.88s)]
*  failed politician like Donald Trump, who lost the House, the Senate, and the White House, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  we all know Joe Biden will win again. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  Former Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas announced his candidacy for presidency today, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=458.96s)]
*  presenting himself as an alternative to the ex-president who Hurd says would lose. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=463.2s)]
*  Hurd is just the latest Republican to announce after Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, did you catch [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=467.36s)]
*  that one? Declared he was running in a video that showed him literally running last week. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=472.56s)]
*  And with Florida Senator Rick Scott reportedly threatening to also join the fray, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=477.52s)]
*  there's already a lot of people running. Twelve announced so far, which is one fewer than the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=481.84s)]
*  number of Republicans who'd entered the race by this date in 2015, a number that eventually grew [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=486.8s)]
*  to 17. But this time, with the ex-president holding a consistently strong lead in the polls, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  the question is why? Why is the field getting so big? Why are so many Republicans jumping [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=498.0s)]
*  into the race? Tim Miller served as communications director for the Jeb Bush 2016 presidential [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=503.12s)]
*  campaign as well as spokesman for the RNC. David Plouffe was the campaign manager for [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=508.4s)]
*  Barack Obama in 2008, served as senior advisor of President Obama, and both join me now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=512.48s)]
*  So Tim, let me start with you. You were there the last time. So last time you had, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=517.36s)]
*  Obama's term limited it out, right? So you're not going to have an incumbent president take on. That [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=523.04s)]
*  always, I think, invites a lot of challengers. And there was no massive, formidable behemoth in [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=526.4s)]
*  the world of, on the right, there was Jeb Bush was sort of the early favorite. And there was a lot of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  reasons people thought that. But nothing like Trump. Why are so many people getting in this time around? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=539.36s)]
*  Yeah, Jeb hadn't been in office for a decade when he started running. So he was not, in fact, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=546.72s)]
*  that formidable. I was looking at a number of candidates. I like Jeb the best. But I was [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=550.56s)]
*  assessing the field as wide open as an operative trying to decide who to work for. So that is very [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=554.48s)]
*  much not the case this time. So I think we have two things happening in this election. One is you [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=558.88s)]
*  have a group of people that fit in the grifter slash, you know, maybe if things work out, I can, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=564.32s)]
*  you know, be in the Trump administration category. That's the Vivek Ramaswami's of the world. The [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  mayor, Suarez from Miami, I think fits that bill. And then I think you have a really large and kind [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  of dangerous category of people that are delusional. And I think that is Mike Pence and Nikki Haley. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=583.76s)]
*  Wait a second, a politician who's delusional about their own chances and their own appearance? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=590.72s)]
*  Narcissistic and delusional. I know this is going to be hard to believe, Chris. Watch out. But, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=595.84s)]
*  you know, this is Scott Haley Pence heard, right? And I really think that, you know, my understanding [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  from talking to people around them is that they are, you know, in a bubble of this small minority [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  of Republicans who agree with them. Those are the people they socialize with. You know, those are [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=614.16s)]
*  the donors that they're dealing with. They think they deeply want and are wishing the Republican [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=618.4s)]
*  Party would go back to a candidate like them. And I think they're hopeful that either Donald Trump [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=623.12s)]
*  will, you know, have a heart attack or end up in prison, you know, and things might fall in their [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  lap, you know, or that there is going to be some magic fairy that makes the Republican Party go [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=633.12s)]
*  back to what it was in 1999. And that's just not going to happen. But I think that is that [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=637.84s)]
*  delusion is motivating a lot of these guys. Well, so it's the first one, right, that he has a heart [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=642.24s)]
*  attack or he ends up, you know, in prison that I think, David, you have to explain this contradiction, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=646.24s)]
*  right? Which is that he is obviously the front runner. He's polling like the front runner. No [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=651.68s)]
*  one will attack him, right? Almost no one. I mean, Christie being an exception, they're all very [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=656.48s)]
*  gentle. And yet when you look at people like voting with their feet, people seem to think they [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=660.8s)]
*  have a shot, right? So there's some way you got to explain why those two things are together. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  What's your explanation? Well, I agree with Tim. I mean, some are in it for their future. Some are [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=670.0s)]
*  in it because they're crazy. I mean, listen, the political graveyard is filled with people whose [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=677.76s)]
*  supporters and friends told them what they wanted to hear, not what they needed to hear until the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  voters ultimately were clear on that point. But I do think what you have, though, is, you know, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=686.24s)]
*  Trump's not at 60-65, right? There are enough Republicans out there open to an alternative. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=692.24s)]
*  And when you see some of the focus groups that have been reported on, the qualitative discussion [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=698.32s)]
*  I find even more interesting than the polling, which is clearly there's an opening. Now, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=702.64s)]
*  what's fascinating about this is, listen, there's 20 lifetimes for you now in the Iowa caucuses. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  But once we get there, let's just remember, you know, one of the reasons Trump won back in 16 [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=711.76s)]
*  is, you know, Kasich stayed in, Cruz stayed in, Rubio stayed in. And so, you know, listen, if [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=717.28s)]
*  Klobuchar and Buttigieg had waited 48 hours to drop out, you know, Bernie Sanders would have been [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=723.92s)]
*  the nominee. So a lot of this, you know, will come down to after Iowa, maybe after New Hampshire. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=729.28s)]
*  You know, it does just go down to one Trump alternative. But if a bunch of these knuckleheads [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=738.08s)]
*  stay in and split up that vote, that's where his 40 percent looks more formidable. But I think what [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=742.96s)]
*  the people who are serious about this, and I agree with Tim, it's not many, but the people who are [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=748.72s)]
*  serious about it, they're right about it. There's an opening here. Even if Trump doesn't self-immolate [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=752.8800000000001s)]
*  even more, there's clearly, if you can piece this together, there's enough Republican primary voters [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  out there open to someone else. Now, the fact that they're open to someone else and closing the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=764.96s)]
*  sale, of course, are two very, very distinct things. Yeah. And we should say the Emerson polling [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=769.44s)]
*  between April and June shows a little bit of movement in the right direction, right? If you're [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  if you're someone who is a Republican who doesn't want Trump to be the nominee, you know, it goes [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=778.48s)]
*  from 69 to 59. DeSantis picks up a few points. There's some other reasons that this is about [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=782.72s)]
*  whether a third party candidate would sort of spoil that. This is a sort of April to June [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=790.4s)]
*  comparison. But, you know, so there's reason to think there's an opening here. I completely agree. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=794.88s)]
*  And I do think, Tim, like there is this strange waiting for the meteor feeling to the whole field, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=800.16s)]
*  right? Which is just like, look, people like him, you kind of alienate all the people who [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=806.16s)]
*  are trying to persuade if you criticize him because then you're a lib. But like, I don't know, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=812.16s)]
*  maybe like when we get to the fifth indictment or actually like sitting in a courtroom, you know, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=816.32s)]
*  people this'll I mean, that really is what it feels like to me. Well, there's a there's [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=823.36s)]
*  a kind of waiting for media for eight years, like those of them that didn't jump like me, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=828.48s)]
*  Chris. So it's kind of like, eventually, I'm going to be right, you know, eventually some everybody [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=832.08s)]
*  dies, right? So I think, you know, they're they're pot committed, you know, so there's that element [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  to it. Here's the thing, though, and I agree with David in general, that there's an opening for [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=841.6s)]
*  somebody, but the types of Republicans in these focus groups that we do with the bulwark that are [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=845.28s)]
*  open to someone else want someone like Trump. They like Trump. You know, so there isn't an opening [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=850.4s)]
*  for a lot of the people that have gotten in. I think that's the important thing to understand. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=855.52s)]
*  Just the one poll I saw that was relevant in a head to head to see it is that 33 Tim Scott is [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  at 23. And I think that gap tells you a lot, right? If you're a Tim Scott, you've got a really long [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=864.88s)]
*  way to go. And I don't see the opening for people like that. Yeah. Quickly, David on Trump. I mean, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=870.96s)]
*  this is the last thing here is the Santas, right? Who has modeled himself as like, you know, if you [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=878.72s)]
*  like Trump, how about me? But I'm younger and I can I can win. I also think it speaks to perceptions [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  of his weakness that you're seeing all these people get in. Well, no question. I mean, and that is [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=887.84s)]
*  maybe it's not fatal. We'll see. But certainly it's a it's a critical error, which is that he is now [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=894.32s)]
*  created oxygen for a bunch of people, because I still think on paper he is by far the most [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=900.64s)]
*  likely person that Trump's going to get the throne to do it. But he's been been close to God awful [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=906.48s)]
*  to date. But it's not even July 4th. I mean, there is so much time left. We've got to get [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=914.16s)]
*  it. We've got put together. He does seem to be putting together something, you know, DC, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=921.68s)]
*  Cameron and I will see. So I think you're right. I mean, and all these candidates getting in, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  DeSantis has to look in the mirror and say the reason this field is getting more crowded, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=930.64s)]
*  the reason we're probably gonna have debates now over two nights is because I have been awful. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=934.48s)]
*  Just saying that sentence gave me a little flash of PTSD. Tim Miller and David Plouffe. Thank you [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=941.52s)]
*  very much. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjwi5E0HEdo&t=946.56s)]
