# Gaetz pick is like Trump’s ‘fraternity hazing ritual’ for Senate GOP, says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA)
*  I would say near unanimous consensus among members of Congress who know and work with Matt Gaetz is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's just an absolutely horrible person that he's a living breathing troll with no real principles who only cares about himself [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=6.22s)]
*  And I'm just saying that I don't know the guy. I'm just saying members of his own party despise him [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=13.84s)]
*  Senate Republicans responsible for confirming him are going public with their concerns [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=19.0s)]
*  I [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=23.4s)]
*  Will say that was a pick that was I think very surprising to the entirety of the Senate [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  And so we'll assess the nominee on the merits [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  But but there's a process that will unfold that examines a a particular nominees [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=32.96s)]
*  Background their experience and their suitability for a role. Do you have any concerns about someone who's been accused of sex trafficking? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=38.36s)]
*  possibly leading the Department of Justice [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=45.72s)]
*  Well, just to name one I mean Matt Gaetz comes to mind I have concerns about him about the way he [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=48.12s)]
*  He disrupted and just really destroyed the House of Representatives for several months [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=55.28s)]
*  what he did to a really good speaker and Kevin McCarthy and accomplished nothing except getting rid of him and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=60.28s)]
*  You know ruin the reputation of the House of Representatives. What was your immediate reaction when you heard it was Matt Gaetz? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=66.8s)]
*  laughter [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=72.28s)]
*  That's right. That was literally my immediate reaction [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=73.92s)]
*  Now I think Gaetz is probably the most dangerous and alarming of Donald Trump's picks so far because of the particular powers of the Department of Justice [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=77.76s)]
*  But most of these nominees are a lot of them some of them are whatever fine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=85.32s)]
*  They're what you would expect and whatever he won the election [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=88.72s)]
*  He gets to nominate people but you've got Gaetz Fox weekend host Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=91.8s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard for director of National Intelligence and now RFK jr. For health and human services [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=97.16s)]
*  these are not really credible candidates for these jobs and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=102.0s)]
*  It seems to me that they have been chosen with the goal of trying to break our institutions in constitutional order. I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  Mean again, this is not like a partisan or ideological point Republicans [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=113.36s)]
*  Get elected they nominate people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=117.54s)]
*  Those are people who don't have my politics some of them don't get confirmed because they're bad some get confirmed because they can get the votes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=119.28s)]
*  But under normal circumstances, I don't think it's crazy to say none of these people would be confirmable by the Senate as the Constitution requires [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  For the president's most important nominees his cabinet [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=132.32000000000002s)]
*  But whether intentional or not, I don't know if it's intentional [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=135.44000000000003s)]
*  The effect here is that Donald Trump is testing his Republican caucus early on demanding a vote to confirm these [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=138.08s)]
*  Wildly unqualified nominees particularly gates who they all hate right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  In an attempt to dominate the legislative branch at a moment when he feels like he has maximum power [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  He just wanted to do whatever he want [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=156.0s)]
*  He basically wants them to crawl through the Capitol in their underwear and eat dog food out of a can in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=157.32s)]
*  front of everyone like some fraternity hazing ritual [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=163.8s)]
*  This is a humiliation exercise and it's meant to either secure their loyalty or just break the system so he could rule unfettered [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=167.76s)]
*  Sherrilyn Eiffel holds the Vernon Jordan chair in civil rights at Howard University where she is the founding director of the 14th Amendment Center for law and democracy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=177.12s)]
*  She previously served as the president director counsel of the NAACP legal defense fund and she joins me now [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=184.28s)]
*  It's good to have you here. Good to be here. So one of the challenges always is focus because our focus our attention is our most valuable resource [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump yeah tears it from us. So you've got a million things to process [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  I put gates in its in a in a focus category that it's all its own [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=203.4s)]
*  Because of the Department of Justice. Do you feel the same way? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=209.04s)]
*  Well, I'm a lawyer and the Department of Justice is one of the most important agencies in the federal government [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=212.32s)]
*  I feel [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=218.0s)]
*  compelled to point out that the Department of Justice was created in 1870 for the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=220.0s)]
*  federal government to have a legal arm to protect black citizens and so this is a perversion of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=224.6s)]
*  The department itself, but the department is also an agency with a hundred and fifteen thousand employees [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=230.4s)]
*  and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=236.68s)]
*  Usually the person who sits at the head of the Department of Justice is someone eminently qualified as a lawyer [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=238.36s)]
*  In skill and experience and in character Matt Gates is none of those things [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  This is someone who's not even practiced law for 20 years [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=248.68s)]
*  This is someone who was suspended at one point from being able to practice law [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  This is someone who has a terrible reputation among his colleagues who is not distinguished in any way [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  Let alone before the bar and this is a trolling exercise, but I think Trump's doing some other things here, too [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=262.24s)]
*  I think you're right about dominating his colleagues [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=268.0s)]
*  But you know Trump never does anything that he has to do in his first term Trump [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=270.12s)]
*  Nominated some people to his cabinet who at least were competent [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=277.04s)]
*  You might not have liked them and you might not have even agreed with the way they executed the job [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=280.36s)]
*  whether it was his chief of staff or his [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=284.52s)]
*  Secretary of state and so on and so forth [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=287.44s)]
*  He felt at that time that he had to at least meet some modicum of normality [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=289.44s)]
*  And so there were people like Mnuchin and others who calmed people down [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=294.68s)]
*  Yes, but now Trump knows that he doesn't have to do that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  He knows that one because he got reelected again [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=301.84s)]
*  Which means all the shenanigans that he engaged in including his felony convictions including the attack on the Capitol [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Did not faze the public from being able to support him [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=311.44s)]
*  In fact, it appears he may have won the popular vote this time around [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  But the Supreme Court also told him that whatever you do as president [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=318.32s)]
*  Essentially that can credibly be called an official act is not something you can be held accountable for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=323.72s)]
*  So Trump is only going to do those things. He has to do he no longer has to pick [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  Cabinet members who pass the smell test [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=335.6s)]
*  He can have fun with this and he can evaluate his Republican colleagues by seeing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  What they will take what they will tolerate from him and we saw some of them [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=343.64s)]
*  We saw Lindsey Graham last night saying give Matt Gaetz a chance [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=348.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean this to me is is he this is a real test [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=352.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's a test. It's a test with greater stakes. Yes with very high stakes because I don't think that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=355.84s)]
*  You you can even argue RFK. I think is a terrible pick who can do genuine damage [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=362.64s)]
*  You can even argue that like well, he he told us he was gonna let our cable wild on health, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=368.28s)]
*  Matt Gaetz a DOJ is like [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=373.92s)]
*  No one wants it. Yeah, I'm gonna add the Secretary of Defense nominee [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=375.92s)]
*  the Fox News [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=381.64s)]
*  Commentator as well because this is someone who weekend host [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=383.32s)]
*  important distinction [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=387.36s)]
*  This is someone who? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=388.84s)]
*  You know, it is known to be a white supremacist known to be an extremist [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=391.32s)]
*  Whose platform whose book is basically about his opposition to the advancement of black? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=396.28s)]
*  Officers to the top brass and the military is actually very important area for black advancement [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=401.56s)]
*  And so him selecting that particular person and by the way, the Department of Defense has three million employees [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=407.58s)]
*  There's no evidence that this man has ever run anything. The fact that he is a veteran is simply insufficient [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=412.82s)]
*  And so those two because these are two very very important positions strike me as eminently dangerous and you're right [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=418.02s)]
*  It takes our attention [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=425.06s)]
*  But it also demands our attention because it shows us that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=426.86s)]
*  Trump has gone off the rails and he was never really on the rails [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=430.78s)]
*  But there is an even heightened sense of impunity about him now that should alarm us [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  I would just say that Hegseth would say that he would deny strenuously. He's a white supremacist [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=439.74s)]
*  He has I just want to so did Trump put that in the record. He has tattoos [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=444.18s)]
*  that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=449.3s)]
*  garnered the attention of essentially National Guard commanders when he was going to be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=451.3s)]
*  Sent on the mission to guard the 2020 inauguration Joe Biden and we hold from that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=456.42s)]
*  He says because he was identified as an extremist in part because of those tattoos. He thinks it's crazy [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=461.02s)]
*  I just want to like give the full side of the story. But if you've read what he's written about [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=466.3s)]
*  The people in the military about gay people in the military about women in the military about black people in the military [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=471.66s)]
*  Especially in supervisory positions. He is an extremist. That is absolutely true. And [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=477.65999999999997s)]
*  And it's a it's a it's the world's I mean again [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=483.42s)]
*  Again take ideology aside and all that stuff. It's the world's it is the most complex [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=487.18s)]
*  powerful and lethal [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=494.38s)]
*  Bureaucracy in the history of human civilization on the planet. Yeah is an accurate description [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=495.82s)]
*  Yeah of the entity that he is being nominated to exactly and so that's really where we need to be [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=501.54s)]
*  It's that it's not that you're nominally qualified and you have some [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=507.18s)]
*  Unpopular views this is someone who's never run anything. This is someone who I feel comfortable [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=511.52s)]
*  Saying that at least for me white supremacy and your opposition to diversity in the military is a deal-breaker [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=517.92s)]
*  As someone to lead the military, I understand for Donald Trump that it's not but one of the things we have to do [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=524.8s)]
*  Chris is stand on what we know to be true and what we believe because a lot of what Trump does is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=529.92s)]
*  He confuses us. He overwhelms us. I mean this week alone has been overwhelming [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=535.72s)]
*  All of us intentionally so intentionally so and what we can do [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=540.92s)]
*  Chris is we can end up losing sight of what we know to be true of what we believe of what your parents taught you [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=544.84s)]
*  And mine taught me and what we're teaching our children [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's one of the challenges for us in this moment is to hold on to that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=553.24s)]
*  We get to call a spade a spade we get to call a thing a thing [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=556.44s)]
*  Matt gase is incompetent to be attorney general peter hagseth is incompetent to be secretary of defense [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCjst9xMJA&t=559.64s)]
