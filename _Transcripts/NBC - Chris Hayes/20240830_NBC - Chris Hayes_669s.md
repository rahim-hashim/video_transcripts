# Trump says he will vote against abortion rights in Florida
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k)
*  Alexi McCammons and MSNBC local analyst and host of the upcoming in sync with Alexi podcast [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=0.0s)]
*  Fashkir serves as senior advisor to Senator Bernie Sanders as executive director of the nonprofit more perfect union [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  They join me now and I want to we've got some news that just broke on the campaign literally just [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Ten minutes before I went to air [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=17.6s)]
*  About Donald Trump and abortion so you might remember yesterday my colleague Dasha Burns interview Donald Trump about the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  The [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=26.3s)]
*  referendum in Florida that would uphold abortion rights. It's on the ballot this fall [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=28.3s)]
*  It would secure abortion rights in that state [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=32.9s)]
*  It would overturn the six-week ban that was signed into law by Ron DeSantis when asked by Dasha Burns yesterday [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=34.86s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't actually answer the question [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=41.1s)]
*  but seemed to indicate that he was going to vote for that piece of that referendum as a voter in the state of Florida uphold [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=43.540000000000006s)]
*  abortion rights and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=50.46s)]
*  avalanche of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=52.14s)]
*  Pushback and anger from the anti-abortion right came his way after that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=54.18s)]
*  And so he was asked about it today after his campaign sort of walked it back. He was asked about it today [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=58.0s)]
*  And I think we have the clip. Here's what he said today [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=63.34s)]
*  So I think six weeks you need more time than six weeks [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=67.38s)]
*  I've disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=71.18s)]
*  I disagreed with it at the same time the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=75.0s)]
*  So I'll be voting no for that reason [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  So just to be clear Alexi this is news now he's on the record so he said he seemed to say I'm not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=86.38s)]
*  I'm gonna vote yes on this referendum. I'm gonna vote secure abortion rights. I think the six-week ban is bad. He got hammered [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=92.62s)]
*  Like over 24 hours walked away from it has now done an apparent 180 today. What do you make of it? I [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  Think it's incredible that anyone in the media can have a conversation about Kamala Harris allegedly flip-flopping on anything when Donald Trump is giving us a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=105.94000000000001s)]
*  Masterclass in the last 24 hours in like the literal definition of flip-flopping but worse than that Chris [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  It's another example of the central question. We have to ask ourselves not just with Trump as a candidate [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=120.5s)]
*  But God forbid he becomes president again [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=125.94000000000001s)]
*  Is women's health to him a political tool or a genuine policy proposal when he's talking about anything from abortion [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=128.18s)]
*  To I don't know the government now suddenly paying for people to use IVF [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=135.38s)]
*  Which I would I would implore him to actually explain whether he even knows what that procedure is or what it entails [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=138.94s)]
*  It's a disaster. I think the one thing is clear [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=144.74s)]
*  Nobody should believe anything he says because he'll listen to whoever talks to him last and apparently this time it was [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=147.54s)]
*  Marjorie Dannenfelzer from the SBA list [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=153.42s)]
*  Well and on that last point I agree with you know, I mean it's all BS right it's just quintessentially like there's words coming out [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=155.78s)]
*  It's like oh you guys like IVF now about free IVF like he does it's just like whatever [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=161.26s)]
*  But the one thing that is clear here faz and the reason I think you probably could like [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=165.82s)]
*  Hear the cheers go up in the in the Harris Walls campaign is that the one thing that is clear is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=169.66s)]
*  He made a promise to get elected in 2016 to the anti-abortion movement that he would choose [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=176.26s)]
*  Justice is their overturned row from a pre vetted list. He then unlike almost every promise he's ever made in his life [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=181.98s)]
*  Miraculously kept that promise they overturn row and the last 24 hours shows that there's one group [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=190.1s)]
*  The guy won't double cross that he won't screw over that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  He will just bow before and that is the anti-abortion forces in the Republican Party [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=199.5s)]
*  That and Chris, I mean pulling us back out you get this but let's be clear [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  Why are we talking about IVF? Why are we talking about the Florida abortion measure? Why? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=209.38s)]
*  Donald Trump the arsonist [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=215.14s)]
*  Created a fire we trust the arsonist to put it up [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=217.22s)]
*  Who cares what his position on his IVF is we created this problem his Supreme Court? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=219.77999999999997s)]
*  Justices put us in this position. I'm gonna ask the arsonist to come in say hey, you know [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=225.7s)]
*  We got this major fire here wondering what you would make of burning this part down and burning that down [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  We got to move on from him and we're having sometimes a bit of a too much of a rational debate about [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=234.84s)]
*  Whoa, he came out with this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=241.16s)]
*  interesting position on IVF [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  He's trying to win an election and he's lying to people and he's trying to deceive you here on abortion [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  He's trying to move on Florida in every which way can't figure out where he's supposed to be trying to win an election [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  I got it. But for those of us who care about women's rights [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=256.2s)]
*  Reproductive rights just be clear who started this fire that we are all still living in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=259.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great point it's also like it's also worth reminding people that there are [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=265.68s)]
*  Whatever people say on campaigns like there are two major parties that actually do stuff and they actually vote on stuff [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=270.64s)]
*  They pass things like Donald Trump appointed the three justices that overturned row after promising to do so also [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=276.04s)]
*  There was a vote this year. In fact in the United States Senate of all places one of the places that makes the laws of the nation [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=281.4s)]
*  to basically mandate IVF treatment [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=288.56s)]
*  For Americans under insurance Senate Republicans blocked the bill on the right to IVF as Democrats made a push on reproductive care [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  It only got two Republican votes [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  Alexi Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins of Maine [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  Voted for it, but everyone including JD Vance who's on the ticket voting against it. So like [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  There's no daylight here. But I mean like [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=310.36s)]
*  Everyone knows I think who knows this seriously knows like who's on what side? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=314.4s)]
*  Who's on what side and also just like the number of times Trump continues to lie any given time [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=319.96s)]
*  He opens his mouth to give a speech or comments to the press or anything [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean that can't and shouldn't be discounted the man is going so far as to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=329.56s)]
*  Evolve from fake news in 2016 to now claiming that there are AI crowds and images of AI crowds being created at Kamala [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=334.88s)]
*  Harris's events because he is so not living in the same reality and the facts do not lie [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=342.88s)]
*  And the facts do not matter to him and that is a problem whether it comes to women's health or otherwise [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  And I just feel like we cannot state that enough the man lies so much that we don't keep up with it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=353.24s)]
*  So sort of to faz's point to who cares what he has to say when he started this fire and also [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=358.86s)]
*  Yeah, when she doesn't even believe the words or know the words that are coming out of his mouth half the time. He's saying them [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  That that's that's a good point that it's like it's even that this is and I think this is in a real conundrum [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=370.92s)]
*  Right. You see this in campaign coverage faz where it's like it's past lies even it's just it's just the sort of meaningless [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=375.76s)]
*  addled prattle of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=381.36s)]
*  Salesman schtick and patter combined with like maybe cognitive decline brought in by age [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=383.56s)]
*  But there's no like semantic. There's no propositional content the whole thing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  Well now we get into Trump and why he's uniquely dangerous in American politics because he's so deeply amoral has no vision of right [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=393.84s)]
*  And wrong and anything and only what can aggrandize him to his own power [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  So therefore he will create false realities for his own followers [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=404.48s)]
*  He'll tell them a cooked up economic stats and it's all false [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=409.16s)]
*  They're feeding you lies and then it's like saying okay where democracy doesn't even work because they're creating fake crowds for Kamala [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=412.8s)]
*  He's he's creating [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  a false reality for his followers, which of course then goes to then [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=421.6s)]
*  the election which is if he loses how does he talk about a [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  Rational loss a logical loss. He doesn't write he he's seeding this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=433.16s)]
*  so he's so I see of distrust in the very institutions and democracy around and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=437.06s)]
*  Telling people honestly and openly that you know, this is the last time you got a vote, right? What was that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=443.16s)]
*  People he's people read between the lines and that he's he's building a reality that is dangerous for for all of us in democracy [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  I [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=455.48s)]
*  Alexi I found myself pretty disgusted by these comments about Kamala Harris [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=457.6s)]
*  Like she's not smart is what Trump said and and the JD Vance posting [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=463.24s)]
*  I think it's gross [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  but I it also strikes me a little counterproductive because [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  You know that you're making her out to seem so ridiculous and then she does interview. It's like, alright [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=472.0s)]
*  That's a that's a vice president United States knows what she's talking about. She wants to do in a debate [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=476.56s)]
*  I'm not quite sure it's such a tactically brilliant move [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=480.14000000000004s)]
*  Oh [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=482.62s)]
*  And it's in such contrast to the interview that Harrison Walls gave last night [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=484.14s)]
*  They had so many opportunities to take potshots at Trump and JD Vance the entire time to remind people [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=487.74s)]
*  Oh, we were being asked about positions. We've evolved on over time because of intellectual curiosity [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=493.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, these folks are doing X Y & Z and yet they don't they try to keep it above the fray [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=499.42s)]
*  I mean, I think it's disgusting to see the sexism the racism that is already coming from that side [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=504.42s)]
*  But I think it'll just remind not just Americans but women who are crucial voters in swing states [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=510.18s)]
*  Oh, these guys have no idea what they're doing on abortion rights [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=516.5s)]
*  They have no idea what they're doing with reproductive rights in general and now they have no idea how to even give respect [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=519.44s)]
*  To the sitting vice president of the United States [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=524.82s)]
*  They have a complete lack of respect for many traditional American institutions or leaders or organizations [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=527.7s)]
*  Like the army like you were just talking about at the start [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=534.3s)]
*  It is completely in contrast not to just traditional Republican Party values [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=537.34s)]
*  But also to I would say the core of America and the American dream at the end of the day [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=541.42s)]
*  Well, and there's also the same way they're trying to sort of blame Jedi mind trick on abortion rights [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=548.86s)]
*  Like we're gonna be the party that protects abortion rights. What they tried the same thing on the sort of pro worker or pro labor [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=553.12s)]
*  label faz [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=559.74s)]
*  You know like JD Vance getting booted as he tells the firefighter yesterday [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=560.46s)]
*  The most pro workers is a similar kind of like audacious gambit [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=564.26s)]
*  Right and you know that we know about the working-class shifts in politics right now [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=569.66s)]
*  And sadly there are too many people in the you know [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  blue-collar working-class people making under $100,000 people without a high school degree who left the Democratic Party that quite frankly we need back and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=576.86s)]
*  To the extent that Donald Trump is gonna win this election [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=584.02s)]
*  It's gonna be people like that who are gonna make an economic decision at the end of the day and I'm hopeful and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=586.82s)]
*  Confident that right now if the election were held today, we're gonna win those people [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=592.02s)]
*  But the way in which Donald Trump has won too many of them is not bit by policies by expressing an anger and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=595.3s)]
*  In an emotional valence that strikes a chord with people who have felt factories closed down for decades [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  Feel like the wages have not gone up feel like they're getting screwed by corporations who are jacking up prices on them [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=609.18s)]
*  And there's an anger and and Trump hits the emotional chord for some of them [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  And it's not to say common needs to turn into an angry person [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=617.9399999999999s)]
*  But I do think we need to have a valence of how to speak to people [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=621.06s)]
*  Particularly as we move into the last few weeks of this coming to come online [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=625.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and who want to know are you? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=629.66s)]
*  Feeling my life and are you upset as I am about trying to rectify what I see as fundamental problems of corporate [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=634.78s)]
*  Wrongdoing and I think you know, we are on the right track [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=641.44s)]
*  But I hope we hit that emotional chord as well as we get the policy chord [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6DsVKe66-k&t=644.48s)]
