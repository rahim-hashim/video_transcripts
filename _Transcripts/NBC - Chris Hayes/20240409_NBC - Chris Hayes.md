# Arizona AG says she won’t prosecute women, doctors under ‘draconian’ abortion ban
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho)
*  The brand new law of the land in the state of Arizona banning nearly all abortions was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=0.0s)]
*  put into effect in the olden times. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  In 1864, when this ban first went on the books, Arizona wasn't even a state. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=7.0s)]
*  In fact, it had just become a territory of the United States one year prior. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=11.24s)]
*  The population of the entire area, which included part of what is now Nevada, was less than [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=16.16s)]
*  10,000 people. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=20.8s)]
*  Less than 250 people lived in Phoenix. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=22.36s)]
*  There were at least three times as many cattle in the territory as there were people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=25.52s)]
*  In 1864, America was made up of just 36 states. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=30.12s)]
*  There was no state of Nebraska or Colorado, Washington, Oklahoma, certainly no Alaska [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=32.96s)]
*  or Hawaii. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=37.12s)]
*  Arizona would not be admitted to the union for almost 50 years. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=38.8s)]
*  We were, of course, still in the midst of the Civil War. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=41.7s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln was president, and he had just signed the Emancipation Proclamation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=43.72s)]
*  The slavery remained legal, would for another year until the 13th Amendment was ratified. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=48.4s)]
*  Of course, African Americans could not vote. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=53.04s)]
*  Women could not vote. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=55.16s)]
*  It took 56 more years for that to change. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=56.16s)]
*  In 1864, we didn't have light bulbs. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=59.4s)]
*  Indoor plumbing was new and rare. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=62.72s)]
*  The number one movie was, well, nothing, obviously. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=64.22s)]
*  There were no movies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  Radio was still decades away. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  But in 1864, Arizona convened its very first territorial legislature and passed a near [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  total ban on abortion. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=75.88s)]
*  It was codified in 1901 and again in 1913 after Arizona became a state. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  Today, the state Supreme Court upheld that very same law, turning back the clock 160 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  years for women in Arizona. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=90.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays, who has said that she will not [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=93.4s)]
*  prosecute any women or doctors under this law. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=97.56s)]
*  It's good to have you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  Let me just start with a legal question, because I think a lot of people are confused. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=102.68s)]
*  How is it possible to unfreeze a law from 1864 and have it be the law of the land? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=107.96s)]
*  What was the question before the Supreme Court and what position did your office take? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=114.16s)]
*  Right, Chris. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=119.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  The legal question was really whether the 1864 territorial total abortion ban, with [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  no exceptions for rape or incest, took precedent or was the law that the Supreme Court should [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=130.28s)]
*  choose over a much more recently adopted 15-week ban, much more recently as in this century, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=139.96s)]
*  a few years ago, the legislature passed that ban. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=148.84s)]
*  We were obviously arguing the 15-week ban, though it is imperfect and had no exceptions [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=152.84s)]
*  for rape or incest, should be implemented if you're going to have to implement an abortion [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=159.88s)]
*  ban over in 1864. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=166.48s)]
*  Law, unfortunately, this Supreme Court, dominated by pretty extreme justices, it looks like, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=168.48s)]
*  chose 1864. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=178.28s)]
*  What does this mean now for the residents of your state? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=182.56s)]
*  Look, Chris, this is an existential crisis for our residents. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  I think millions of Arizonans, men and women, Republicans, Democrats, independents, woke [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=193.16s)]
*  up this morning to a decision that drags us back to 1864. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  I have said I will not prosecute anyone under this draconian law. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=208.68s)]
*  We obviously know that it's going to have a chilling effect on reproductive access, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=215.68s)]
*  reproductive health care access, on abortion access. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=222.4s)]
*  I've already had attorneys general from other states reach out to me to offer their help [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  and had the Vice President of the United States reach out to me today to offer her help. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=233.24s)]
*  This is a crisis for our state and it's chaotic, to be honest with you, but we're going to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=240.24s)]
*  continue to fight this decision by the Supreme Court. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=246.64s)]
*  We're going to do everything that I can as AG and everything is on the table. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=250.24s)]
*  Nothing is off the table. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=256.4s)]
*  We're going to continue to fight this in the courts wherever we can and we're going to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=257.4s)]
*  try to help women in the period, basically, Chris, between now and when Arizona will have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=262.48s)]
*  a ballot initiative on the ballot in November that I believe will allow Arizonans to enshrine [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=268.0s)]
*  reproductive rights and abortion access in our Constitution. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=278.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was just going to talk about the possibility of a remedy polling that we have. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=281.2s)]
*  This is a 2023 polling out of Arizona State. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=285.52s)]
*  62% of Arizonans saying abortion should always be legal with no restrictions or legal with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  some minor restrictions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=294.28s)]
*  I would imagine there will be some polling this week and I would bet that number is probably [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=295.4s)]
*  even higher. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=299.96s)]
*  There is going to be a ballot initiative in the state and that would override this decision, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=301.12s)]
*  right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  Is it a state constitutional amendment? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a constitutional amendment and it would override this decision. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  I really think, obviously, this is a terrible, terrible decision coming out of the Supreme [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=318.44s)]
*  Court here, but this is a political earthquake that I think extreme Republicans are going [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  to regret. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=331.68s)]
*  They're going to regret this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=333.0s)]
*  Come November, I believe that ballot initiative is going to pass. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  I believe Arizonans are resoundingly going to make it clear that they don't want to be [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=339.0s)]
*  dragged back to 1864. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=343.8s)]
*  I believe it makes it very possible that our legislature would be flipped to Democratic [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=346.88s)]
*  and certainly Ruben Gallego, who is running for the United States Senate, could benefit [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=352.88s)]
*  from this as well, as could Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=358.08s)]
*  Yeah, I should note that the president put this statement out today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=365.0s)]
*  ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic case [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=368.56s)]
*  of rape or incest. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=372.52s)]
*  The ruling as a result, the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=374.16s)]
*  to ripping away women's freedom. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, this is going to be an acute crisis though in the next few months. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=381.04s)]
*  You said everything's on the table, but I've got to imagine, I mean, this is now, I think, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=383.92s)]
*  the most extreme ban in the country, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=388.16s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  I think it probably is, Chris, and that's why I'm going to be in communication with [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=393.56s)]
*  my colleagues, my AG colleagues around Arizona, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=401.4s)]
*  to see what we can do with our partner states to help women who probably are going to have [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=407.88s)]
*  to flee Arizona in the next few months. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  There'll be about a 45 to 60 days stay in this decision, we believe, due to another [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=419.12s)]
*  court case. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  We're still going to have this period where abortion care could come to almost a total [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=427.8s)]
*  halt and so we're going to need our surrounding states to take in women who need reproductive [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  care. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=442.24s)]
*  It's really shocking, to my mind, appalling decision out of your state today, Arizona [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=443.24s)]
*  Attorney General Chris Mays. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=449.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for spending some time with us tonight. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOBkuSjNho&t=451.12s)]
