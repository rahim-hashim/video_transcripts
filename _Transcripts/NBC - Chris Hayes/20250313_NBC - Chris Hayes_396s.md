# ‘Nobody thinks it’s okay’: Bernie Sanders says Americans ‘sick and tired’ of Musk, Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU)
*  Raise your hand. What is it like living paycheck to paycheck? Who wants to? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=0.0s)]
*  Hold on, one at a time. I can't. Yes. Well, terrible, all right. Yes. Hungry? Hunger. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=4.0s)]
*  All right, let me get some hands back there. Be loud. We got a hand there. Okay, ma'am. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=11.32s)]
*  Stressful. Stay on that issue, sir. You're not sure if you're going to be able to keep the heat on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=16.44s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=23.68s)]
*  Trying to find a way to plan a meal until your next paycheck comes. Ma'am. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=25.68s)]
*  Forget about buying shoes and clothes for your kids. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=33.68s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont in Altoona, Wisconsin, he joins me now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=42.68s)]
*  Senator, first I just want to ask you about the continuing resolution. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=47.68s)]
*  You just heard Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying he's going to essentially vote for Closer Tomorrow, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=51.68s)]
*  make sure that this bill can get an up or down vote and thereby pass, because Republicans will pass it, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=56.68s)]
*  keep the government open. What is your position on this? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=61.68s)]
*  I'm struggling to vote no. I think the American people are sick and tired of Elon Musk, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=65.68s)]
*  the richest guy in the world running around slashing Social Security veterans programs [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=73.68s)]
*  that Republicans are moving for massive tax breaks for the rich and cutting Medicaid and nutrition, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=79.68s)]
*  moving us to oligarchy and authoritarianism. You've got to draw a line. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=85.68s)]
*  And I think the American people are prepared to stand with those of us who say that, you know what, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=90.68s)]
*  we're a government of the people, by the people, for the people, not the oligarchy, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=95.68s)]
*  and we're not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut food, take food away from hungry kids. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=100.68s)]
*  You've got to stand up. You've got to fight back. You've got to go into the streets. You've got to rally the American people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=105.68s)]
*  I think you can win millions of people, Republicans, Democrats, independents, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=110.68s)]
*  who really do not like the direction in which this country is now going. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=114.68s)]
*  I want to just offer the argument the Senate Minority Leader made, which is that the consequences of a shutdown, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=118.68s)]
*  as bad as things are now, would be even worse because it would essentially hand even more authority to Musk vote Trump to slash away. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=125.68s)]
*  That assumes that there is no resistance. That assumes that millions of people are not standing up and saying, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=134.68s)]
*  you know what, we're a democracy, not an authoritarian society. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=142.68s)]
*  Don't undo the Constitution of the United States. You're not going to throw 83,000 workers off the Veterans Administration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=146.68s)]
*  You're not going to cut the Social Security staff so that elderly people will die [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=155.68s)]
*  while they're waiting to get the benefits that they paid into. You're not going to take food away from hungry kids. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=161.68s)]
*  If you do nothing, you sit back and say it is going to be terrible. And that's right. A shutdown will be terrible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=167.68s)]
*  But our job is to put the onus on the Republican president, the Republican House, the Republican Senate, the people who control the government. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=173.68s)]
*  They are responsible. They've acted in an undemocratic, unprecedented, unilateral way. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=183.68s)]
*  They've given us an offer. Take it or leave it. That ain't the way democracy works. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=189.68s)]
*  I'm curious what your experience has been like in these in these events you've been doing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=194.68s)]
*  I saw you did one in Nebraska in Representative Don Bacon's district around Omaha. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=198.68s)]
*  You did a few. I did think one in Kenosha, one in Altoona. What what what these events have been like? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=202.68s)]
*  They've been extraordinary, Chris. You know, I ran for president. We had very large turnouts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=208.68s)]
*  But to in a non-campaign moment to go to Michigan and find nine or ten thousand people, working class people coming out was far exceeded our expectations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=212.68s)]
*  And I think what that tells me is that that was primarily a working class group of people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=229.68s)]
*  That tells me people are sick and tired of Trumpism. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=236.68s)]
*  Nobody thinks that it's OK for the richest guy in the world to do what he is doing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=240.68s)]
*  People are afraid of the future of Social Security. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=246.68s)]
*  Musk has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=249.68s)]
*  Trump has lied about all of the people 200 years of age who are getting Social Security benefits. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=254.68s)]
*  They're trying to undermine faith in Social Security, which is the most popular and important program the government runs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=261.68s)]
*  People understand that. And what they want is us to fight back and defeat this trend toward oligarchy, authoritarianism and inequality. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=267.68s)]
*  I want to ask about a piece of Senate business today. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=279.68s)]
*  A committee you sit on, if I have this correct, I think it was HELP, was going to have a confirmation hearing for the nominee to run the CDC under Donald Trump, former Republican congressman. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=282.68s)]
*  He was withdrawn just before the hearing happened. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=293.68s)]
*  I'm not quite sure. He seems like he has kind of the same basically anti-vax disposition as Bobby Kennedy at HHS. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=299.68s)]
*  Do you have a clearer read on what's going on there? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=309.68s)]
*  I think what he indicated is that he, I guess, thought that he might not have the votes or the administration thought he might not have the votes on the committee. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=312.68s)]
*  One of two Republicans would have voted against him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=323.68s)]
*  Do you think that the fact that we have now upwards of 280 measles cases, we've got a child who's died of measles, we've got an adult who's died of measles, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=327.68s)]
*  and we've got the secretary of health and human services out there talking up beef tallow fries and talking down the vaccine might be getting into the heads a little bit of the Republican members of that committee? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=336.68s)]
*  I think it, look, the truth is I know that there are Republican members of that committee who are very concerned about Kennedy's views on vaccines. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=347.68s)]
*  But what you have to appreciate, Chris, is in a corrupt campaign finance system, Elon Musk and other billionaires are prepared to spend an endless amount of money against anyone who stands up to them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=357.68s)]
*  All right, Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for making some time on a very busy day. I really appreciate it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=370.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHu0pBBcEU&t=387.68s)]
