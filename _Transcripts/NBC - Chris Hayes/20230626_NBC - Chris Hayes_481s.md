# Ex-Russian Foreign Minister: Don’t underestimate power of Putin’s propaganda
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM)
*  Today, I address you once again, all citizens of Russia. I'd like to thank you for your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=0.0s)]
*  support, your patriotism and your solidarity. This civil solidarity shows that any kind [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=9.28s)]
*  of blackmail is doomed to failure. I repeat, there has been a tremendous coming together [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=18.76s)]
*  of society, a unification of society. And there has been a firm support of the constitutional [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=27.12s)]
*  order. That was a very defiant Vladimir Putin in brief remarks released earlier this evening, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=37.6s)]
*  saying that there has been a tremendous showing of unity in the aftermath of the Wagner revolt. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=44.52s)]
*  This weekend, the Russian president saw the biggest challenge and threat to his 23 year [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  long reign, a serious challenge to his authority that he called blackmail. The Wagner rebellion [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=54.96s)]
*  revealed a major crack in the foundation of Putin's authority. While he has managed to hold on to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=60.64s)]
*  power and expel the leader of the revolt, the events this weekend have shown that Putin's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=65.28s)]
*  authority may not be as stable as it once seemed. Toward the end of the Soviet era, Andrey Kozerev [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=69.52s)]
*  served as a Russian foreign ministry official in the early 1990s. In 1991, he became the first [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=76.16s)]
*  foreign minister of the Russian Federation under Boris Yeltsin. He also served as a member of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=82.08s)]
*  Russian legislature's lower house, the Duma, until the year 2000. At the beginning of the war with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=87.2s)]
*  Ukraine, Kozerev called on all Russian diplomats to resign in protest. Andrey Kozerev joins me now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=92.48s)]
*  Mr. Kozerev, thank you for being with us. You have an intimate knowledge of this that many people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=99.6s)]
*  don't know because you know of the players, you know some of them personally, you know of them [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=105.12s)]
*  otherwise. Vladimir Putin has asserted himself as a leader who provides stability. Like him or not, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=110.72s)]
*  that's what he promises. This Wagner rebellion shows just how much instability exists within his [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=116.88s)]
*  structure of authority. Well, how do you read what has happened? How do you read this rebellion in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=123.12s)]
*  terms of what it says about Vladimir Putin's power and authority? Well, you know, when you look from [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=127.44s)]
*  here, I mean, when you look from a kind of outside with free flow of information, with free flow of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=135.68s)]
*  images, definitely it's a disaster. It would be a disaster for any government, for any president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  But in Russia, I believe, and I suspect it's a little different. Russian population is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  zoned or kind of overwhelmed with propaganda. The sources of information are tightly controlled. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=163.68s)]
*  And the propaganda will now sing the song which Putin just performed in his second kind of address. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  That it's all patriotism, that we are all united and all that. And don't discount the ability of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=190.08s)]
*  propaganda, especially in the country which is ruled with iron fist. He cannot stand against [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=198.96s)]
*  Ukrainian counteroffensive. He cannot stand comparison with Zelensky, who was just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=208.0s)]
*  minutes or have been there, probably still there on the front line, I mean, mixing with the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=219.28s)]
*  soldiers and all that. He cannot do many things, but he can fool, unfortunately, a lot of Russian [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=228.56s)]
*  people. And there are examples, unfortunately, also not only in Russia, of leaders who can do [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=238.72s)]
*  fantastic things, can make fantastic, kind of unbelievable mistakes and defeats, and yet [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=247.6s)]
*  be able to have considerable support of the population, public. So I would not underestimate [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  his ability to have advantage from this situation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=271.76s)]
*  So let's look at what impact this has on Vladimir Putin as a strong man, as someone who is looked [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=280.48s)]
*  up to by autocrats and dictators around the world. Does it weaken his standing elsewhere, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=287.68s)]
*  and does he, if so, does he have to do something to reassert his strength? And is that going to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=293.12s)]
*  happen in Ukraine or where? Well, you know, I think that we learned a lot from this and everybody [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=298.8s)]
*  who watched and continues to follow the events there learns a lot. First of all, we learn [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=309.12s)]
*  that it's a myth that Putin has red lines which he cannot backtrack from. It's a myth. He can [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=318.24s)]
*  backtrack and he can even backrun, so to say, if he feels threatened, if he feels strong force [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=328.88s)]
*  against him, like the Prigozhans, the Wagner group, which is a militarily strong force, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  relatively speaking, of course. And, you know, he can run. He can even run from Moscow. People say [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=349.76s)]
*  that he is not in Moscow or was not in Moscow during the crisis. He flew some place. So that's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=358.4s)]
*  number one. No red lines. He can be defeated. He can be defeated. And he can maneuver after that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  And he can have an agreement or kind of compromise or whatever process [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=379.28s)]
*  after being defeated, humiliated. And again, only if there is a force against him. That's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=388.96s)]
*  number two. And number three is very interesting conclusion also is that he can easily find an [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=399.52s)]
*  offering. So the leaders of the West and people around, you know, like pundits, so to say, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=409.84s)]
*  they could relax in search of face saving for him. You saw his straight face, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=418.56s)]
*  not accepting, not, you know, kind of admitting any mistakes, not admitting an evident defeat. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=426.88s)]
*  So relax. Just give Ukraine weapons to win and nothing will happen. No red lines, no face saving. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=441.28s)]
*  But unfortunately, he could probably stay even after that for a long time there. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL4FEVmXImM&t=452.88s)]
