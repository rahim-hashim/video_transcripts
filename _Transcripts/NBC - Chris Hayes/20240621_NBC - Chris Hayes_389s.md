# Bernie Sanders shreds billionaires backing Trump ‘So greedy’ they’ll do anything to keep power
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4)
*  I'm joined now by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=5.2s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=6.2s)]
*  I do think this, you know, I've heard this from folks, wealthy folks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=7.2s)]
*  The antitrust, the tax stuff, the antitrust stuff, the worker stuff, they really don't [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=12.1s)]
*  like it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  And people don't, I think, quite realize how aggressive this administration has been on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  all of those fronts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=22.48s)]
*  Biden is the first president ever to walk on a picket line during a strike. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  That is a very significant symbolic act. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=29.72s)]
*  Lena Kahn at the FTC has been more aggressive in taking on corporate monopolies than we [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=32.56s)]
*  have ever seen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=38.72s)]
*  Probably in 50 or 60 years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=40.76s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=42.76s)]
*  Both parties have been absolutely negligent in breaking up monopolies. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=43.76s)]
*  Biden wants progressive tax reform at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=48.2s)]
*  the effective tax rate of billionaires is lower than that of nurses and truck drivers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=53.96s)]
*  He wants, correctly, that the billionaire class stop paying its fair share of taxes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=59.92s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=64.68s)]
*  At a time when we have so much greed out there, when the religion of the billionaire class [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=65.68s)]
*  is greed, they would rather give up democracy than take a hit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=70.0s)]
*  That quote really struck me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=75.42s)]
*  The quote that we think Democrats are more of a risk to capitalism than Trump is to democracy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=78.08s)]
*  It really is incredible. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  It shouldn't be shocking, really, but it is, you know, knowing the history of the country [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=85.56s)]
*  over many years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  But these guys are so greedy, so wedded to their wealth and their power, that they will [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=92.28s)]
*  do anything, anything to keep that position. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=97.48s)]
*  But the issue, and I'm glad you're focusing on it, because it's certainly not just Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Trump is just an outrageous example of selling out the money. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's a vessel for them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  But let's be clear, Chris. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=112.92s)]
*  We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care at all. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=115.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=118.2s)]
*  You have a look at the amount of money the insurance companies and drug companies put [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=119.2s)]
*  into candidates. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=122.36s)]
*  Unbelievably, at a time when everybody with a brain in his head understands that climate [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=123.84s)]
*  change is a threat to the planet, guess what? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=129.36s)]
*  This guy Trump wants to deregulate the fossil fuel industry even more and destroy the planet. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=132.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=138.44s)]
*  All these guys are spending huge amounts of money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=139.44s)]
*  You've also got this situation, which is, you know, this has been the case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=141.76s)]
*  Money and politics in the US has worked in all kinds of ways. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=145.72s)]
*  But just reading that quote about Mellon writing the $50 million check and the super PACs, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, the Post Citizens United, you know, the amount that you can give, it really is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  a new thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=158.72s)]
*  It is, you're right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=159.72s)]
*  It's always been there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=160.72s)]
*  It has reached a new level. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=161.72s)]
*  I just came from an event with Reginald Bowman up in the Bronx, and that's a perfect example [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=162.72s)]
*  of this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Bowman is a strong progressive member of Congress who has spoken out on the horrific situation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=168.08s)]
*  in Gaza, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=174.12s)]
*  And they are saying to him, and this, by the way, what the Bowman situation is, is really [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=177.0s)]
*  that they're making a statement to all of Congress. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=182.0s)]
*  You have the guts to take on neocon foreign policy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=185.52s)]
*  You want to take on the corporate interests that are so powerful, tell you what's going [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=189.08s)]
*  to happen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=192.66000000000003s)]
*  You're going to lose. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  And that message goes all over Congress. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=194.66000000000003s)]
*  You stand up for working class people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=196.48s)]
*  Hey, your days are numbered. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  This is oligarchy, and it's an issue that we have got to focus on and deal with. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=200.76s)]
*  Yeah, that primary, which we noted, is the most expensive in American history already. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  There's been about $15 million spent by a PAC, so super PAC. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=209.88s)]
*  Also the crypto people have also gotten it, which has not gotten as much attention. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  The crypto interests, and you saw what happened with Donald Trump says, I mean, it's just [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=218.44s)]
*  like as black and white as you can get. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=223.04s)]
*  I like crypto now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=225.32s)]
*  Give me money. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=227.12s)]
*  And then the crypto people come out and they say, here's some money. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=228.12s)]
*  Thank you for protecting crypto. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=231.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=232.44s)]
*  It's absolutely disgraceful. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=233.44s)]
*  So, I mean, what do we have to do? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=234.44s)]
*  I mean, first of all, it goes without saying that we have got to deal with Citizens United. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  We've got to get rid of that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  And second of all, we have got to do what many other countries around the world do, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=243.88s)]
*  have public funding of elections. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=246.84s)]
*  Look, you want to run against me, that's fine, but you don't have the right to have 50 times [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  more money coming from rich people in order to defeat me. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=253.04s)]
*  We should be debating ideas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=256.84s)]
*  I saw a stat today, and I think this is correct, that, you know, obviously in the UK they're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=258.96s)]
*  about to have an election. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  The amount of money spent on that election so far is less than the New York 16 primary [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  for the nation across all parties. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  So we just do things in a totally different way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=273.96s)]
*  And again, and it is getting worse. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=276.2s)]
*  Your point is, and I want everybody to hear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=277.84s)]
*  When you reduce it to this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=280.48s)]
*  Look, billionaires are doing phenomenally well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=282.2s)]
*  They have never ever had it so good. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=285.24s)]
*  They've got so much money that they're sitting there, hey, let's start a super PAC. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=286.76s)]
*  Let's put $100 million. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=291.76s)]
*  Let's beat that guy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=293.2s)]
*  Let's support that guy because we need more tax breaks. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=294.24s)]
*  Hey, we're only worth $50 billion. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=296.72s)]
*  Harding can get by. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=298.56s)]
*  Corporate profits, I'm sorry. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=299.56s)]
*  This is an issue. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=301.1s)]
*  Look, to anyone out there, we are not going to be able to do what we want to do, deal [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=302.1s)]
*  with climate change, guarantee health care to all people, have a tax system which is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=305.6s)]
*  fair. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  Make sure that our kids do not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any country [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=311.52s)]
*  on earth. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=315.68s)]
*  We're not going to be able to do any of that unless we take on a corrupt campaign finance [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=316.68s)]
*  system which is what you're talking about. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=319.96s)]
*  One of the things that's striking to me too, and I don't know if you agree with me on this, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=322.76s)]
*  but I also think it's short-sighted on the part of the business class because I actually [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=326.32s)]
*  think- I don't agree with you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=330.44s)]
*  You don't agree with it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=331.44s)]
*  I think that they are underestimating the tail risk of a Trump administration and what [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=332.44s)]
*  it would do. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=336.74s)]
*  You think they're going to get- they're going to be alright? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=338.68s)]
*  I think that greed is so incredibly ugly and pervasive that these guys want it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=341.56s)]
*  They want more and more. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=349.2s)]
*  I think they could care less about what's happening to the elderly, the children, the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=351.26s)]
*  working class of this country. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=355.68s)]
*  And I will think- I believe that they will do anything that they can to enrich themselves [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=357.92s)]
*  and Trump is clearly their guy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=363.24s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, it's a pleasure to have you here in person. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=365.52s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be with you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVrETOMjKS4&t=368.36s)]
