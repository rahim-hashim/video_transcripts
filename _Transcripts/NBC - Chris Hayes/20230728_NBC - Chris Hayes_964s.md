# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 27
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM)
*  But joining me now is Laura Jarrett, senior legal correspondent for NBC News, one of the best legal eagles out there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=0.0s)]
*  So Laura, I mean, we've both read this. You are a lawyer. I am not. Tell me, what in this superseding indictment poses the biggest threat to Trump? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=5.5s)]
*  This helps flesh out the prosecutor's story, their theory of the case. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=15.0s)]
*  We had already seen in detail the allegations about him keeping the classified documents of Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=20.0s)]
*  and then trying to scroll them away and hide them once authorities try to get them back. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=26.5s)]
*  This helps provide insight into what prosecutors would talk about as a consciousness of guilt. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=30.5s)]
*  The idea, the allegation, their theory here that he actually attempted to engage in a conspiracy, an agreement with others to delete the security footage. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=35.5s)]
*  There is no reason for you to delete the security footage if you didn't think you did anything wrong. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=46.5s)]
*  And so the prosecutors would want to be able to use that to tell a story to the jury that would make sense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=52.5s)]
*  Now, what stuck out to me a lot in here, but is page 29 in this indictment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=57.5s)]
*  Yes, page 29 is everything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=62.5s)]
*  Page 29 is everything. This has the detail of this conversation in the audio closet. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=64.5s)]
*  It doesn't have Trump, though, his audio recording. It has this implication that Trump wanted this to happen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=70.5s)]
*  So how in a court of law do you prove it? Do they need one of these? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=77.5s)]
*  It seems clear that employee number four here may be working with Jack Smith's team. Is that your belief as well? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=81.5s)]
*  I think that that is certainly an implication that is fair to read from this. He turned over text messages, appeared. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=89.5s)]
*  It's not clear whether there is other some sort of wire or other recording in that little audio. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=94.5s)]
*  How do they get the audio? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=99.5s)]
*  And it's so detailed. It's not an exact transcription, but it would be a lot for employee four, the IT director, to remember all of this by memory. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=100.5s)]
*  And obviously, if prosecutors are going to allege this, they want to be able to back it up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=109.5s)]
*  And so they're going to need to be able to put someone on the witness stand to be able to authenticate that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=112.5s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to put on the IT director who through hearsay is saying, I was told that the boss wanted it done. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=117.5s)]
*  They need some direct evidence. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=122.5s)]
*  So we don't know here. Well, not he obviously hasn't flipped daily. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=124.5s)]
*  Vera, the new defendant. We don't know anything about him flipping clearly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=128.5s)]
*  Do they need one of them in order to make this a strong enough case or could they do it without that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=132.5s)]
*  Well, it certainly would be helpful to them, but I'm not sure that it's essential at this point. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=138.5s)]
*  I know we know from reporting the prosecutors did try hard to get Nata to flip previously before charging him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=142.5s)]
*  And he so far has not shown any indication to doing that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=148.5s)]
*  However, we're still in the early stages of this, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=152.5s)]
*  As far as we understand it, this grand jury is actually still active. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=155.5s)]
*  We don't know other witnesses, other testimony. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=159.5s)]
*  What else is going on down there in Florida? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=162.5s)]
*  Obviously, we were all focused on Washington, D.C. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=164.5s)]
*  We didn't even know about the superseding indictment here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=167.5s)]
*  This is not a bingo card this morning. No, no, we were focused elsewhere. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=169.5s)]
*  But so I think we don't yet know. I think what else they have, what other cards prosecutors have to play here? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=173.5s)]
*  And maybe they don't need Nata or DeLavira to flip. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=178.5s)]
*  It would certainly be helpful if they did, but it might not be essential to proving their case against the former president. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=182.5s)]
*  So one of the charges is about this Iran war plan, this Iran document that Trump is on on audio talking about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=187.5s)]
*  How significant is it that there's audio of him talking about it? Does that matter a lot? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=194.5s)]
*  It was always significant to have the audio and certainly now they have the document. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=199.5s)]
*  And that's that was always sort of a question mark out there because the former president, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=202.5s)]
*  through implication, had almost made it seem like, well, maybe it was just bluster. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=206.5s)]
*  Maybe it was a newspaper. Who knows? No, turns out the document is real and they got it and they got it back. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=210.5s)]
*  And they say when they got it back because he returned the documents to NARA National Archives in January 2022 and detailed here in a handy dandy chart that our Lisa Rubin, our other legal eagle found. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=215.5s)]
*  It explains how long he retained the classified documents illegally, according to prosecutors, and it shows that they actually got the document back. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=228.5s)]
*  And so I think, again, it helps bolster their case to be able to show the jury. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=237.5s)]
*  Here's the document. Here's the recording. Here's you know, it all speaks to his state of mind. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=242.5s)]
*  Lord, you're one of the hardest working women in journalism and legal eagling. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=248.5s)]
*  I think I can say the same in the next 49 minutes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=252.5s)]
*  If any news breaks, just come back. We'll be here till nine o'clock. Thank you so much, Laura. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=255.5s)]
*  I appreciate you joining me. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=260.5s)]
*  Barbara McCade is a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=262.5s)]
*  She's now a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, and she joins me now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=266.5s)]
*  I asked Laura this question, but I want to ask you, Barb, what, as you read this indictment, is the biggest peril? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=270.5s)]
*  What was the biggest legal peril to Donald Trump? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=276.5s)]
*  Well, I think this detail of obstruction of justice about what the boss wants is incredibly important. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=279.5s)]
*  As Laura said, prosecutors refer to this as consciousness of guilt. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=286.5s)]
*  Donald Trump's defense throughout this whole thing has been, I get every right to hold on to those documents. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=290.5s)]
*  If that were true, there would be no need to destroy video of people moving these boxes around. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=295.5s)]
*  And so this really hits home with this obstruction of justice charge. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=301.5s)]
*  Certainly the addition of the Bedminster document is interesting, but it was already in the indictment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=305.5s)]
*  So I think this new obstruction is really fascinating. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=310.5s)]
*  And it would be useful perhaps to have the new defendant flip, but I don't think it's necessary with this employee number four, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=313.5s)]
*  who clearly was in the closet with him and heard what he had to say. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=320.5s)]
*  And so I think this is just really powerful evidence that makes that obstruction of justice scheme really, it seems to me, very difficult to defend against. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=325.5s)]
*  Now, we didn't expect this. Maybe you were, Barb, you could tell us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=337.5s)]
*  But most of us were not expecting this today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=341.5s)]
*  There's one specific document, this Iran War Plan document that's in here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=344.5s)]
*  But there are, of course, a number of other documents that are listed in the original indictment and listed again here that are classified documents. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=348.5s)]
*  Do you think this is the last superseding indictment or could there be more that Jack Smith and his team and the grand jury could be considering? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=354.5s)]
*  You never know. I've had cases I've seen go up to like, you know, seven superseding indictment. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=363.5s)]
*  But I think in this case, there might be a reason to refrain from doing that, even if you thought you could keep adding more evidence. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=368.5s)]
*  And that's the clock, because every time you supersede, there is an argument by the defense that that should push out the trial date. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=375.5s)]
*  We'll see if Donald Trump tries to do that, because we just got that May trial date from the judge in this case, which struck me as a rather reasonable amount of time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=382.5s)]
*  But now with a new defendant who's got to get his lawyer up to speed and Donald Trump will say these are new facts, new allegations, we're going to have to obtain more discovery about all this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=389.5s)]
*  There is a reason to kick that date down the road. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=400.5s)]
*  And so every time you supersede, there is that risk of extending the trial date. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=403.5s)]
*  And in this case, unique to this case is on the other end is, of course, the election. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=408.5s)]
*  And I think prosecutors have to be cognizant that that is a really ticking clock out there. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=413.5s)]
*  So it sounds like they could make an argument to extend the trial date past the May date that Aileen Cannon just set. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=418.5s)]
*  Do you think that's something we could hear more about soon? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=425.5s)]
*  Would that be an ask that the Trump team is going to cannon with in the coming days? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=428.5s)]
*  Or how quickly does that happen? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=432.5s)]
*  I think it will. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=434.5s)]
*  They'll wait for the arraignment of the new defendant first, which will likely take place soon, I would imagine. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=435.5s)]
*  And then shortly after that date, it would seem appropriate for the parties to ask to reset dates in this case in light of additional discovery and that defendant's ability to get up to speed. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=442.5s)]
*  So I would say after the arraignment, I think we should expect in a short period of time a request for additional time. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=453.5s)]
*  So we were waiting for news on a different indictment, of course, this morning, which we didn't receive. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=460.5s)]
*  We received this instead. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=465.5s)]
*  How does this impact or does it impact at all the timeline of the indictment on the effort to overturn the election and Donald Trump's involvement in that? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=467.5s)]
*  I don't think it impacts the indictment that may be filed, which I think is a real certainty that it's coming. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=477.5s)]
*  My guess is it's probably not coming until after those remaining witnesses testify who are scheduled for August. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=483.5s)]
*  So I'm a little less inclined to think it's coming in the next couple of days. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=489.5s)]
*  But I do think there is some significance to the timing here. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=494.5s)]
*  So if the trial date in the Mar-a-Lago case gets pushed out to, say, June or July, I think this one probably trails behind. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=497.5s)]
*  And so every time something like this happens, we could see the January 6 trial getting pushed into late summer, early fall of 2024. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=505.5s)]
*  And, you know, at some point, the arguments that were too close to an election actually has some merit. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=514.5s)]
*  And so I think the prosecutors need to keep the heat on and get these indictments filed. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=519.5s)]
*  We're obviously digesting a lot of news, including this new indictment today, superseding indictment. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=524.5s)]
*  But as we talk as we think about the potential indictment of Trump for his role in trying to overturn the election, do you still expect we're going to see one by the end of this week? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=530.5s)]
*  Well, I have never thought it was going to be coming that soon. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=544.5s)]
*  But, you know, I doubt that they would be pressed up so close against each other, but perhaps next week or later on in August. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=548.5s)]
*  So do you think the news today might also make them want to give some space between it, too, even if they have other pieces they're working on? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=558.5s)]
*  Well, yeah. And I imagine that the special counsel is busy, focused on the addition of these new charges. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=568.5s)]
*  I mean, this thing is like a classic mob prosecution where you start off with a few defendants and the mob boss thinks, well, if it's just one other guy, I'll be able to keep him under wraps. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=575.5s)]
*  He knows that I'm not going to turn, you know, squeal on him. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=590.5s)]
*  He won't squeal on me. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=592.5s)]
*  Then you add another criminal defendant and then it gets iffier. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=593.5s)]
*  You start getting all kinds of prisoner dilemma considerations and then you start to see that the other guy is going to be able to keep him under wraps. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=596.5s)]
*  And then you add a fourth person and then everybody starts looking over their shoulder because you don't want to be necessarily caught on the inside with the mob boss who's really behind the whole thing when you could just as easily tell the truth and get off much more lightly. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=603.5s)]
*  So I think there's tremendous momentum in that prosecution based on the additional charges that were brought today in the superseding indictment. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=620.5s)]
*  And one of them, I mean, in addition to all of the back and forth mob boss language, which unquestionably the audio recording from the from from that's included in the indictment is that is this Iran war document where Trump has already on record or he's on been recorded on audio talking about it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=630.5s)]
*  And now they seem to have it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=649.5s)]
*  What do you think you've seen these documents? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=651.5s)]
*  What's your view on the significance of that? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=653.5s)]
*  The fact that they now have it in their hands. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=656.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's specific documentary proof of Trump's consciousness of his own guilt, his awareness that he was not supposed to have these documents, his his arrogant contempt for the rule of law and his will is boastfulness about having swiped these documents and, you know, the bravada with which he showed them off to his guests in order to impress them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=661.5s)]
*  I mean, a lot of that is just extremely immature stuff. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=688.5s)]
*  But the motive for taking those documents and for harboring them and for not turning them over is irrelevant. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=692.5s)]
*  Really? I mean, it it might become relevant. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=700.5s)]
*  It's sentencing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=702.5s)]
*  But in terms of the legally requisite intent, it's very clear. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=703.5s)]
*  He had the intent to take those documents to pilfer them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=708.5s)]
*  He had the intent to keep them out of view. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=712.5s)]
*  And then he had intent to obstruct justice, apparently by trying to destroy the videotapes that would demonstrate everything that had been taking place with respect to his efforts to hide them. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=715.5s)]
*  So as much as we are all digesting this, you are so deeply embedded in all of the details around Trump's efforts to overturn the election. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=729.5s)]
*  So I wanted to ask you about these new Bernie Kerrick and new significant witnesses that Jack Smith's team wants to hear from and talk to. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=737.5s)]
*  What do you think the significance is of that? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=746.5s)]
*  And what are you hoping to learn from them? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=748.5s)]
*  Well, the Department of Justice, the special counsel, has the full panoply of prosecutorial authorities and subpoena powers that we really did not have as the January 6th committee. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=750.5s)]
*  It's remarkable that we got as much information we did because there were so many people who were shocked and dumbfounded by the fact that a president of the United States would actually be able to do that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=765.5s)]
*  And so there were lots of people, including in the Trump White House and lots of Republicans who came forward to speak. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=776.5s)]
*  But of course, there were people who are far more on the culpable side who did whatever they could not to testify before our committee. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=782.5s)]
*  And those are the people that Jack Smith is going to be able to bring in to the committee. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=791.5s)]
*  So, you know, Mark Meadows would be one of them because he, you know, had one foot in and one foot out with the committee. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=797.5s)]
*  But he clearly had a very clear understanding of what was taking place not just on January 6th, but in the run up to the end of the year. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=805.5s)]
*  And so I think that's a very important point. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=814.5s)]
*  And he had a very clear sense of what Donald Trump's purposes were. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=817.5s)]
*  And he probably has a pretty good sense of how exactly they planned to get Pence to step outside of his constitutional role and either to declare Trump president or to kick the whole presidential election into the House of Representatives. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=823.5s)]
*  And he probably has a pretty good sense of how exactly they planned to get Pence to step outside of his constitutional role and either to declare Trump president or to kick the whole presidential election into the House of Representatives for a so-called contingent election where we would be voting on the basis of one state, one vote, which even if they lost Wyoming with Liz Cheney would produce a majority for them. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=834.5s)]
*  I mean, to your point, Congressman, Mark Meadows was there for all of it, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=860.5s)]
*  He was the chief of staff in the room for a lot of this. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=863.5s)]
*  We have the text messages thanks to the work of the January 6th committee. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=866.5s)]
*  And recently in the last couple of days, Governor Christie, who's prosecuted a lot of these cases, said that he's acting like a cooperating witness. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=869.5s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=878.5s)]
*  Well, Mark Meadows is a fascinating character, and I think the historians will have a rich source of material in him. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=883.5s)]
*  I mean, you know, lots of the people we spoke to on the January 6th committee basically said that Mark Meadows was kind of like a mirror or a parrot of whatever they were saying. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=894.5s)]
*  If they said, this is awful, we've got to stop it, he would commiserate with them and nod along and so on. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=906.5s)]
*  But if it were Trump and other people were in the inside of the conspiracy, he seemed to go along for the ride. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=912.5s)]
*  It would be fascinating to have some people testify about what he actually was doing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=918.5s)]
*  And so it's unclear. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=924.5s)]
*  But I'm with you that if you were actually to recount with candor what took place, it would be extremely revealing as to Trump's actual movements and the directions, the calls that he was making on January 6th and January 5th. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=926.5s)]
*  . [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGP77hGxEM&t=956.5s)]
