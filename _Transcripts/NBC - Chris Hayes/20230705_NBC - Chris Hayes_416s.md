# Trump-appointed judge rules against Biden admin in Facebook censorship case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc)
*  Yesterday, on the 4th of July, we got a very weird and seemingly sudden ruling from a judge, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=0.0s)]
*  federal judge in the Western District of Louisiana with some broad First Amendment implications. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=6.32s)]
*  The federal judge barred parts of the administration from contacting social media platforms about [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=11.96s)]
*  online content. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=17.88s)]
*  Now, the ruling came in response to a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states alleging [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=18.88s)]
*  that the White House went too far in its efforts to curb content that challenged vaccines or [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=24.26s)]
*  threatened elections. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=29.96s)]
*  So this federal injunction handed down by the judge, as of yesterday, bars key federal [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  agencies including the CDC, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=37.72s)]
*  even contacting social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram over concerns [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=41.56s)]
*  like misinformation on COVID-19. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=46.56s)]
*  And the ruling, the judge accuses the federal government of some pretty heady stuff, saying [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=49.28s)]
*  they were running an Orwellian ministry of truth, suppression of opposition and dissent. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  When you do a little Googling, you quickly discover the plaintiffs, a Republican attorneys [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=59.04s)]
*  general in Louisiana and Missouri, very clearly filed this case in this small district in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  Louisiana because they knew there was a good chance they would get this guy on your screen, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=68.68s)]
*  Judge Terry Doty. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=73.64s)]
*  That's the same judge who blocked the vaccine mandate for health care workers in the middle [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=75.2s)]
*  of a once-in-a-century pandemic. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=81.68s)]
*  Joyce Vance, the former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, now a professor [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=84.08s)]
*  at the University of Alabama School of Law, and she joins me now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=87.8s)]
*  Joyce, I've got to say, I have read most of this opinion and it's a real kind of head [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=91.28s)]
*  scratcher. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=96.6s)]
*  Just take us through what the judge is ordering here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=98.08s)]
*  So the judge in essence is shutting down communication between broad parts of the federal government [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=102.84s)]
*  and the social media platforms. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=110.88s)]
*  And Chris, this is a two-way exchange where the government shares information with the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=112.96s)]
*  private sector about threats and risks and the private sector shares its own information [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=118.24s)]
*  with the government. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=123.6s)]
*  None of us are safer with this sort of exchange shut down. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I can understand and be sympathetic to in the abstract concerns about government [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=128.76s)]
*  coercion vis-a-vis speech platforms like Facebook or Twitter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=134.4s)]
*  It doesn't strike me as crazy, right, that you would have those concerns. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  In this specific case, there's a lot focused on COVID. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=142.74s)]
*  And it was interesting to me this, like, here's Fauci on TV, on MSNBC, it's cited in the ruling, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  talking about hydroxychloroquine. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=156.9s)]
*  All of those trials show consistently that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  treatment of coronavirus disease. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=165.06s)]
*  Now that's true, I mean, and has been true, and is actually importantly true because lots [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=168.58s)]
*  of people were trying it and it wasn't working. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=173.3s)]
*  It's important that you know that it's not effective. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=175.08s)]
*  And then the ruling by this judge says, Dr. Fauci made statements on Good Morning America [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  and on Andrea Mitchell reports that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in treating the coronavirus. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=181.62s)]
*  Social media platforms censored the America's frontline doctor's video on the benefits of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=186.72000000000003s)]
*  hydroxychloroquine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  But there's no, like, causal relationship or even coercion alleged here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  He just seems to be, like, implying it in a federal judicial order. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=198.08s)]
*  You know, I sense your frustration, Chris, and I want to echo it here because the allegation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  is a First Amendment violation by the government, that the government is compelling or restraining [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  speech. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=213.88000000000002s)]
*  And there's none of that, none of that established in this complaint. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  This is a preliminary injunction. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=219.12s)]
*  The plaintiffs, the attorney generals and other parties have to show a substantial likelihood [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  of success on the merits. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=226.24s)]
*  But they can't show that the government was telling these companies that they had to remove [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=228.06s)]
*  speech from their platform just because Dr. Fauci was on television speaking the truth. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=232.36s)]
*  There's also this question that kind of haunts this case when I saw the ruling, which is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=239.7s)]
*  the sort of forum shopping problem. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=244.06s)]
*  We saw it's most famously been a problem with Judge Kazmarek, who is a district court [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=247.1s)]
*  judge in Amarillo, Texas, where the plaintiffs who wanted to get Miffl-Pristo and taken off [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=251.46s)]
*  the shelves went and they not only sued, but they tried to get a nationwide injunction. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=257.32s)]
*  They succeeded in issuing a nationwide injunction. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=261.78s)]
*  It was later stayed by a circuit court that would cut access off for people across the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=264.52s)]
*  country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=269.78s)]
*  It just seems like a very clear playbook here to file this suit in this part of Louisiana [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=270.78s)]
*  knowing you're getting a guy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=275.92s)]
*  And I wonder what you think of it as this sort of loophole jurisdiction hacking that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=277.08s)]
*  we're seeing increasingly. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=283.48s)]
*  Yeah, so I think this situation is a little bit different. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=286.0s)]
*  I mean, I think you're absolutely correct to point out that they sought this particular [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=289.04s)]
*  judge out because they were aware that he had granted a series of injunctions in COVID [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=293.64s)]
*  vaccine cases, and he seemed to have a lot of animosity towards vaccines and the government's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=299.04s)]
*  approach to COVID in general. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=303.7s)]
*  But this is a judge who was confirmed 98-0 in the Senate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=305.92s)]
*  He's someone who was well qualified. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=310.64s)]
*  The ABA rated him that way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=312.44s)]
*  He had been both a prosecutor and a state court judge. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=314.1s)]
*  He seems to have an issue in this one area. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=317.54s)]
*  And what you would expect to happen is that the Fifth Circuit would reverse him very quickly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=321.66s)]
*  But the Fifth Circuit, of course, has become an uber conservative circuit, and whether [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  or not they will do that remains to be seen. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  There are a lot of problems with this order, not the least of which is that the plaintiffs [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=334.26000000000005s)]
*  don't seem to have standing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=338.26000000000005s)]
*  That basic doctrinal hurdle that parties have to pass to be in court. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=339.98s)]
*  There are so many flaws in this case, whether the Fifth Circuit takes it on remains to be [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  seen. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we should know the Fifth Circuit is also the appellate court for Judge Kesmerick, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  and there's lots of people who feel like the Fifth Circuit's inability to rein in, you [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  know, sort of avant-garde federal district judges and their orders has been part of what [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=359.98s)]
*  essentially, you know, allowed for these kind of nationwide injunctions to happen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=366.16s)]
*  It has definitely contributed to that mood. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  Nationwide injunctions have been a thing on both sides of the political aisle. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  But the way that they're being used here in connection with judge shopping is particularly [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  pernicious. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to be curious to see what the Fifth Circuit does with this, and I think [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  it's headed right for the Supreme Court, actually. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  We'll see what they make of it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=393.48s)]
*  Joyce Vance, thank you very much. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_lSqf2LVc&t=394.72s)]
