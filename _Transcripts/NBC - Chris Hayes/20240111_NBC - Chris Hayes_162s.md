# U.S., U.K. strikes Yemen with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Netherlands
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU)
*  Tonight, U.S. officials tell NBC News that American and British warships have launched [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=0.0s)]
*  strikes against multiple Houthi rebel targets inside Yemen after both navies fought off [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=4.62s)]
*  a barrage of more than 20 drones and missiles fired by the Iran-backed militant group earlier [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=10.0s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  These strikes come following increasing attacks by Houthis. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=16.2s)]
*  It started in mid-November in protest, Houthis say, of Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=19.36s)]
*  The group launched drone and missile strikes from Yemen on container ships transiting to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  the Red Sea headed for the Suez Canal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=28.64s)]
*  The attacks have severely hindered container traffic through the Red Sea. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  Eighty percent of container ships on the Suez Route diverted around the Cape of Good Hope, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  South Africa, according to industry publications. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  That adds 10 days and thousands of miles to their trips. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=43.2s)]
*  Right now, global shipping is existing as if the Suez Canal doesn't really work, straining [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  a still-recovering world economy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=50.78s)]
*  Gabe Gutierrez is the NBC News senior White House correspondent, and he joins me now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=53.52s)]
*  Gabe, what do we know? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=57.76s)]
*  Hi there, Chris. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=58.76s)]
*  Well, as you said, the stakes are incredibly high here around the world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=60.24s)]
*  President Biden just releasing a statement saying that more than 2,000 ships so far have [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=64.44s)]
*  been forced to divert from the Red Sea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=69.44s)]
*  And we're just getting that video in of one of these airstrikes tonight. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=71.36s)]
*  And we're also hearing, Chris, from senior administration officials. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=74.84s)]
*  They are saying that these strikes, the intent was not to escalate the situation, it was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=78.32s)]
*  to degrade the capability of the Houthis to attack maritime vessels. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=83.84s)]
*  But, Chris, as you know, escalation could be a very big concern here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=88.92s)]
*  We have not yet heard from Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=93.72s)]
*  Iran's response to all this, but we have already heard from the Houthis who are promising payback. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=95.92s)]
*  So the White House trying to contain this conflict, preventing it from being a wider [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=101.04s)]
*  war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  We don't have any indication on if there were any injuries in the strikes tonight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  But again, the president with a very forceful statement and saying at the very end of it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=110.62s)]
*  that the U.S. will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=115.34s)]
*  the free flow of international commerce. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=120.54s)]
*  So once again, President Biden saying that there could be further actions here by the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  U.S. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  And, Chris, this is something that we have been hearing now for weeks, repeated warnings [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=128.74s)]
*  to the Houthis to stop their attacks on those vessels in the Red Sea. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  Apparently those warnings did not work. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=136.86s)]
*  And so tonight, the Biden administration striking back. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_NAqi8CSU&t=138.9s)]
