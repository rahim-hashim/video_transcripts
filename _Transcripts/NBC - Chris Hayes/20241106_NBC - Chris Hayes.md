# ‘We must protect our core’ Civil rights lawyer reacts to Trump win
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0)
*  Because this will be Trump's second go-around in the White House, one of the things we might profitably look to when trying to make the kinds of strategic decisions Chris is talking about here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=0.0s)]
*  when trying to mount effective opposition, when trying not to concede in advance that he'll get away with things because he wants them, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=11.68s)]
*  one of the things we might profitably look to is the roster of people who made tracks and who made a mark countering him the first time around. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Among them is our next guest, Sherrilyn Ifill, founding director of Howard University's 14th Amendment Center for Law and Democracy, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  former president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=33.68s)]
*  Sherrilyn Ifill joins us now here. Sherrilyn, it's really nice to have you here. Thank you for coming in. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=37.8s)]
*  I wish it were under different circumstances, but glad to be here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=42.28s)]
*  Me too, but given the circumstances, you're one of the people I most want to talk to. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=45.08s)]
*  Let me just first ask you to respond to some of what you've been hearing around this table, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  some of what you just heard from Chris and what we've been talking about in the last hour, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=52.08s)]
*  and ask if you think we're getting any of this the wrong way around or if you really see any of this fundamentally differently. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=55.48s)]
*  You know, I agree with much of what you all have said. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=60.64s)]
*  The only piece that I think is missing is what I think is essential for us to figure out how to manage this period, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  which is we have to engage in a forensic examination of how we got here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=70.68s)]
*  And that forensic examination compels us to confront issues that we, progressive people, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=78.36s)]
*  and also just people who support democracy, have not sufficiently dealt with and confronted. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, you know, for me, one of them is ongoing racism and white supremacy, which is such a part of this country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  And it has been kind of the gateway drug. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=99.24s)]
*  Trump couldn't have come to power without it, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=102.48s)]
*  without making appeals to our ongoing flirtation, encounter, embrace of racism and white supremacist ideology. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=106.36s)]
*  And every time he wasn't stopped, every time we treat this as though it is not a deal breaker for leadership in this country, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=115.64s)]
*  we open up the door to the danger that Trump has represented. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=121.92s)]
*  When Trump said that Judge Manuel Curiel could not vote and be impartial because he was Mexican, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  there was no response, for example, from our United States Supreme Court. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=132.96s)]
*  But everyone lauded the Supreme Court when Chief Justice Roberts said there's no such thing as Obama judges and Trump judges. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=136.68s)]
*  But why didn't he say there's no such thing as Mexican judges on our federal courts? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=143.44s)]
*  And people just let that go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=147.84s)]
*  And we let Trump flirt with David Duke and flirt with the Proud Boys until we got to Charlottesville. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  And that was kind of a moment. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=155.2s)]
*  And then this campaign has been full filled with racist vitriol, filled with misogyny. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=156.96s)]
*  And none of those things have been deal breakers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=162.68s)]
*  I lay a lot of this at the feet of the press, not because Americans can't make up their own minds, but because the press is the curator. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=165.32s)]
*  This was to help us understand what makes sense and what doesn't make sense. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=172.6s)]
*  Not everyone is a nerdy political like you and me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=176.12s)]
*  And, you know, I've been watching conventions since 1972. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=179.12s)]
*  You know, everyone's not like that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=182.0s)]
*  We count on the media to sift it for us and tell us like this is out of the mainstream. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=183.72s)]
*  This is out of bounds. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=188.44s)]
*  And we didn't get enough of that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=190.0s)]
*  We got a lot of stenography and it didn't help people understand what was off the rails here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=191.28s)]
*  And so I think without that forensic, without understanding why Americans were vulnerable, I mean, Trump is truly a Bulgarian. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=197.68s)]
*  You know, everything about him is repulsive in the sense in which we think about people who make good politicians and simply saying he's appealing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=204.96s)]
*  And he's entertaining. Why were we so vulnerable to someone who basically runs a campaign as though it's a reality show? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=213.56s)]
*  And I don't think we've sufficiently examined ourselves to understand the places we are weak. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=222.24s)]
*  And the reason why I think it's important is because I believe we are weaker now than we were in 2016 or 2015. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=226.96s)]
*  Then we still had our sense of what the rules were. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=233.32s)]
*  We had some sense of norms and some sense of ethics. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=236.32s)]
*  I hate to use this word, but Trump has groomed us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=239.32s)]
*  He has allowed us to accept more and more things that are off the table to the point that we've actually shifted. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=241.96s)]
*  And I don't mean just the people who support him or the MAGA people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  We've all shifted because we've been compelled to accept things that would have been unacceptable. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  Does anyone remember when Trent Lott had to step down from being head Senate Majority Leader because he said that, you know, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=255.88s)]
*  maybe if Strum Thurman's way had been the way we would all be better off? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=262.72s)]
*  That was literally what he said. One sentence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=266.6s)]
*  And he had to step down. He understood. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=268.6s)]
*  He had to step down as Senate Majority Leader. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=270.2s)]
*  Does anybody think that would happen today? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=272.8s)]
*  We've moved the line ourselves. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=274.68s)]
*  And so we're not the same people, myself included, who are able to stop many of the things that Trump did in that first term, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=277.64s)]
*  because the line has moved in terms of what judges think is unacceptable, what people who would sit on juries think is unacceptable, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=285.8s)]
*  what that public popular opinion will be. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=292.84s)]
*  And if we don't recognize that, we will think that we have more strength than we have to counter him in the way that we need to. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, we can maybe get started on talking about the rule of law also, which we all like to say held the line. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=302.8s)]
*  But mostly it failed. So we have to really take stock. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=310.48s)]
*  We only have a very little bit of time to take stock of what we got wrong and where we went off the rails and try to create some guardrails [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=314.8s)]
*  for ourselves to understand that and begin to reeducate ourselves and American institutions, the media business, the press, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=324.6s)]
*  faith institutions, all of whom have allowed their moral compass to be set by by Donald Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=333.48s)]
*  So this is a dangerous time. How do we get that compass pointing back to North? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=342.88s)]
*  How do you think we do reset? I mean, understanding that we've let ourselves, as you say, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  be shifted to no longer be shocked by things that would have shocked us even a short number of years ago. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=352.44s)]
*  I mean, it's a very compelling case to make. But what do you imagine would be literally the mechanism by which we reset our sense of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=356.96s)]
*  propriety, our sense of what's appropriate in this country and our expectations in terms of norms and the rule of law? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=366.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm writing about this in my book, Is This America? But I've already begun doing some of this work. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  And I will say one thing I'm heartened about is my own profession. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=376.96s)]
*  I have been railing about the legal profession and how we allowed ourselves to experience these excesses. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=380.12s)]
*  And we have seen our profession. You saw you talked about the letter from various bar associations this week that went out [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=386.08s)]
*  talking about what the job of lawyers should be in a contested election. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  I sit on a task force on the American Bar Association co-chaired by former Homeland Security Secretary Jay Johnson and by Michael Ludig, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=396.16s)]
*  a task force on democracy that has been talking about lawyers and what we should do, what it means to take an oath. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=403.68s)]
*  Who are we as officers of the court? So we are there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  There are pockets that are trying to reset us. And my belief is that particularly in different fields, it's important that you do it yourself. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=412.72s)]
*  The media should be able to do it themselves. And every time we push at the media, they get very defensive. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=420.24s)]
*  The media itself, I think I don't want to impose on you anymore that I'd want you imposing it on my profession. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=426.04s)]
*  I think the media should be able to sit itself and engage in this forensic. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  I've been talking with faith leaders and participated in a conference called the Test of Faith. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=435.44s)]
*  Where have you been? You know, faith institutions are democratic institutions. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  But when you have leaders standing up saying we're white Christian nationalists, where are all the other Christians? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=444.4s)]
*  Where's my church? Where's the black church? Where's the why are people saying that's not a thing, you know, and saying it strongly and saying that is contrary to my faith. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=449.0s)]
*  So my hope is that within our own separate institutions, the institutions that undergird healthy democracies, we can begin to have these conversations ourselves so that we will be strong and equipped and ready. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=457.56s)]
*  Otherwise, we're just all over the place and he will set us even further down the road. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=471.88s)]
*  Not only does it make those institutions weak to not have that self-awareness and that appreciation, but it also takes us off the table in terms of us standing up for the country. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=475.8s)]
*  Sherrilyn Eiffel, every time I talk to you, I get smarter. I really appreciate you being here with us today. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=484.92s)]
*  I want to read you guys a little bit of what Sherrilyn wrote today in her newsletter, her sub-stack newsletter. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=491.0s)]
*  She lists five things. Forgive me. Read this in your voice that she believes people should prioritize now. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=495.44s)]
*  This is item number four that she says, quote, Our spirits will be assaulted in the coming months by coarse and crude language, by open displays of violence, of privilege and of unchecked power. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=500.56s)]
*  We may feel as if we are occupied by a hostile force. This feeling will combine with our grief to weaken and exhaust us. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=512.04s)]
*  We must hold on to the things that refresh our spirits. Time with family, music, art, nature, hobbies, food. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=518.56s)]
*  We must protect our core. I will say, having lived through the first time America elected Donald Trump and having lived past this last few hours, boy, does that resonate for me. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=526.24s)]
*  Sherrilyn, I thank you for reminding us, among other things, to take care of ourselves. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=537.16s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2D_URmySg0&t=540.5999999999999s)]
