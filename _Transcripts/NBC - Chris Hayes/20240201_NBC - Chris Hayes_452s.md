# MAGA-run state GOPs face civil wars, bribery scandals, money woes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, we got some news today that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=0.0s)]
*  confirms something that we kind of knew already, which is the Republican Party [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=3.5s)]
*  doesn't really exist anymore as an institution. It has essentially been [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=6.92s)]
*  cannibalized by Donald Trump, subsumed into MAGA, with profound implications [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=11.92s)]
*  both for Republicans and for the American democratic system as a whole. You [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=17.56s)]
*  can see the evidence of this everywhere you look, like a new revelation that the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=22.14s)]
*  Republican National Committee's anemic fundraising has left it with a paltry [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=26.58s)]
*  eight million dollars on hand. Not exactly the war chest a major political [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=31.06s)]
*  party needs in an election year, especially considering Democrats have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=35.66s)]
*  nearly three times as much in their coffers. Speaking to Puck, one RNC member [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=38.82s)]
*  offered this blunt assessment, quote, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=43.18s)]
*  Puck also reports Trump world is rather unhappy with the state of affairs at the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=51.22s)]
*  RNC and they are looking to install a MAGA loyalist at the top, something Steve [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=55.14s)]
*  Bannon openly advocated for earlier this week when he called for the ouster of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=59.22s)]
*  party chair Ronna Romney McDaniel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=63.5s)]
*  Why is Ronna McDaniel and that team over there? They don't want to do it because [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=67.34s)]
*  they understand they're culpable. What in the hell was RNC doing? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  They're guilty of a mortal sin against this republic, and that sin is not going [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=76.64s)]
*  to go away until she is removed as the chairman of the RNC. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=82.18s)]
*  I'm tired of the happy talk and we're going to, you know why she's got to take [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=97.18s)]
*  out a line of credit because you cut her off, right? The war room, I said, not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  another penny, not another 25 bucks or 50 bucks a month, not one cent until [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=106.34s)]
*  they're gone. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=111.9s)]
*  OK, now let's just be clear here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=113.86s)]
*  The idea that Steve Bannon, two-shirt is strategic genius, is solely responsible [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  for the pitiful fundraisers in the committee is laughable. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=120.7s)]
*  That's not it. But it does remain true. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=123.18s)]
*  The MAGA movement has had it with the RNC, which is ironic for a number of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=125.42s)]
*  reasons. First of all, because RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel is so [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=128.62s)]
*  unabashedly pro-MAGA, she tried to pressure Nikki Haley, Trump's only credible [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  remaining opponent in Republican primary, to drop out, only for Trump to then [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  stab McDaniel in the back so he could play benevolent dictator and say that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=141.06s)]
*  Haley should stay in the race. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=144.82s)]
*  It's also ironic because Trump, of all people, is partially responsible for the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=146.78s)]
*  RNC's financial rose because his super PACs are hoovering up all of the small [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=151.22s)]
*  dollar donations so he can use them to pay his tens of millions of dollars in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=156.7s)]
*  legal bills. And to be clear, it is always the case to some extent, the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=161.82s)]
*  presidential candidate and their movement controls the purse strings of their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=165.7s)]
*  respective parties during the election year. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=168.58s)]
*  But Trump is just on another level as he subsumes the Republican Party into his [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  own party of one. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=175.38000000000002s)]
*  And you can see the trickle down effects of this all over the country as the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=176.46s)]
*  Republican Party, as a party, destroys itself like a snake eating its own tail. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=179.78s)]
*  A lot of the problems that becomes Trump himself is a conspiracy obsessed maniac [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=184.9s)]
*  who cultivates the most deranged characteristics in his diehard policies. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=189.78s)]
*  In Michigan, the state Republican Party voted to fire its head, Christina Caramo, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=195.22s)]
*  earlier this month and replace her with Pete Hoekstra, a former Republican [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=200.02s)]
*  congressman and Trump ambassador to the Netherlands. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=203.86s)]
*  If you're a regular watcher of this program, you might remember Caramo. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=206.74s)]
*  She's the election denying conspiracy theorist who ran to be Michigan's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=209.94s)]
*  secretary of state in 2022. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=213.54s)]
*  Having intimate relationships with people who are demonically possessed or [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=216.58s)]
*  oppressed, I strongly believe that a person opens themselves up to possession. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=219.7s)]
*  Demonic possession is real. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=224.5s)]
*  How people become possessed, I don't know all the details of it, but I was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=226.86s)]
*  surmised that the sexual licentiousness in our culture is a lot of spiritual [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=230.38s)]
*  things that go on wrong. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=235.94s)]
*  So she didn't win that race in 2022, thankfully, and you can see why [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=238.38s)]
*  Michigan Republicans have decided they don't want Caramo running the show [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=242.18s)]
*  anymore. Here's the thing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=245.1s)]
*  She's refusing to step down and it's now splitting its party in half. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=246.86s)]
*  In fact, the RNC held a big meeting today with representatives from across the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=250.98s)]
*  nation and Michigan Republicans did not have a seat at the table because Caramo [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  refuses to step down and hand the reins to Hoekstra. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=259.26s)]
*  In fact, both of them showed up today, each claiming they are in charge of the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=262.78s)]
*  Michigan Republican Party and neither one was officially recognized by the RNC. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=266.82s)]
*  Now, factional weirdness happens in politics all the time, these kind of party [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=271.26s)]
*  fights. So if this was a one-off, you could say, yeah, but it's not just [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=275.34s)]
*  Michigan. This is like, this is a trend. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=278.7s)]
*  OK, in Arizona, you've got the failed MAGA gubernatorial candidate, Carrie Lake, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  who is now involved in a convoluted feud that has pushed out that state's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=286.22s)]
*  Republican chairman, Jeff DeWitt. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=289.94s)]
*  Depending on who you ask, DeWitt either tried to bribe Lake to stay out of the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=292.06s)]
*  upcoming Senate race or he was the victim of an elaborate scheme from Lake to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=295.74s)]
*  oust him from his position so that she can claim total control of the state [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=300.14s)]
*  party. Now, there's a new head of the Arizona Republican Party, a so-called [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=303.62s)]
*  election integrity activist who worked on Trump's 2020 campaign. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=308.5s)]
*  Although her election, a party chair, wasn't all smooth sailing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=313.26s)]
*  As The New York Times reports, get this quote, the vote was delayed by a lengthy [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=316.06s)]
*  debate over a motion to ban the use of electronic tabulators, mistrusted by many [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=321.06s)]
*  election deniers in the party to count the ballots. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=326.54s)]
*  But we're not done. Meanwhile, in Nevada, where the Republican Party is run by a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=330.66s)]
*  guy who was literally criminally indicted for his role in Trump's fake [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=334.3s)]
*  elector scheme, the state is holding both a Republican primary and a caucus next [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=338.18s)]
*  week because of some complicated infighting. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=342.7s)]
*  Nikki Haley would be on the primary ballot while Donald Trump will be [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=346.74s)]
*  competing in the caucus. Now, the caucus is the one actually awarding delegates, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  which means the whole contest is basically rigged in his favor, which is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=353.82s)]
*  the whole point of them concocting this entire enterprise. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=357.42s)]
*  Also, another irony, of course, because if the situation was reversed, Trump would [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=360.98s)]
*  be railing to anyone and everyone about how the contest is being stolen from him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=365.98s)]
*  And this is what you got to understand. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=370.34s)]
*  When he calls things rigged, that is an aspiration. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=371.78s)]
*  It's not moral condemnation. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=376.54s)]
*  He wants things to be rigged in his favor. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=378.02s)]
*  That is his model. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=380.1s)]
*  He thinks everything is rigged and should be rigged in his favor. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=381.18s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure, to be fair, he would win a fully fair, unrigged Republican [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=384.7s)]
*  primary. That said, it's hard to disentangle the current mess the party finds [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=389.42s)]
*  itself in from Trump and his movement's obvious power grab. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=392.86s)]
*  The complete control the MAGA movement has over the entirety of the party [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=396.82s)]
*  apparatus. And again, this isn't just some like backroom politics of the RNC [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=400.7s)]
*  and the Republican Party. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's vision for the entire country to bend the fabric of reality [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  and the American experiment and its political system to his whims. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=416.14s)]
*  The current broken state of the Republican Party, you see, which is now run by [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=420.38s)]
*  cranks whose only qualification is they're filthy to him, is his vision for the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=424.5s)]
*  whole U.S. government. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz6AoEcW0Ok&t=429.66s)]
