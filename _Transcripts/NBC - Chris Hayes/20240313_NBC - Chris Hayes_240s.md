# Trump campaign asks Are you better off now than you were four years ago?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk)
*  As we reported here, Donald Trump and Joe Biden became the presumptive nominees of their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=0.0s)]
*  parties for president last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=5.3s)]
*  As I've said many times, they both have records to run on, which I guess is why Trump allies [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=7.24s)]
*  keep asking this question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=12.3s)]
*  And people look around and they say, am I better off now than I was four years ago? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=15.64s)]
*  The answer to that is no. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=19.94s)]
*  You can compare very easily how much better your life was with Donald Trump in office [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=21.54s)]
*  and how much worse you are now that Joe Biden is in office. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=26.74s)]
*  They just keep trying to squeeze out a little more juice from that old Ronald Reagan campaign [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=30.74s)]
*  slogan, hoping that we've all wiped 2020 from our minds completely. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=34.9s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=38.98s)]
*  It is a good question. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=39.98s)]
*  And if Republicans are going to keep asking it, I think we should keep trying to answer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=40.98s)]
*  it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=44.66s)]
*  So how good was your life four years ago today on March 13th, 2020? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=45.66s)]
*  On that day, Donald Trump held a 72 minute long press conference in the Rose Garden [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=53.22s)]
*  to address the coronavirus. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=57.98s)]
*  And so I want to show you what that press conference looked like in relation to the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=60.04s)]
*  actual facts of what was being reported on that very day. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=64.26s)]
*  Breaking news tonight, President Trump declaring the coronavirus a national emergency, a national [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=69.5s)]
*  emergency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  Two very big words. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  The number of cases in the U.S. rising to near 2000, at least 41 deaths, all schools [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=78.46s)]
*  closing in a growing number of states, millions of students impacted, houses of worship, spending [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=83.97999999999999s)]
*  services, landmarks, theme parks, sporting events and concerts shutting down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=89.94s)]
*  We don't want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn't be doing it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=94.96s)]
*  1.4 million tests on board next week and 5 million within a month, I doubt we'll need [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  The testing crisis drive through stations overflowing, President Trump vowing to boost [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=108.74s)]
*  testing and saying he takes no responsibility for widespread delays. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=114.1s)]
*  Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was in fact a failing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=118.3s)]
*  Do you take responsibility for that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=123.61999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't take responsibility at all. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  The chaos at grocery store lines where they stretch out the door, shelves cleared out. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=127.66s)]
*  At this New York grocery store, customers stood for two hours to check out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  Isles usually chock full of toilet paper, paper towels, cold medicine, even pasta, now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=138.06s)]
*  lay bare with nothing left. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=142.86s)]
*  It showed up today and it's just chaos. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=144.86s)]
*  These guys are selling a lot of toilet paper. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=146.78s)]
*  I don't know, there seems to be some guidance that toilet paper is not an effective protection [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=148.06s)]
*  against getting the coronavirus. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=152.94s)]
*  Hospitals bracing for a possible surge in patients already reporting shortages of masks [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=154.94s)]
*  and protective clothing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=159.94s)]
*  Will there be enough beds? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=161.62s)]
*  You said that you don't take responsibility, but you did disband the White House pandemic [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=163.3s)]
*  office. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  Officials that worked in that office said that you, that the White House lost valuable [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  time because that office wasn't disbanded. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=174.58s)]
*  Well, I just think it's a nasty question. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=175.58s)]
*  Some of the doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through, in interesting terms, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=177.86s)]
*  and very accurate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=185.02s)]
*  I think you're going to find in a number of weeks it's going to be a very accurate term. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=186.46s)]
*  Nervous, scared, confused, not really sure what's going on. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=189.78s)]
*  Or worse, could get worse. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=195.58s)]
*  That, just to be clear, that all happened on the same day. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=197.78s)]
*  We didn't like stitch together a week of footage. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=204.62s)]
*  That was March 13th, 2020. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=207.06s)]
*  One day. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=209.66s)]
*  So how about it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=211.26s)]
*  You better off than you were four years ago? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=212.26s)]
*  Exactly four years ago? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=215.26s)]
*  I'll leave that for you to decide. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDjFfVOjQYk&t=217.54s)]
