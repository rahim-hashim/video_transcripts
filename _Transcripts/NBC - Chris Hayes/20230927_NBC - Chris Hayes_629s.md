Video Description: "The garbage about the military being 'too woke’ is mostly a smokescreen to hide their disdain for the fact that in their view the upper echelons of the U.S. armed forces were insufficiently loyal to Trump's coup," says Chris Hayes on the military's “original sin” according to MAGA Republicans.

# Milley on Trump suggesting ‘execution’: Threat to me is threat to entire military
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight there's going to be another Republican primary debate featuring a bunch of candidates not named Donald Trump [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=2.0s)]
*  polling in a distant second and lower. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And what will likely be laid bare on that, Steve, even without Trump present, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=9.6s)]
*  is the extent to which what used to be bog standard Republican issues [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=13.6s)]
*  have been cast aside to serve the whims of the ex-president who isn't there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=17.6s)]
*  As someone who's covered politics professionally for several decades, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=22.6s)]
*  particularly as someone who lived through 9-11 and the run of the Iraq War, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=25.6s)]
*  I've got to say the Republican Party's war on the Pentagon and U.S. armed forces [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  is pretty shocking, pretty head spinning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=35.2s)]
*  It starts with Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=38.2s)]
*  The former football coach has spent months blocking Congress from filling hundreds of vacancies in the Pentagon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=42.2s)]
*  It's part of a long shot attempt to get the U.S. military to make it harder for service members to get access to an abortion. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=49.2s)]
*  Now, Congress can circumvent Tuberville's blockade, which is procedural and mired in Senate procedure, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=56.2s)]
*  but to go around the blockade is a time-consuming process. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=62.2s)]
*  So last Wednesday, the Senate did take the time to confirm Air Force General Charles Q. Brown Jr. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=66.2s)]
*  as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the nation's top military officer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=73.2s)]
*  Now, General Brown was very well regarded. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=78.2s)]
*  He was confirmed on a broadly bipartisan basis, 83 to 11. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=81.2s)]
*  All 11 no votes came from Republicans, one of whom was Tommy Tuberville. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=87.2s)]
*  And when pressed on his no vote, Tuberville had this to say about General Brown. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=92.2s)]
*  I heard some things that he talked about, about race and things that he wanted to mix into the military. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=97.2s)]
*  Let me tell you something. Our military is not an equal opportunity employer. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=104.2s)]
*  We're looking for the best of best to do whatever. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=108.2s)]
*  We're not looking for different groups, social justice groups. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=111.2s)]
*  We don't want to single-handedly destroy our military from within. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=116.2s)]
*  He talked about race and things he wanted to mix into the military, mixing in the military, race. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=120.2s)]
*  We're looking the best of the best. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=127.2s)]
*  We're not looking, we don't want to single-handedly destroy our military from within. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=129.2s)]
*  Now, for many reasons, I think that's a gross and racist thing to say about a man who will be the second black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=134.2s)]
*  It's also just on its face factually untrue. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=142.2s)]
*  The Department of Defense literally is an equal opportunity employer. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=144.2s)]
*  In fact, the DOD has an office of equal employment opportunity under the Inspector General and an office of diversity, equity, and inclusion, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=148.2s)]
*  focusing on, quote, equal opportunity policies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=156.2s)]
*  Today, one day after that interview, the MAGA Republican House voted to cut the salary of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who is also black, to $1. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=160.2s)]
*  This initiative was pushed by none other than Marjorie Taylor Greene, who accused Lloyd of jeopardizing national security, presumably by being too woke. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=171.2s)]
*  And if Greene wants to play this rhetorical game, wouldn't the party blocking top military appointments be the one jeopardizing national security? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=180.2s)]
*  There's a lot to say about this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=187.2s)]
*  I will just note, again, as someone who's covered politics for two decades, particularly the wake of 9-11 run-up to Iraq War, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=190.2s)]
*  that it goes without saying, if a Democrat tried something like this, Republicans would be calling for them to be tried for treason. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=196.2s)]
*  And that's not hyperbole, which I'll get to in a second. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=202.2s)]
*  Now, not to be outdone, Lauren Boebert, who has a kind of feud, I guess, with Marjorie Taylor Greene, they're in a kind of competition, she pulled the stunt of her own today. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=205.2s)]
*  What she did was propose the house cut the salary of another Pentagon official, Sean Skelly, explicitly because Skelly is trans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=214.2s)]
*  I rise today to offer my amendment that utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary of Sean Kelly, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=222.2s)]
*  That salary shall be reduced to $1. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=233.2s)]
*  This delusional man thinking he is a woman embodies and espouses the woke-ism that's causing significant harm to our military readiness and troop morale. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=236.2s)]
*  Setting aside how gross it is to purposefully misgender someone in that way, Boebert's objection here is the identity of the person, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=251.2s)]
*  Imagine if Boebert tried this stunt with any other identity. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=261.2s)]
*  She said we need to effectively stop paying a government employee or bust them down to a dollar a year because they're Greek or they're Latino or they're Jewish or they're black. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=264.2s)]
*  It's just an outright bit of rank bigotry directed at a service member from the well of the house, live on camera. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=275.2s)]
*  And what I've just given you a taste of is in the last 48 hours. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=282.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans are still careening us towards a government shutdown, which, by the way, is going to meet the troops will not get paid. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=288.2s)]
*  Now, that vote I mentioned a moment ago elevating General Brown to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is because the current chairman, as you may have seen, General Mark Milley, is leaving his post when his term expires next month. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=295.2s)]
*  Milley, of course, was first appointed by then President Trump, who has since soured on him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=308.2s)]
*  And over the weekend, Trump effectively said that Milley should be executed for treason. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=313.2s)]
*  That's not I'm not making that up. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=319.2s)]
*  That's not an exaggeration. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=321.2s)]
*  That's what he suggested. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=322.2s)]
*  Over some spurious allegations, Milley spoke to Chinese leaders about Trump's mental fitness. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=324.2s)]
*  Now, what Milley actually did was reach out to his Chinese counterpart under the direction of the secretary of defense, which is civilian, to make sure that Donald Trump's desperate coup attempts and erratic lashing out didn't lead to a war with nuclear armed China. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=329.2s)]
*  And thank God he did that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=342.2s)]
*  In a new interview out today, Chairman Milley addressed those threats from the president. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=344.2s)]
*  President Trump recently said that your dealings with China were so egregious that in times gone by, the punishment would have been death. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=349.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=359.2s)]
*  He said that as much as these comments directed at me, it's also directed at the institution of the military. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=364.2s)]
*  And there's 2.1 million of us in uniform. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=369.2s)]
*  And the American people can take it to the bank that all of us, every single one of us, from private to general, we're loyal to that constitution and we'll never turn our back on it no matter what. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=373.2s)]
*  No matter what the threats, no matter what the humiliation, no matter what. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=381.2s)]
*  If we're willing to die for that document, if we're willing to deploy to combat, if we're willing to lose an arm, a leg, an eye to protect and support and defend that document and protect the American people, then we're willing to live for it, too. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=385.2s)]
*  So I'm not going to comment directly on those things, but I can tell you that this military, this soldier, me, will never turn our back on that constitution. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=398.2s)]
*  Now Milley has become a villain in MAGA world for rider reasons. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=407.2s)]
*  One of them is that they see him as insufficiently bigoted against LGBTQ members of the armed forces. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=411.2s)]
*  That's a subtext that Republican Congressman Paul Gosar made explicit when he wrote in his weekly newsletter, quote, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=417.2s)]
*  I bet you you hadn't heard that until now, most of you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=423.2s)]
*  Yes, he meant hanged. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=437.2s)]
*  The context of that statement where Gosar called for the execution of the highest ranking military officer in the country, comparing him to a Nazi collaborator, a Quisling, was about, of course, January 6th. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=439.2s)]
*  And here I think we kind of unlock the mystery. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=450.2s)]
*  Like what on earth is going on? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=453.2s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=455.2s)]
*  Why are Republicans waging war against the military, the top brass? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=457.2s)]
*  January 6th, more than anything else, that is the original sin of the military's top brass for MAGA Republicans. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=463.2s)]
*  And I believe all the bigotry is sincere, definitely part of the right wing meltdown. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=471.2s)]
*  The origin of this sustained assault, particularly on the top brass, this garbage about the military being too woke, is mostly a smokescreen to hide their disdain for the fact that in their view, the upper echelons of the US armed forces were insufficiently loyal to Trump's coup. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=476.2s)]
*  I mean, that's really what it comes down to, right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=496.2s)]
*  Leaders of the armed forces of these United States, the ones who take an oath to protect and defend the US Constitution, upheld that oath and took that oath seriously at a dire moment, at one of the most dire moments since the Civil War. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=500.2s)]
*  And they refuse to be the arm tip of the spear for Trump's attempt to end that constitutional republic. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=516.2s)]
*  That is their sin. That is their crime. That is why they are now the enemy of this MAGA faction. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=523.2s)]
*  Ergo, the military is woke. Ergo, the military is the deep state. Ergo, Republicans are waging war on the military. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=530.2s)]
*  And all of their leaders who are not entirely the tank for Trump's war on democracy, those who can't be trusted to be loyal, they must be purged. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=538.2s)]
*  And to be clear, this is not just speculation. It's what Trump is saying out loud, promising that he is going to do. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=547.2s)]
*  Here's my plan to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our democracy from Washington corruption once and for all. And corruption it is. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=556.2s)]
*  First, I will immediately reissue my 2020 executive order restoring the president's authority to remove rogue bureaucrats. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=565.2s)]
*  And I will wield that power very aggressively. Second, we will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=574.2s)]
*  And there are plenty of them. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=584.2s)]
*  He is saying, I will purge the security forces of the United States of those who are not loyal to me and my authoritarian aspirations. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=586.2s)]
*  He's saying it plain as day. He's promising it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=595.2s)]
*  The question in front of American voters is, do you want to give Trump the chance to purge the military so he can finish the job he started on January 6th? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=600.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYLT_w_Dd2A&t=616.2s)]
