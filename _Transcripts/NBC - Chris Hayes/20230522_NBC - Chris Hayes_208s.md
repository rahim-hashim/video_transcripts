Video Description: “The fact that he has repeated the liable after being found to have sexually abused her and liabled her—it’s outrageous, and it’s supportive of punitive damages. This verdict could be greater than the $5 million that she got in the first case,” says George Conway.

# E. Jean Carroll seeks new damages from Trump after CNN comments
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M)
*  And, as if things could not get any worse for Trump legally, he's now facing new trouble [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=0.0s)]
*  for comments he made about writer E. Jean Carroll on national television just one day [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=5.48s)]
*  after being found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in order to pay $5 million [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=10.1s)]
*  in damages. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=15.64s)]
*  Tonight, Ms. Carroll is seeking in Manhattan federal court a quote, very substantial additional [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=16.64s)]
*  amount of damages in response to Donald Trump's comments on CNN. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=21.88s)]
*  The filing says tonight that she should be awarded these damages to quote, punish Trump, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=26.52s)]
*  to deter him from engaging in further defamation and to deter others from doing the same. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=30.96s)]
*  George Conway is a conservative attorney and former Republican. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=36.28s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=39.2s)]
*  George, let me start on the E. Jean Carroll news. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=40.2s)]
*  I know you had talked to her at some point about the case. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=43.04s)]
*  You were invoked in closing arguments as a sort of boogeyman that was behind the whole [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=46.16s)]
*  thing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=50.72s)]
*  It seemed eminently predictable that CNN was going to be hosting defamation when they had [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=52.22s)]
*  him on the day after this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=57.58s)]
*  He then proceeded to say things about her that are very similar to what he said that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=59.48s)]
*  got him found guilty of defamation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=64.56s)]
*  Do you think this is a strong case and what's it mean? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=68.84s)]
*  Well, I think she has a strong case for adding those punitive damages claims to her prior [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=71.1s)]
*  complaint. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=77.74s)]
*  The original complaint that she's amending this time was actually the original complaint [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  from the first lawsuit that Jean brought in 2019 when President Trump, as president, from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=84.02s)]
*  the bully pulpit of the Oval Office, denied that anything ever happened at Bergdorf-Gordman [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  and basically accused Jean of being a liar. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=98.41999999999999s)]
*  She got $3 million for the second libel that occurred in 2022 when he was dumb enough to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=104.08s)]
*  repeat the first libel and this time he wasn't president so he didn't have this legal argument [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=111.12s)]
*  because that's why the first case went off on a wild goose chase in the appellate courts. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=116.2s)]
*  Now it's come back. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=120.92s)]
*  That case already had more damages potentially than the case that she already won, than the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  $3 million she already won because he was president at the time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  It was the first, the very, very first libel that he made on Jean Carroll. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=133.04s)]
*  And now the fact that he has repeated the libel after being found to have sexually abused [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=141.6s)]
*  her and libeled her is really, really outrageous and it's supportive of punitive damages. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=149.2s)]
*  This verdict could be greater than the $5 million that she got in the first case. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=157.52s)]
*  Frankly, I hope it is because I think at some point he's got to stop lying about this and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=163.12s)]
*  stop libeling her. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, how many times are we going to have to go through this? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=170.4s)]
*  Well, this is interesting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  Trump's attorney's response is, Ms. Carroll's 11th hour attempt to amend her complaint exposes [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  the true motivation behind her numerous lawsuits and it's like, yes, the true motivation is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=179.08s)]
*  to get him to stop defaming her. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=182.62s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxMahsMbV6M&t=184.6s)]
