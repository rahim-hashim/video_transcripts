# New poll Most Americans think Trump trial should occur before election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls)
*  It was just one month ago that Donald Trump was indicted on 37 counts related to his handling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=0.0s)]
*  of classified materials. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=5.12s)]
*  Trump's Mar-a-Lago judge, Aileen Cannon, set the trial date for August 14th and everyone [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=7.08s)]
*  sort of knew that that is not going to hold. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=10.94s)]
*  It's almost certainly going to change in the coming weeks. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=13.48s)]
*  Then Special Counsel Jack Smith's office filed to hold the trial as early as December. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  And we've yet to see how long Trump and his lawyers plan to drag out the process, but [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=21.66s)]
*  what they'll come back with. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  But a new poll from Political Magazine and Ipsos is giving us some fascinating insight [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=27.2s)]
*  into how voters are thinking about this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=30.96s)]
*  It found that a clear majority of Americans, 62%, think the trial should happen before [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=33.48s)]
*  the 2024 election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Take a look at when we break that out by political affiliation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=40.76s)]
*  You see that red column on the left side of your screen, almost half of Republicans, in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=44.08s)]
*  fact a plurality of them, agree the trial should happen quickly, only a little more [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=49.8s)]
*  than a third disagree. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=55.04s)]
*  Or on the right side on your screen, roughly the same number of independents think the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=56.8s)]
*  trial should happen before the election. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  And when asked about Trump's guilt, almost half of all Americans said they believe he [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  is guilty of the charges, less than a third do not think he's guilty. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=66.52s)]
*  And again, breaking that down by party gives us a pretty interesting picture. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=70.52s)]
*  Unsurprisingly, an overwhelming majority of Democrats believe he's guilty. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=74.16s)]
*  But again, look at that red column. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  A full quarter of Republicans think Trump is guilty, which is interesting. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=80.12s)]
*  There's the very people he needs to win over to get the nomination. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=84.8s)]
*  Another 20% are unsure. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=87.84s)]
*  And look how many people at independence just don't know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=89.92s)]
*  That's the yellow column, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=93.56s)]
*  It's not a good sign for the ex-president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=94.56s)]
*  More than a third of independents think he's guilty. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=96.82s)]
*  A little less than half are just unsure and they could go either way. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=99.2s)]
*  Ankush Cardhuri is a former federal prosecutor. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=103.56s)]
*  He is now a contributing writer for Political Magazine, where he wrote about this new polling, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=106.52s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=110.44s)]
*  Ankush, I thought the logic of, I was surprised by the finding that 62% say yes, let's have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=112.64s)]
*  this trial before the election. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=118.72s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=121.04s)]
*  I was surprised by it too, and in particular, the fact that almost half of Republicans held [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=122.64s)]
*  that view, as you noted. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=128.04s)]
*  And what I draw from that is that Americans are taking this seriously and they want to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=129.88s)]
*  know the outcome of this proceeding before they potentially head to the polls and reelect [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=133.56s)]
*  this man. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=137.4s)]
*  And I have to say that the fact that people want this to move along quickly is somewhat [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=138.4s)]
*  surprising to me because it may be hard for the judge to accommodate that preference, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=143.12s)]
*  but it kind of, I thought, was somewhat reassuring that people are taking this seriously and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=147.16s)]
*  deciding to them, thinking to themselves, well, this is information that I would like [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  to have before I consider whether or not this man should be in office again. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=154.4s)]
*  Yes, I mean, it's the most obviously logical way to think about this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=157.8s)]
*  Like, okay, let's have a trial and see, like, did he do this thing? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=162.16s)]
*  Let's give him the process and have it out and have a conclusion about the man's, you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=165.36s)]
*  know, a felon or not before we decide to vote for him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  I also thought, one thing I thought too was, and people have said this all along, you know, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  if you're a Republican who thinks he's being railroaded and he's innocent, you want that, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=176.96s)]
*  you want his name cleared as soon as possible, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=182.68s)]
*  I mean, if you think the guy didn't do it and if you think that's only going to come [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  out of trial, like, there's an incentive to have it so that you can say, like, get, you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  know, I don't want this hanging over me when voters go to the polls. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=192.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  So there is an argument in favor of if you're that sort of voter, you hold that view that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=197.32s)]
*  you would want this to have happened before the election so it'll clear his name. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=201.88s)]
*  But I think that, you know, there were other numbers in the poll that suggest some sort [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=206.16s)]
*  of complications around the narrative that these indictments may actually be helping [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=210.64s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  I think these numbers don't actually back that up. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  And they suggest to me, you know, in fact, that the Republican respondents were a little [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=218.76s)]
*  bit more conflicted. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=223.0s)]
*  I mean, if you ran the numbers, it was basically a net nothing in terms of the effect that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=224.0s)]
*  the indictment had on Republicans' views. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=228.44s)]
*  Roughly a quarter, I think, said it made them more likely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  Roughly a quarter said less likely to support him. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=234.44s)]
*  And about a half said that they don't know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=236.0s)]
*  And you know, I know that Trump and many of his allies have been saying, oh, these indictments [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=238.2s)]
*  are like, you know, propelling him through the polls and boosting the fundraising numbers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=242.22s)]
*  But as you know, correlation is not causation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=246.38s)]
*  And a lot of other things have happened during this same period. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=248.74s)]
*  And I think these numbers suggest that it may not be the indictments that are affecting [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=251.14s)]
*  the trajectory of the GOP primary race at the moment. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cpXttp5ls&t=255.42s)]
