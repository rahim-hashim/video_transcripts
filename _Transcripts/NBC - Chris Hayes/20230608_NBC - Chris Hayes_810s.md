# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc)
*  George Conway is a conservative attorney and former Republican political operative. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=0.0s)]
*  Renato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor, legal affairs columnist for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=4.38s)]
*  Political Magazine. Both join me now. Renato, let me just start on you and sort of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=7.92s)]
*  your top line kind of takeaway from the stack of these developments. But the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=11.98s)]
*  informing Trump that he's a target, the meeting that happened, this act of grand [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=18.2s)]
*  jury which seems to be doing still the kind of investigatory work you would [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=23.04s)]
*  expect not the day before someone's indicted. What do you make of all of it [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=27.32s)]
*  together? So the bottom line is if a prosecutor tells you that you are the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  target of their investigation, it means they expect to indict you. When my [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=39.3s)]
*  clients now, when I was in the other side of the aisle, when I was a federal [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  prosecutor, that's when I told somebody that they were a target, that's what I [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=46.84s)]
*  meant. When I sent a target letter, it meant that an indictment was going to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=50.96s)]
*  follow. And if one of my clients did the target letter now, that's what I tell them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=54.4s)]
*  You need to prepare for an indictment, expect that that's going to happen, and we [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  actively start preparing for that to happen. So that's big news. And then [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=63.04s)]
*  regarding the fact that witnesses are coming in, what that tells me is it's not [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=67.72s)]
*  happening like tomorrow. I know there's a lot of smoking around that and maybe [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=71.4s)]
*  it'll happen, but generally speaking if witnesses are going before the grand [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=76.32s)]
*  jury this week, like in today, as one witness you mentioned is going in a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=80.68s)]
*  Trump spokesman, that suggests to me that an indictment is not happening [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  tomorrow. They're going to be absorbing that testimony, including that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=89.28s)]
*  in some of their paperwork, sending an indictment over to Merrick Garland for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=93.48s)]
*  his review. I would expect an indictment not to be happening in let's say a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  matter of a few days, but maybe next week, a week after, or even further from that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  as they make decisions regarding the scope of indictments at which [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=106.84s)]
*  venues to bring them. George, what are your thoughts? Yeah, I basically agree with that and I agree with [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=111.56s)]
*  your excellent summary of what's going on. I mean I think the word that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=118.28s)]
*  you could use here that was probably inadvisably used in the Georgia [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  investigation is that an indictment is imminent. I mean I think it's highly, I [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=126.76s)]
*  mean they're basically telling him they're likely to indict him, but it [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=131.2s)]
*  doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be tomorrow, doesn't necessarily mean [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=134.92s)]
*  that next week, I mean but it does mean that if you are a believer in the rule [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  of law and a hankering for the rule of law, the Santa's going to come early this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  year and it's not going to be in Christmas, it's going to be sooner rather [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=145.76s)]
*  than later. But you know we don't know, there's just rampant [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=148.88s)]
*  speculation that it could be tomorrow or the day after, or 11 o'clock tomorrow, or [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=152.2s)]
*  or next Thursday. But it's very just clear, given all the indications which [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=156.16s)]
*  you laid out nicely Chris, that you know we're at the end, we're reaching the end [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=161.8s)]
*  stages of the investigation. I mean the fact that so many leaks are coming out [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=166.36s)]
*  now is a function of the fact that so many people know what's going on, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=169.8s)]
*  everything except the timing, because the defense lawyers are all sharing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  information about witnesses who have gone into the grand jury or talked to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  the FBI and it's just a flood of information that's coming out and now I [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  guess in Trump world the word has gotten out that the target letter has been [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=185.52s)]
*  received and that's you know it's seeping out into the press. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=189.2s)]
*  This is the end stages of an investigation. I just want to stress what you said there [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=193.88s)]
*  because I think that's actually important because one of the weird [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=199.0s)]
*  things right is that is like the tempo of information so why are we learning [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=200.72s)]
*  so much and to your point there I think you're right about that, it's sort of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=204.32s)]
*  from my perspective as a journalist right? Yeah basically the more people that know [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=207.72s)]
*  something it's just yeah yeah a lot of people now know a lot about what's going [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=212.52s)]
*  on but not everything and there's a lot that we don't know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=221.0s)]
*  Rana go ahead. No I was just gonna say I don't know if Santa's bringing coal this year, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=224.4s)]
*  if someone's been a very bad boy or not, but I do think what is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=230.0s)]
*  happening now is there are certain facts that are known right so we know about a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=235.84s)]
*  meeting that occurred we saw as attorneys outside you know there's major [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=239.6s)]
*  reporting about that that usually is at the end of an investigation we know [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=244.44s)]
*  there's a target letter that is I think very substantial that's you know very [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=248.44s)]
*  very clear sign that Trump is going to be indicted in this in this investigation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=254.0s)]
*  I think a lot of the rest of what we're hearing are echoes of assumptions that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=259.64s)]
*  people are making and their own understanding of events in other words [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=264.12s)]
*  reporters are hearing from Trump's lawyers all sorts of theories and ideas [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=268.0s)]
*  about what's happening they're not hearing from Jack Smith the guy that you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=272.28s)]
*  know we rarely catch on video an NBC reporter might catch a very you know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=276.52s)]
*  what he's on his way back from Subway what we're really getting is these [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=282.4s)]
*  faint echoes and so but I do think as George said is really coming to a you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=286.04s)]
*  know coming to a head right now and that's the important point. George let me [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=292.2s)]
*  ask you about this venue issue and I know no one has any again special [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=295.48s)]
*  insight into this to stress what Renato just said right but we do know that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  there's you know there is this grand jury in Florida it appears to be [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  fairly new and and I think the informed speculation about that is that you want [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=307.24s)]
*  to avoid venue problems that if you indict them in Washington on events that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=312.88s)]
*  happen specifically in Florida you could be setting yourself up for venue [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  challenges those venue challenges could be difficult they could hand some sort [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=321.32s)]
*  of tool to the defense I'm just curious your thoughts on that. Well I mean the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=325.12s)]
*  Sixth Amendment provides that the criminal defendant defendant in a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=330.72s)]
*  criminal case is entitled to a jury from the state and the district in which the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  alleged crime was committed and that's the bottom that's the bottom principle [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=338.92s)]
*  now how that's applied depends on the particular facts of the case of a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=342.52s)]
*  particular case is we don't know all the facts here but we know a lot of the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=346.48s)]
*  facts a lot of the things that were bad occurred in Florida although some of the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  bad things were directed at an investigation that was being conducted [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=354.84s)]
*  from Washington and there is not just because the Constitution has clear words [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=357.96s)]
*  on it doesn't mean that the case law is necessarily that clear as it applies [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=363.52s)]
*  specific statutes and specific factual scenarios and as I understand it the law [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=366.52s)]
*  isn't necessarily uniform from district to district so they're going to try to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=372.44s)]
*  minimize the risk of having having an indictment bounced by bringing you know [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=375.79999999999995s)]
*  taking their best shot where they want where they think they most likely is to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  stick and given the amount of activity that went on in Florida bad activity [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=384.24s)]
*  it's not surprising that they have a grand jury going there yeah it's well [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=389.2s)]
*  said George Conway Renato Mariotti thank you both gentlemen [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=393.12s)]
*  I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=397.76s)]
*  never be president of the United States and anyone who asks someone else to put [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=402.12s)]
*  them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=409.04s)]
*  the grift from this family is breathtaking it's breathtaking Jared [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=414.0s)]
*  Kushner and Ivanka Kushner walk out of the White House and months later get 2 [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=420.92s)]
*  billion dollars from the Saudis 2 billion dollars from the Saudis you think [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=426.28s)]
*  it's because he's some kind of investing genius or do you think it's because he [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=432.8s)]
*  was sitting next to the president United States for four years doing favors for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=436.68s)]
*  the Saudis that's your money that's your money he stole and gave it to his [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=440.04s)]

*  just the last 24 hours three new candidates have joined officially the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  Republican primary last night it was former New Jersey governor Chris [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=456.6s)]
*  Christie today it was former vice president Mike Pence as well as North [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  Dakota governor Doug Burgum in all there are now ten candidates running for the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=463.12s)]
*  nomination and that tracks the 2016 race when exactly ten candidates had [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=468.2s)]
*  announced by this point on including Donald Trump who did not announce until [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=472.68s)]
*  mid-june of course that field eventually blew up to 17 candidates by the fall [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=477.12s)]
*  George Pataki actually forgot that until I looked at that graphic there are a lot [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=482.44s)]
*  of differences between that race in this one for one thing I think there's an [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  increasing belief that Florida governor Rhonda Santas might be a bit overhyped [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=490.94s)]
*  but he is pulling in 25 30 percent polls and of course there's an enormous [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=494.6s)]
*  obvious front right right Donald Trump who's leading the field and between the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=499.48s)]
*  two of them they're drawing 70 percent of voters but on top of that there's the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=503.6s)]
*  potential for Donald Trump to face yet another indictment possibly more Sarah [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=508.8s)]
*  Longwell is a publisher of the bulwark host of the focus group podcast and she [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  joins me now first I want to start with this this point about the logic of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=517.2s)]
*  entering the race you've got polling here's the latest Republican primary [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=521.08s)]
*  poll so you've got Trump at 56 and DeSantis at 22 it's still very early but [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=524.96s)]
*  that's super different than than 2015 right this you know 78 percent of voters [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=529.08s)]
*  clustered around these two candidates my thinking is that the general thinking [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=535.32s)]
*  of everyone else is DeSantis really ain't all that and Lord knows what's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=540.72s)]
*  gonna happen to Donald Trump is that how you see it I guess I mean I think [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=544.8s)]
*  it's different for different people I think there are some of them that are [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=551.4s)]
*  running for maybe vice president more than they are president I think there [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=555.3599999999999s)]
*  are people who are in it for the name ID I did not know who the governor of North [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=559.76s)]
*  Dakota was and now I do so he's already doing something there you've got Vimic [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  Ramaswamy somebody I had never heard of and you know Chris Christie I think is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=571.44s)]
*  getting in really to try to go hard at Trump because he thinks that there's a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=576.44s)]
*  market to do that so I think there's a variety of reasons for people getting in [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=580.44s)]
*  I think for Mike Pence he thinks God really wants him to be president I think [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=584.36s)]
*  he always thought he also really wants to be president he really wants to be [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  God agree on that that's right unfortunately you know who doesn't agree [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=594.08s)]
*  is the voters I mean I'm not sure there is anybody that we talked to in the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=598.56s)]
*  focus groups who are more savage they who they are more savage to well then [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=602.8399999999999s)]
*  Mike Pence I want to talk about that because Ben my former colleague Benji [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=607.3599999999999s)]
*  Sarlin is now at semaphore made a point today which I thought was interesting [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=611.4799999999999s)]
*  said look on paper just on paper if you say I liked I love Trump I'm a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=614.4s)]
*  conservative Republican I like Trump everything but the January 6th up that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=619.64s)]
*  was too much and maybe like the tweeting on paper that's the Pence pitch right [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=623.92s)]
*  like Trump minus minus the country's first coup is basically the Pence pitch [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  and yet that doesn't like that's on paper but in reality that doesn't seem [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=635.04s)]
*  to be selling yeah I mean here's the problem for Mike Pence he's in the sour [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  spot with voters either the the people who really love Trump think that he is a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=643.24s)]
*  trader they you know wish him ill and then there's the crowd that just thinks [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=647.84s)]
*  he's boring or thinks he's a nice guy but sort of doesn't have a political [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=655.48s)]
*  future the thing that's happened in our politics is people really crave now a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=659.84s)]
*  certain combative style that Mike Pence to his credit does not have and I think [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=663.76s)]
*  it's a evidence of the dysfunction of the Republican Party that there is no [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=669.88s)]
*  chance that Mike Pence could win a Republican primary yeah I was just a [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=674.2s)]
*  people Republican primary voters I think just just to specify I know you meant [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=679.08s)]
*  that but I because I do think I think the general voter is actually way less [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=682.84s)]
*  into the combative shtick and honestly I think there's a case to be made that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=687.72s)]
*  like a sort of non-compatitive and more boring candidate might actually perform [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=692.1600000000001s)]
*  better in a general election I don't know but I think there's certainly a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  case for that but the desire the thirst for blood combat on the primary folks in [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=700.08s)]
*  your focus group people is pretty clear right it's super clear and look you take [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=705.6s)]
*  a guy like Tim Scott I think Tim Scott would be a phenomenal general election [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=709.76s)]
*  candidate I think that he would do really well with swing voters I think [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  the chances of his sort of optimistic pitch getting out of a Republican primary [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  is really slim sunny optimism is not where the voters have been and a lot of [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  that is because Trump again has sort of trained people to feel sort of in a [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=729.52s)]
*  constant state of grievance a constant state of anger and so you know really [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=734.4s)]
*  what people are looking for when they say they want somebody besides Trump is [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=739.0s)]
*  they say Trump without the baggage that is the phrase I always hear and that has [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=742.52s)]
*  been sort of the DeSantis pitch and I think you know there's a reason why the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=747.0799999999999s)]
*  vast majority of the party wants one of those two people and I'll just add one [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=751.56s)]
*  thing you know for a lot of these candidates who ran in the pre-Trump era [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=755.04s)]
*  ran in the last back in 2016 the voters have a real sense of sort of the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=758.52s)]
*  before-times candidates the people who were there before Trump and they think [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=763.64s)]
*  of them as establishment they have no interest in them I can't tell you what [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=767.8s)]
*  it means to be kind of a before-times establishment candidate that is just not [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=771.96s)]
*  what Republican primary voters want I wish I could tell my 24 year old self how [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=775.6s)]
*  central America is a hellhole will be to the messaging and the American right [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=780.16s)]
*  here in 2023 bizarre Sarah longwell thank you very much thank you [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3cYUsjUdYc&t=785.52s)]
