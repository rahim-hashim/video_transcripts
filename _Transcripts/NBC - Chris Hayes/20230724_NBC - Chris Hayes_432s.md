# When Trump could be indicted over Jan. 6 explains DOJ alum
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE)
*  And today, Andrew Weissman, lead prosecutor and special counsel Robert Mueller's office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=0.0s)]
*  tweeted this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=4.4s)]
*  It seems like a distinct possibility that we will learn today that the Trump defense [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  team has presented appeal to the Department of Justice regarding the January 6th charges. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=10.24s)]
*  And then upon the rejection of that appeal, Jack Smith will seek the indictment tomorrow [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=16.0s)]
*  or Thursday at the latest in D.C. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=20.0s)]
*  Andrew Weissman is also the co-host of the podcast, Prosecuting Donald Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  It's excellent. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=27.48s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=28.56s)]
*  So Andrew, first of all, I have to ask you about that tweet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=30.64s)]
*  Is there anything you've learned since you tweeted that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=33.24s)]
*  Any new news you have to share with us? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=36.08s)]
*  No. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=38.0s)]
*  But let me tell you about why I tweeted that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=39.0s)]
*  So we know that the grand jury sits on Tuesdays and Thursdays in D.C. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=41.36s)]
*  And the case is going to be brought in D.C. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=46.32s)]
*  So for people who are concerned that it might be in Florida again, that's not going to happen [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=48.72s)]
*  because the gravamen of the case is there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=52.64s)]
*  There's cameras all over the place in D.C. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=55.32s)]
*  I've been on the other side of that, so I know how that feels. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And then the other thing is that before a case is actually indicted, the defense will [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=62.44s)]
*  have an opportunity to be heard by both Jack Smith and by people at Maine, what's called [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=67.84s)]
*  Maine Justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=74.28s)]
*  And so that's really what I've been waiting for is that piece because once we have that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=75.72s)]
*  piece, it's going to go forward. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=79.36s)]
*  So could it be happening and we just don't know about it? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Is it typically very quiet? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=83.24s)]
*  It could be because this is one where it could be on the phone, it could be by Zoom, it could [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=85.36s)]
*  be we've seen it in person. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=89.88s)]
*  So it could be any of those things. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  So it is possible that it is quiet. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=93.68s)]
*  As you know, when things happen in Washington, it's hard to keep things quiet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=96.08s)]
*  So I thought we might get some word on that, but we haven't so far. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=99.92s)]
*  There's just a few reporters assigned to break news on this case out there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  So I wanted to ask you about Bernie Kerik. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=107.72s)]
*  First, I just wanted to start because I can't figure this out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=110.28s)]
*  Why Trump waived executive attorney client privilege here in this case? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=112.8s)]
*  What would have motivated him to do that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=118.64s)]
*  So so for you, Bernie Kerik is very close to Rudy Giuliani. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=120.28s)]
*  He served as his chief investigator and Rudy Giuliani was looking at whether there was [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=124.88s)]
*  fraud in the election. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=129.76s)]
*  Bernie Kerik is also a felon and he was pardoned by Donald Trump. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=131.24s)]
*  So that's his history. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  So on the issue of why he would waive, it's important. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=137.12s)]
*  This is like going to be super in the weeds. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=142.0s)]
*  But here we go. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=143.96s)]
*  So there are two types of privilege. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=146.24s)]
*  There's attorney client privilege and then there's something called work product. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  Attorney client is very sacrosanct. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  That's very hard to pierce. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=154.24s)]
*  We've seen an example where there's crime fraud, where it's pierced work product. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=155.8s)]
*  Much easier for the government to get at it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a work product that was waived. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=163.44s)]
*  And that's one where I think this is a little bit snow and winter because although nowadays [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=165.88s)]
*  that's actually something. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=171.4s)]
*  But you know, when it used to be there was a lot of snow in winter. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=172.4s)]
*  That's one where I think Jack Smith would have been able to get that information anyway. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=176.12s)]
*  So it's not much of a give there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=180.08s)]
*  So don't over read into that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=182.6s)]
*  OK, so Jack Smith, what is he looking to gain from all of these documents? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=183.84s)]
*  And Bernie Kerik coming to see his team in two weeks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=188.24s)]
*  Yeah, so you know how we've heard that there were all sorts of people who told the former [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=191.36s)]
*  president that he lost? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  We've heard that he learned that from campaign people, from communications people, from people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  His own chief of staff was joking about the lack of voter fraud. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=203.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=206.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=207.96s)]
*  So if you have Rudy Giuliani and his chief investigator who were supposed to be looking [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=208.96s)]
*  for fraud, getting access to what they came up with is useful. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=213.08s)]
*  So if they came up with nothing, that is a really useful fact if you're trying to show [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=218.16s)]
*  that Donald Trump had no good faith belief that his mens rea was malignant, that it actually [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=222.32s)]
*  fits the criminal statute. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=229.8s)]
*  And we have reason to think that that is exactly what these documents will show because we [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=231.48s)]
*  have a little window in the Rudy Giuliani disbarment proceedings. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=235.44s)]
*  You really can't make this up. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  But it's like, but in the movie. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  No, all of this is a movie. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=243.92s)]
*  So in the Rudy Giuliani disbarment proceedings, not in New York, but in D.C. because he's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=244.92s)]
*  facing not one, but two disbarment proceedings. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  There they had Bernie Kerik documents. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=252.56s)]
*  And what they said about them is they had no probative value. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  They looked at them and said there was nothing there at all. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=261.18s)]
*  So what a human non-legal speak. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=264.52s)]
*  Does that mean these 2000 documents? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=266.08s)]
*  I don't speak non-human. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=268.44s)]
*  Well, I'm working with you here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=269.44s)]
*  I'm luring you out of the legal hole. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  It means that these 2000 documents, what they're looking for is that there might be no evidence [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  at all. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=278.4s)]
*  And we don't expect there to be voter fraud. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=279.4s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  They're looking to see if there's nothing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=281.86s)]
*  And obviously if there is something there, if you're a prosecutor, you want to know that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=283.28s)]
*  So either way, it's something they want to know. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=286.68s)]
*  Now these Mark Meadows tax messages, of which there are many, and I just had one example [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=288.88s)]
*  there, where it makes clear he does not buy this notion of voter fraud. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=296.08s)]
*  What do you? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=301.52s)]
*  How problematic is this for Mark Meadows? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=302.68s)]
*  Is he in legal trouble here? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  Or OK, how serious is his legal trouble? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, obviously from one document, it's not that's not enough to build a whole criminal [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=309.96s)]
*  case. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=315.08s)]
*  But, you know, he was in a lot of meetings. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=316.08s)]
*  And the reason that is a document that everyone's focusing on is he, for instance, was on the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=318.32s)]
*  calls to Georgia saying there's fraud in the election. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=325.28s)]
*  Well, if he is having these private messages, including with his own son saying, you know, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=329.32s)]
*  the fraud that we've seen is like one or two people, that's not fraud to change the results [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=335.08s)]
*  of the election. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=339.8s)]
*  That's not the 11,000 votes that you need. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=340.8s)]
*  So that is a very... [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=343.96s)]
*  There was even a joke about finding 10,000 additional votes with the White House lawyer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=344.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=348.68s)]
*  So that is, you know, if you are, just imagine if you're a prosecutor, you're thinking good [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=349.68s)]
*  luck with the jury. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=352.8s)]
*  You know, they're going to look at this and say you knew exactly that you were misleading [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  the state legislature. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=359.36s)]
*  And how does Jack Smith, you don't know what's in all of the documents, but how does Jack [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  Smith use those text messages or Mark Meadows joking about this on a Trump case? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=365.04s)]
*  So obviously, if Mark Meadows is a defendant, if he is charged, those are what's called [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=371.16s)]
*  an admission. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=377.32s)]
*  It's a direct admission. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=378.32s)]
*  It could also come in under the rules of evidence as a state, what's called a statement [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=380.44s)]
*  against interest and potentially also as a co-conspirator statement. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=384.84s)]
*  So there are a lot of different theories, but you're right to flag that because some [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=388.68s)]
*  of the things that might be very damaging as to one defendant don't always come in as [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=392.24s)]
*  to every defendant. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvV3v6cptE&t=396.44s)]
