# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Feb. 1
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, we got some news today that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=0.0s)]
*  confirms something that we kind of knew already, which is the Republican Party [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=3.4s)]
*  doesn't really exist anymore as an institution. It has essentially been [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=6.96s)]
*  cannibalized by Donald Trump, subsumed into MAGA, with profound implications [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=11.92s)]
*  both for Republicans and for the American democratic system as a whole. You [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=17.6s)]
*  can see the evidence of this everywhere you look, like a new revelation that the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=22.16s)]
*  Republican National Committee's anemic fundraising has left it with a paltry [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=26.56s)]
*  eight million dollars on hand. Not exactly the war chest a major political [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  party needs in an election year, especially considering Democrats have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=35.68s)]
*  nearly three times as much in their coffers. Speaking to Puck, one RNC member [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=38.84s)]
*  offered this blunt assessment, quote, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Puck also reports Trump world is rather unhappy with the state of affairs at the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  RNC, and they are looking to install a MAGA loyalist at the top, something Steve [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=55.16s)]
*  Bannon openly advocated for earlier this week when he called for the ouster of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=59.28s)]
*  party chair Ronna Romney McDaniel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  Why is Ronna McDaniel and that team over there? They don't want to do it because [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=67.4s)]
*  they understand they're culpable. What in the hell was RNC doing? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=70.52s)]
*  They're guilty of a mortal sin against this republic, and that sin is not going [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=76.64s)]
*  to go away until she is removed as the chairman of the RNC. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=82.24s)]
*  I'm tired of the happy talk and we're going to you know why she's got to take [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=97.24s)]
*  out a line of credit because you cut her off, right? The war room. I said not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=100.56s)]
*  another penny, not another 25 bucks or 50 bucks a month, not one cent until [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  they're gone. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=112.0s)]
*  Okay, now let's just be clear here. The idea that Steve Bannon, two shirt is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=113.96s)]
*  strategic genius, is solely responsible for the pitiful fundraising. The [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=117.72s)]
*  committee is laughable. That's not it. But it does remain true. The MAGA [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=121.88s)]
*  movement has had it with the RNC, which is ironic for a number of reasons. First [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=125.88s)]
*  of all, because RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel is so unabashedly pro MAGA, she [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=129.6s)]
*  tried to pressure Nikki Haley, Trump's only credible remaining opponent in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=134.72s)]
*  Republican primary to drop out, only for Trump to then stab McDaniel in the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=138.28s)]
*  back so he could play benevolent dictator and say that Haley should stay [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=142.08s)]
*  in the race. It's also ironic because Trump, of all people, is partially [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  responsible for the RNC's financial rows because his super PACs are hoovering up [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=150.24s)]
*  all of the small dollar donations so he can use them to pay his tens of millions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=155.84s)]
*  of dollars in legal bills. And to be clear, it is always the case to some [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=161.36s)]
*  extent the presidential candidate and their movement controls the purse [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=165.24s)]
*  strings of their respective parties during election year. But Trump is just [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=168.16s)]
*  on another level as he subsumes the Republican Party into his own party of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=171.88s)]
*  one. And you can see the trickle down effects of this all over the country as [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=176.12s)]
*  the Republican Party as a party destroys itself like a snake eating its own tail. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=179.8s)]
*  A lot of the problems that becomes Trump himself is a conspiracy obsessed maniac [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=184.96s)]
*  who cultivates the most deranged characteristics in his diehard policies. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=189.84s)]
*  In Michigan, the state Republican Party voted to fire its head, Christina Caramo, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  earlier this month and replace her with Pete Hoekstra, a former Republican [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=200.08s)]
*  congressman and Trump ambassador to the Netherlands. If you're a regular watcher [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  of this program, you might remember Caramo. She's the election denying [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=207.8s)]
*  conspiracy theorist who ran to be Michigan's secretary of state in 2022. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=211.12s)]
*  Having intimate relationships with people who are demonically possessed or [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=216.56s)]
*  oppressed, I strongly believe that a person opens themselves up to possession. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=219.8s)]
*  Demonic possession is real. How people become possessed, I don't know all the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=224.56s)]
*  details of it, but I was surmised that the sexual licentiousness in our culture [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=228.76s)]
*  is a lot of spiritual things that go on wrong. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=234.56s)]
*  So she didn't win that race in 2022, thankfully, and you can see why [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=238.44s)]
*  Michigan Republicans have decided they don't want Caramo running the show [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  anymore. Here's the thing. She's refusing to step down and it's now splitting its [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=245.16s)]
*  party in half. In fact, the RNC held a big meeting today with representatives [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  from across the nation and Michigan Republicans did not have a seat at [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=254.16s)]
*  the table because Caramo refuses to step down and hand the reins to Hoekstra. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=257.6s)]
*  In fact, both of them showed up today, each claiming they are in charge [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=262.8s)]
*  of the Michigan Republican Party and neither one was officially recognized [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  by the RNC. Now, factional weirdness happens in politics all the time, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=270.32s)]
*  these kind of party fights. So if this was a one off, you could say, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=274.76s)]
*  ah, yeah. But it's not just Michigan. This is a trend, okay? In Arizona, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=277.12s)]
*  you've got the failed MAGA gubernatorial candidate, Kerry Lake, who is now [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=282.68s)]
*  involved in a convoluted feud that has pushed out that state's Republican [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  chairman, Jeff DeWitt. Now, depending on who you ask, DeWitt either tried [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=290.44s)]
*  to bribe Lake to stay out of the upcoming Senate race or he was the victim [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  of an elaborate scheme from Lake to oust him from his position so that she [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=298.4s)]
*  can claim total control of the state party. Now, there's a new head of the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=302.0s)]
*  Arizona Republican Party, a so-called election integrity activist who worked [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=306.36s)]
*  on Trump's 2020 campaign. Although her election to party chair wasn't all [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=310.88s)]
*  smooth sailing, as the New York Times reports, get this, quote, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  the vote was delayed by a lengthy debate over a motion to ban the use [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=318.88s)]
*  of electronic tabulators mistrusted by many election deniers of the party [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  to count the ballots. But we're not done. Meanwhile, in Nevada, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=328.44s)]
*  where the Republican Party is run by a guy who was literally criminally indicted [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  for his role in Trump's state collector scheme, the state is holding both [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  the Republican primary and the caucus next week because of some complicated [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=340.4s)]
*  infighting. Nikki Haley would be on the primary ballot while Donald Trump [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  will be competing in the caucus. Now, the caucus is the one actually awarding [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=349.32s)]
*  delegates, which means the whole contest is basically rigged in his favor, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  which is the whole point of them concocting this entire enterprise. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=357.12s)]
*  Also, another irony, of course, because if the situation was reversed, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=361.08s)]
*  Trump would be railing to anyone and everyone about how the contest is [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  being stolen from him. And this is what you got to understand. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=368.84s)]
*  When he calls things rigged, that is an aspiration. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=371.84s)]
*  It's not moral condemnation. He wants things to be rigged in his favor. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=376.56s)]
*  That is his model. He thinks everything is rigged and should be rigged [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  in his favor. And I'm pretty sure, to be fair, he would win a fully fair, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=383.4s)]
*  unrigged Republican primary. That said, it's hard to disentangle the current mess [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=388.52s)]
*  the party finds itself in from Trump and his movement's obvious power grab, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=392.32s)]
*  the complete control the MAGA movement has over the entirety of the party [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=396.88s)]
*  apparatus. And again, this isn't just some backroom politics of the RNC [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=400.76s)]
*  and the Republican Party. This is Donald Trump's vision for the entire country, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  to bend the fabric of reality and the American experiment and its political [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=414.44s)]
*  system to his whims. The current broken state of the Republican Party, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  which is now run by cranks whose only qualification is their filthy to him, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=423.28s)]
*  is his vision for the whole U.S. government. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=428.24s)]
*  I'm right now, as you know, in a very tough reelection race in Texas. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=432.64s)]
*  The Democrats, Chuck Schumer has made clear I'm his number one target. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=437.36s)]
*  The Democrats intend to spend over a hundred million dollars to defeat me in Texas. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=441.0s)]
*  We just had a poll last week that showed it as a one point race. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  And yet we can expect Mitch again not to spend any money to defend me. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm sitting in a glass house throwing stones. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=455.88s)]
*  Take it from someone who knows that guy really likes the sound of his own voice. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=457.88s)]
*  The last time that Ted Cruz ran for reelection, he sweated out a narrow victory over Beto O'Rourke [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=462.68s)]
*  of less than three points. You would think that would be a wake up call for the Texas senator to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  start laser focusing on the needs of his constituents. But instead, just over two years [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=471.88s)]
*  after his narrow victory, he tried to secretly jet off to Cancun during the worst weather [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=476.76s)]
*  disaster his state had seen in a long time, one that killed nearly 250 people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=480.84s)]
*  Recently, it seems like he's basically reduced himself to being a part-time senator [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=486.36s)]
*  and nearly full-time podcaster. Get this, last week he posted five different episodes, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=490.84s)]
*  five different podcast episodes. He's a senator. He is now facing another real reelection challenge. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=498.2s)]
*  As you heard, he's a little worried he's not getting the support he needs from fellow Republicans. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=504.92s)]
*  Congressman Colin Allred of Texas is running in the Democratic race against Texas State Senator [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=509.56s)]
*  Roland Gutierrez and others to challenge Cruz. He previously served in the Department of Housing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=513.88s)]
*  and Urban Development under President Obama. Before that, he was an NFL linebacker and I [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  just learned he's a fourth generation tax-sending joint. Good to have you here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=522.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=525.4s)]
*  Okay, this is, people might think this is weird or petty, but I'm going to talk. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=526.9200000000001s)]
*  I think it's weird for a U.S. senator to do five podcasts episodes a week. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=530.36s)]
*  I'm not wrong. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=534.36s)]
*  That's right. No, that's right. It's very time consuming. When I appear on a podcast, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=535.0s)]
*  it takes time, but being the host, and he normally does three a week, so that was actually news for [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=539.24s)]
*  me that he was up to five. He's a media personality. He's not serious about being a senator. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=544.84s)]
*  I feel like there's some level at which maybe if you beat him, you help him. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=548.92s)]
*  He really just wants to do that full-time, which again, no shade. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=553.96s)]
*  You might be giving him a hand. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=558.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he wants to do. He's not a serious legislator. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=559.5600000000001s)]
*  We're talking about these negotiations in the Senate right now. You'll never see him a part [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  of those negotiations. He won't be rolling up his sleeves and trying to figure out a compromise on [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  how we can legislate to move forward. This is what he does. He goes on podcasts. He goes on cable [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  news, and that's what he does. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=574.76s)]
*  And in fact, I thought this border story that we just talked about, you would have a lot to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=575.64s)]
*  say about. You have been critical of the handling by this President, Joe Biden, of the border. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=579.88s)]
*  You are among three Texas Democrats who voted to condemn the president's handling [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=585.16s)]
*  of the southern border. You touted your own bipartisan legislation, would help secure the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=588.68s)]
*  border, provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and others who are living here, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=592.92s)]
*  follow laws, surge resources to border patrol and border communities. So you've been [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=596.28s)]
*  trying to work on something like this. The Senate compromise doesn't even have some of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  the stuff in here. There's no path to citizenship for the Dreamers, all this. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=605.88s)]
*  I know we don't have paper on it yet, but would you support that legislation? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=610.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think so. We haven't gotten all the details, but from what we are seeing, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=613.4s)]
*  it looks like it's an attempt to deal with an asylum system that's broken, to a faster process, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=617.0s)]
*  and to set some standards that I think probably have to be set in terms of what's the threshold [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=622.68s)]
*  to have your asylum claim heard. But listen, Ted Cruz is not going to be a part of any of this. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=626.76s)]
*  And he said in a Senate meeting, it kind of leaked out, I guess, a lunch meeting of theirs, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=631.96s)]
*  that he's worried about the politics of it, not the policy, the politics of it. And that's where [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=636.52s)]
*  the cynicism comes in. That's what I think Texans are so sick of. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=640.68s)]
*  I think he said both privately and publicly. So I think what happened was that there was that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=644.2s)]
*  caucus lunch they all had after the deal was struck. And it was after Trump won New Hampshire, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=647.96s)]
*  McConnell's like, the politics of this have changed. We need the crisis. Basically, he didn't [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=652.2s)]
*  say this, but we want the crisis to keep going. I guess it makes me wonder, maybe they don't think [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=656.04s)]
*  it's correct. I mean, I just find it pretty wild. To me, it's a really defining issue about the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=662.04s)]
*  nature of these different senators. Like Langford is a conservative dude in your neighboring state [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=667.0s)]
*  of Oklahoma. He's not like a squish. And he's running around being like, guys, we got it. Let's [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=671.88s)]
*  do it. That's right. Also for Texas, we're a border state. And so there's probably no state that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=677.32s)]
*  would, that needs this to be addressed more. The vast majority of the crossings are happening in [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=682.2s)]
*  Texas. That's right. You know, we have a record number in December of over 300,000. Texas feels [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  that. So you would think that a Texas senator would then say, I want to respond to this and find a way [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=691.32s)]
*  legislatively. But of course, as we saw in the clip there, and as we know from his character, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=696.28s)]
*  he's just looking for the next election so he can keep podcasting. One of the, one of the issues [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=700.44s)]
*  that I think there will be a very clear difference between if you were to win the nomination. I think [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=705.32s)]
*  any Democrat, frankly, against Ted Cruz will be on the issue of abortion. He is strongly in favor [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=709.08s)]
*  of the Supreme Court's DAB decision, strongly opposed to abortion rights. I want to just play [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=714.5200000000001s)]
*  a little bit of your campaign ad because I think it highlights the message that you or other [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=720.12s)]
*  Democrats, not just in Texas, are going to be running on in this year. Take a listen. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=724.84s)]
*  So for women in this state, the fear is real. Texas's abortion ban is a threat to their lives, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=727.88s)]
*  to all of our freedom. That's why I'm running for Senate to end this abortion ban [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=734.6s)]
*  because in Texas, we stand up for freedom. Your state has a very restrictive ban. It was at the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=739.4s)]
*  front edge of this, obviously, with the SB8 law. Do you think a abortion rights referendum [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=745.16s)]
*  statewide would win in Texas? I think it would. I don't think the legislature will let us do that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=754.44s)]
*  They never will. No. But, you know, what's happening in Texas is a tragedy. It really is. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=759.0s)]
*  What we are seeing is what a total ban on abortion looks like, which is, you know, a mother of two [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=764.6s)]
*  who has a much-wanted third pregnancy, who has to go to the emergency room four times. Her doctor [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=769.6400000000001s)]
*  tells her she needs a medically necessary abortion. She asks her state to get that care close to home, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=773.96s)]
*  and they say no. And they don't just say no. They say we're going to prosecute your doctor, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=778.6s)]
*  your hospital. You're going to be subject to this ridiculous bounty law that we have in this state. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=781.88s)]
*  We have counties saying you can't drive through our county if you're going to use those roads [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=785.4s)]
*  to access an abortion. There's one thing I know about Texans, and as you said, I'm a four-generation [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=789.32s)]
*  Texan. I went to Baylor. My family's from Brownsville. I grew up in Dallas. I know who we are. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=793.4s)]
*  We believe in freedom, and this is not freedom. This is not who we are, and that's why we have [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=797.32s)]
*  to make sure that folks know the only way we can fix this is by beating Ted Cruz and codifying at [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=802.4399999999999s)]
*  the federal level Roe v. Wade. Our state's not going to do it, but we can do it at the federal [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=806.84s)]
*  level. We can restore this right. The president had a rally where he said he pledged to do that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=810.28s)]
*  There had been this sort of push and pull about a clarity on the message from Democrats, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  which is like you can't unring the bell of Roe. The court is what it is. But do you think there's [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  unanimity across all aspects of the Democratic Party that this is a singular focus for all of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=826.28s)]
*  you running in contested swing races in the House, in Senate races, and at the top of the ticket? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=831.0s)]
*  Well, it should be, because we have to. We passed in the last Congress a couple of times [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=835.72s)]
*  Women's Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe. We couldn't get it to the Senate, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=840.3599999999999s)]
*  even though we had 50 votes. When I'm in the Senate, we will have to get that done, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=843.64s)]
*  because we have to restore these rights. And I'm a voting rights lawyer as well before [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=847.64s)]
*  I came to Congress. We have to restore that right as well. We have to go back and I think [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=851.56s)]
*  solidify some of these foundational rights that have been eroded by what I think is a rogue Supreme [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=856.1999999999999s)]
*  Court and also, of course, years of inaction and unable to get things to the Senate. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  Um, final question for you. Do you think you can go talk to the folks of Texas about this Biden [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=864.9200000000001s)]
*  economy or this economy? Well, listen, with a story to tell. Yeah. Well, you know, I come from [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=871.08s)]
*  a family where I was raised by a single mom was a public school teacher. We were kind of on the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=875.8000000000001s)]
*  side of the way you swipe your debit card and you pray when you go to the store. So I know, you know, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=879.8000000000001s)]
*  what families have been facing, but I also know who's fighting to lower your costs. Who wants to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=884.84s)]
*  expand the child tax credit? So 16 million kids will benefit from it. Who wants to lower your [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=889.0s)]
*  health care costs and kept the cost of insulin at 35 bucks a month? Ted Cruz voted against that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=893.4s)]
*  Who are they looking out for? As I think you've talked about in the previous segment and who are [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=898.28s)]
*  we looking out for? We want to lower your costs. We want to make life more affordable for you. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=901.72s)]
*  Want to give you a chance to chase your version of the American dream. We're on and I'm on your side. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=905.4s)]
*  That's my message. It's going to be all right. Congressman Colin already. That primary will be [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=909.56s)]
*  in March. If I'm not mistaken, right? Super Tuesday. We will be watching it closely. Thanks [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=913.16s)]
*  so much for coming by. Thank you. Come by anytime you're in New York. Thanks a lot. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiOmfxRHjw&t=917.0799999999999s)]
