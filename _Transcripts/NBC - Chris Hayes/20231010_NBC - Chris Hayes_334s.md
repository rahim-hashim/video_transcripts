# ‘Human shields’ Israel grapples with complexity of rescuing Hamas’ hostages
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38)
*  Ali Velshi has reported extensively from war zones across the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=0.0s)]
*  He spent a lot of time in both Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  He's host of Velshi and MSNBC. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  He joins me now live from Ashdod, Israel, about 15 miles from the border with Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=6.88s)]
*  Ali, I imagine the nation is in anguish and shock and grief. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  How are people processing what has happened there in Israel and your day reporting there? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=17.92s)]
*  ALI VELSHI, MSNBC HOST, GSA, GSA, MSNBC, GSA, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=24.28s)]
*  MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, MSNBC, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm on edge in this entire region. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=27.159999999999997s)]
*  I've been speaking to a number of Israeli Defense Force members today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  And at one point today, something happened around us, and 50 of them started running [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=34.16s)]
*  by with their guns. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=38.599999999999994s)]
*  Everybody is on edge. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=41.32s)]
*  In fact, as we're speaking right now, I just mentioned to my team that we hadn't heard [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=42.32s)]
*  bombing in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  It's 15 miles over there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  We hadn't heard bombing for a while. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  The way the bombing is working is, there are four-hour shifts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  The bombs come, the missiles come from the Navy off the coast of Gaza for four hours, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=54.32s)]
*  and then the fighter jets start. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=60.08s)]
*  Now the fighter jets have started, and we're hearing, you might hear it, or you might see [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=62.24s)]
*  it on the other camera that we've got. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=65.76s)]
*  Every couple of minutes or so, you see another explosion in Gaza, and you hear the sound. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=67.84s)]
*  Now, the issue here, Chris, is that there are two camps in Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=72.56s)]
*  There is the very frustrated, fearful, angry camp of people who want Hamas destroyed, and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=78.2s)]
*  they want to see the strongest possible attack in response to the strongest terrorist attack [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=85.88s)]
*  that this country has seen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=91.16s)]
*  On the other hand, there are the families, as you said, of not just the 150 or so hostages [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=93.16s)]
*  that Israel believes are being held in Gaza, but the people who don't know whether their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  family members are hostages or not. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  And there's another one of those booms as another missile strike hits Gaza. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=105.48s)]
*  Their families want them to be rescued first. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=110.0s)]
*  They want that to be the priority. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=114.0s)]
*  In fact, earlier today, I went to talk to a woman. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=115.84s)]
*  She is from the kibbutz which abuts Gaza, right on the other side of the fence, from [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=118.72s)]
*  which many people were killed and taken hostage. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=125.48s)]
*  She believed that her husband was a hostage, so we arranged to go and meet with her, and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=127.66s)]
*  as we approached, we heard her screaming. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=131.12s)]
*  We saw her on a balcony. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=133.56s)]
*  She was screaming into a phone, said, why are you telling me this by phone? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=134.56s)]
*  And what had turned out was that the army had just called her to tell her her husband [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=139.0s)]
*  was not a hostage, that he was dead. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=142.6s)]
*  He was found dead with a bullet through his head. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=144.36s)]
*  So she was too distraught to talk to us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=146.88s)]
*  In fact, her mother called an ambulance just to deal with the fact that she was as shattered [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=148.84s)]
*  and distraught as she was. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=153.96s)]
*  Her mother then came out to talk to me a little bit, and here's what she told me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=155.52s)]
*  Is she okay? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=161.56s)]
*  Do you want to go back to see her? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=162.56s)]
*  I go back. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=163.56s)]
*  She's not okay. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=164.56s)]
*  She won't be okay. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=165.56s)]
*  She won't be okay. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=166.56s)]
*  We cannot be okay after such a tragedy, but we will do our best that we can to help. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=167.56s)]
*  That's what we can. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=175.56s)]
*  We must be strong. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=176.56s)]
*  We must help. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=178.56s)]
*  A child by one month. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=180.56s)]
*  And that last thing she told me is that her daughter had a one-month-old child. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=186.56s)]
*  Her husband told her run with the baby. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=189.56s)]
*  They were trapped for 28 hours. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=191.56s)]
*  She ran with the baby. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=192.56s)]
*  She got out, got to a shelter. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=194.56s)]
*  The Army found her. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=196.56s)]
*  She went to her mother's house, and she had just been telling a reporter from Sky News [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=197.56s)]
*  before this news occurred that she's hoping that her husband is a hostage [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=200.56s)]
*  and that he'll be freed soon, Chris. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=204.56s)]
*  I want to just follow up on the hostage situation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=206.56s)]
*  Obviously, I think Hamas had put out a statement today threatening the lives of those hostages [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=209.56s)]
*  if Israel struck Gaza without warning, I think was what they said. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=214.56s)]
*  Obviously, this is incredibly complicating for the calculus here for the Israeli government. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=219.56s)]
*  150 hostages. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=225.56s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=226.56s)]
*  And what is being communicated about that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=228.56s)]
*  I mean, I have to imagine that their safety is very much front of mind as people process the effects of this atrocity. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=233.56s)]
*  So today, the families of the 100 or so people that Israel knows or thinks they know are hostages have been informed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=243.56s)]
*  The government's been reaching out to them to say, we believe your loved one is one of the hostages. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=252.56s)]
*  The problem with this is how do you get the hostages out? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=257.56s)]
*  There is no formal relationship. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=260.56s)]
*  There's no meaningful dialogue between Israel and Hamas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=262.56s)]
*  There's no meaningful dialogue between America and Hamas. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=265.56s)]
*  Hamas deals with Iran. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=268.56s)]
*  Hamas deals with Iran. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=269.56s)]
*  Hamas sometimes deals with Qatar. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=270.56s)]
*  So you can either negotiate a release. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=272.56s)]
*  At one point, Hamas had said, if you release, we'll give some people back in order for some prisoners. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=275.56s)]
*  We'll give your hostages back in order for every prisoner to be released. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=281.56s)]
*  That's not happening at the moment. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=285.56s)]
*  So the option B is, as you said, a ground offensive into Gaza to rescue these hostages. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=286.56s)]
*  But Gaza, Israel can see everything from the top in Gaza. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=291.56s)]
*  They have drones above Gaza all the time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=295.56s)]
*  They know what the topography looks like. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=297.56s)]
*  They have no idea what's inside those buildings or underneath those buildings. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=298.56s)]
*  Those hostages could be anywhere, and they could be human shields. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=301.56s)]
*  So the complexity of getting those hostages freed is really a major issue. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=304.56s)]
*  Ali Adelshi, thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=309.56s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=311.56s)]
*  Thanks for being there for us, really. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=312.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19B25my2N38&t=328.56s)]
