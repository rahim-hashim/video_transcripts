# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 2  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w)
*  Good evening from Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jason Johnson in for Chris Hayes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=7.4s)]
*  We are officially in an election year and 2024 brings with it a number of legal and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=9.96s)]
*  political hurdles for the quadruple indicted, twice impeached, disgraced ex-president. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  We are less than two weeks away from the first in the nation Iowa caucus. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=21.48s)]
*  While Trump is still a heavy favorite to win in the Hawkeye state, his future is far more [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=25.82s)]
*  uncertain from there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=30.82s)]
*  We are about three weeks out from the New Hampshire primary. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=32.02s)]
*  And while his lead there is still substantial, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=36.26s)]
*  has developed some late momentum. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=40.26s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump's electoral fortunes are closely linked to his legal jeopardy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=42.58s)]
*  As of now, he has already been kicked off the primary ballot in two Super Tuesday states, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=47.2s)]
*  Maine and Colorado under the 14th amendment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=53.14s)]
*  And on January 16th, the first of his many trials scheduled for this year is set to begin [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=56.14s)]
*  after Hail Mary attempts to delay the proceedings have failed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=61.9s)]
*  Trump is now set to begin his second trial for defaming writer, E. Jean Carroll, just [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=66.1s)]
*  one day after the Iowa caucuses. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=70.94s)]
*  Trump, you may remember, was already found liable once for defaming and sexually abusing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=73.18s)]
*  This second trial is for additional comments he made both while president and following [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=80.22s)]
*  that last verdict. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=85.82s)]
*  But it doesn't stop there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=87.46s)]
*  By the end of this month, we should have a judgment in the $250 million dollar civil [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  fraud trial against the Trump organization. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=94.98s)]
*  The judge in that case has already found the organization liable for fraud. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=97.9s)]
*  Now he will also determine if Trump and his adult sons engage in other misdeeds like falsifying [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  business records. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=108.62s)]
*  Not long after that, on March 4th, the day before Super Tuesday, the first of Trump's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  federal criminal trials, the election interference case, is set to begin, although that date [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=116.54s)]
*  is currently on hold pending appeal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=121.30000000000001s)]
*  But if it stands, it means Trump will be in the midst of a criminal trial on the busiest [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=123.7s)]
*  voting day of the primary. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=129.38s)]
*  And that will lead him directly to his second federal criminal trial, the Mar-a-Lago documents [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=131.78s)]
*  case, which is set to begin 11 weeks later in late May. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=136.78s)]
*  Followed by a third criminal trial, potentially right before convention season. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=141.98s)]
*  Fulton County DA Fonny Willis wants to bring the George election interference case in early [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=146.54s)]
*  August. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=152.62s)]
*  All of which means, if these dates stand, Donald Trump will spend basically all of primary [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=153.62s)]
*  season in court. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=158.86s)]
*  But the real question is, will Republican primary voters even care? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=161.48s)]
*  Even today, just days from the third anniversary of the January 6th attack on our democracy, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=165.74s)]
*  there's growing evidence that many Republican voters have simply stopped caring, if they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=171.18s)]
*  ever did, according to new polling data from the Washington Post. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=174.78s)]
*  Quote, Republicans are now less likely to believe that January 6th participants were [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=178.78s)]
*  mostly violent, less likely to believe Trump bears responsibility for the attack, and are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=184.66000000000003s)]
*  slightly less likely to view Joe Biden's election as legitimate than they were in December [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=189.82s)]
*  of 2021, just two years later. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=196.38s)]
*  Some Trump voters are moving further away from reality as we approach the next election, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=199.98s)]
*  and not closer to it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  And the ex-president himself is only fanning the flames as much as possible. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=206.34s)]
*  Today, he took to social media to share a ridiculous 32-page report he claims provides [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=209.82s)]
*  definitive proof that the 2020 election was stolen. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=216.1s)]
*  Of course, in reality, it does no such thing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=219.1s)]
*  But it does include such laughable claims as, quote, there's no evidence Joe Biden won, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=222.5s)]
*  and, quote, President Trump was right to voice his objections to what had unfolded before [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=227.54s)]
*  the country's eyes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=232.26s)]
*  He's still at it three years after he lost the election, and it looks like many of his [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=234.5s)]
*  supporters are more than willing to buy into his conspiratorial mindset, which is why, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=239.62s)]
*  more important than ever, that the ex-president is held responsible for his crimes against [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=244.66s)]
*  democracy because Trump is running to finish the job he started on January 6th. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=248.98s)]
*  Right now, he is asking his buddies on the 6-3 MAGA Supreme Court to give him immunity. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=254.42s)]
*  Any recent legal filing, special counsel Jack Smith outlines exactly why that should not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=260.78s)]
*  happen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=265.54s)]
*  Quote, rather than vindicating our constitutional framework, Trump's sweeping immunity claim [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=266.54s)]
*  threatens to licensed presidents to commit crimes to remain in office. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=273.22s)]
*  Three former Trump White House aides were more blunt in their assessment of the danger [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=278.86s)]
*  of their former boss. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=283.94000000000005s)]
*  He knows how to use government better this time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  He can put in diehard loyalists who can weaponize every level of government against his detractors, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=289.66s)]
*  against the American people, against the media. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=295.1s)]
*  It's almost too scary to fully wrap your head around what it could look like. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=298.26000000000005s)]
*  The American people and people in general have short memories, and so they might forget [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=301.66s)]
*  the chaos of the Trump years, and also they might not just be paying attention to what [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=306.36s)]
*  he's saying now and the threat to democracy that exists. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=311.3s)]
*  This is a fundamental election to continue to safeguard our institutions and our constitutional [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=315.66s)]
*  republic. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=319.74s)]
*  But if we crumble as a nation, we're setting the example for generations to come, not only [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=321.14s)]
*  in the United States, but on the global stage, that democracy is an experiment and it's not [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=326.42s)]
*  guaranteed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=331.54s)]
*  We're extremely fragile as a country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=332.54s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who sits on the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=336.74s)]
*  Judiciary Committee. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=340.62s)]
*  Thank you so much, Senator, for starting us off tonight on All-In. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=341.62s)]
*  I have to start with this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  What is just your first reaction to that schedule I laid out? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=348.06s)]
*  I know people wait for the NFL release and Major League Baseball releases, but I mean, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=352.18s)]
*  all of these trial dates laid out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  How do you think that's going to affect the ability for Americans to even concentrate [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=361.73999999999995s)]
*  on election when one of the major party candidates is very likely going to be walking in and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=365.82s)]
*  out of court for most of the summer? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=370.05999999999995s)]
*  Well, I hope it sticks. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=371.61999999999995s)]
*  This is a real challenge for rule of law in the United States of America, and rule of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=375.02s)]
*  law shouldn't evaporate simply because a lot of voters have decided to build a cult around [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=382.64s)]
*  a criminal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=388.48s)]
*  That doesn't trump rule of law. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=390.0s)]
*  So every single one of these, the criminal cases, the fraud case, the defamation case, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=392.72s)]
*  the separate related case about his immunity, Trump's immunity, all of that sets a really [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=401.88s)]
*  important set of historic questions for this country to answer, and many of them are going [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  to end up in front of a very magi-ized Supreme Court. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, one of the things, Senator, in that recent legal filing by Special Counsel Jack [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  Smith, I cited this a moment ago. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=424.88s)]
*  His prosecutors go on to say this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=427.32000000000005s)]
*  I want to just read you this quote, get your thoughts on the other side. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=428.56s)]
*  Quote, the defendant asserts that this prosecution threatens to shatter the very bedrock of our [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  republic. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=437.04s)]
*  To the contrary, is the defendant's claim that he cannot be held to answer for the charges [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=438.04s)]
*  that he engaged in an unprecedented effort to retain power through criminal means despite [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=443.16s)]
*  having lost the election that threatens the democratic and constitutional foundation of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=447.32s)]
*  our republic. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=451.72s)]
*  That's about as clear a message as we've seen from Smith's office. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=452.72s)]
*  You know, we're laying out, we know that Trump is a unique threat to American democracy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=456.92s)]
*  What do you think our government needs to do to make that clear to large amounts of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=462.32s)]
*  American people who maybe don't see how dangerous former President Trump is, or perhaps even [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=467.08s)]
*  some Republicans who for some reason seem less convinced of his danger today than they [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=472.58s)]
*  were two years ago? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=476.64s)]
*  Well, I think one thing is to have some confidence in the legal institutions of our country. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, when a Dominion was getting harassed and brutalized by the biggest megaphone on [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=485.32s)]
*  the planet, the Fox News Organization, in an honest courtroom, they forced Fox to shut [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=491.36s)]
*  up and to write them an enormous check. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  When the moms from Sandy Hook had to put up with this Infowars character pretending that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=501.92s)]
*  their children hadn't been killed and that the whole thing was a scam, there was no way [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=509.2s)]
*  that they could stop his bullying and his noise until they got him into an honest courtroom. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=513.0s)]
*  And suddenly he has to write them enormous checks and shut up. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=518.2s)]
*  And so, and of course, Jean Carroll is another example of somebody who is going to be a victim [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  of bullying until she got into an honest courtroom. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=526.0s)]
*  So I think we can have some confidence that honest courtrooms can remedy some of the bullying [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=529.36s)]
*  and the lies that is now endemic within our political system. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, that gets you to a Supreme Court that has to be willing to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=538.84s)]
*  follow the rule of law and not be subservient to political interests. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  Senator, with that in mind, the court, Chief Justice Roberts, just quietly released their [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=547.4s)]
*  end of year report. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=552.84s)]
*  Magically, it doesn't seem to talk too much about ethics or the massive, massive, massive [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  ethical lapses that we've seen brought forth by ProPublica and other outlets this year. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=560.88s)]
*  What can this government do? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=566.92s)]
*  What can the Democrats do? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=568.6s)]
*  What can President Biden do? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=570.04s)]
*  What should be done now to allow the American people to believe in the court again? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=571.48s)]
*  Because it is clearly a compromised institution, but will play a really critical role in the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=576.44s)]
*  defense, hopefully, of our democracy over the next eight to ten months. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=580.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes, an interesting dilemma, because on the one hand, the public isn't going to really [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=584.24s)]
*  understand what's going on at the Supreme Court until our investigation is complete. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=590.08s)]
*  You know, thanks to ProPublica and the New York Times and many people in your line of [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=593.84s)]
*  work, the word about the scandals that the Supreme Court has come out, that the Republicans [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=598.64s)]
*  are determined to blockade our efforts to investigate it, we're equally determined to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=604.76s)]
*  make sure we get to the bottom of it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  And getting those facts out there is going to be vital for the long-term credibility [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  of the court. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=617.24s)]
*  You have to get to solid wood before you start rebuilding, as any carpenter knows. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=618.24s)]
*  And at the same time, this challenged court has to go ahead and continue to be a court [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=624.12s)]
*  and continue to decide cases. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=628.68s)]
*  And I think they need to make sure that they're deciding these cases for real, following real [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=630.88s)]
*  rule of law, respecting precedent, and not turning into the captured court that many [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=636.24s)]
*  feel they have become. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=643.04s)]
*  Senator, I always, I think this is really important. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=644.88s)]
*  We're coming up on the three-year anniversary of January 6th. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=648.32s)]
*  You're an unruly mob of terrorists, I believe, under the guidance and being promoted by the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=652.68s)]
*  former president of the United States, attack the Capitol and threaten everybody's lives. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=658.68s)]
*  I'm not saying this for fictional purposes, but because I want the public to understand [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=662.52s)]
*  how dire and important these cases are. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  What do you think would have happened to our U.S. Congress? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=670.08s)]
*  What would have happened to Mike Pence or Joe Biden if Donald Trump had been successful [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=673.28s)]
*  on January 6th? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=677.12s)]
*  Well, clearly, hang Mike Pence was the champ that was echoing through the hallways of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=680.08s)]
*  Congress and men armed with weapons of a whole variety of kinds, including sharpened poles, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=687.92s)]
*  were smashing things and creating damage. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=699.68s)]
*  Many, many, many Capitol police officers and responding DC police officers were hurt. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=704.4000000000001s)]
*  Several deaths resulted, and their purpose was to undo the transfer of power. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=710.88s)]
*  Their purpose was to prevent American democracy from working. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=717.36s)]
*  So the idea that Trump is now defending himself as a champion of democracy and that these [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=722.96s)]
*  prosecutions shouldn't go forward for his effort to destroy democracy because he wants [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=727.7600000000001s)]
*  to be back on the ballot again, there's a terrible irony behind all of that. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=733.76s)]
*  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, thank you so much for starting us off tonight on All In. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=740.56s)]
*  Coming up, he's facing nearly a hundred felony charges and just battling to stay on the ballot. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=746.16s)]
*  What Trump's latest legal struggle means for his reelection and his freedom. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=751.84s)]
*  Next on All In. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=756.96s)]
*  Just hours ago, Donald Trump appealed the ruling by the main secretary of state that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=758.0s)]
*  kicked him off the ballot in that state, arguing that the secretary of state is, quote, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=767.12s)]
*  a biased decision maker who should have recused herself. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=771.44s)]
*  Trump also claims that the secretary of state has, quote, no legal authority under main statutes [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=775.04s)]
*  to consider the federal constitutional issues presented by the challengers, namely the 14th [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=780.64s)]
*  Amendment's ban on insurrectionists running for office. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  Last week on the night of the big ruling in Maine, the secretary of state joined me and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=790.0s)]
*  she laid out how she was duty bound under Maine election law to make a determination on Trump's [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=794.48s)]
*  eligibility. We lay out why under Maine law the secretary of state has the authority, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=799.84s)]
*  indeed the obligation, I'm duty bound to make this determination. And finally, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=807.44s)]
*  in reviewing the facts presented, the evidence, the law, the history, we determined under [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=813.36s)]
*  section three of the 14th Amendment that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection and therefore was [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=823.2s)]
*  disqualified. This all comes just over two weeks after the Colorado State Supreme Court came to [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=829.04s)]
*  the same conclusion, kicking Trump off the ballot in that state, too. In response, the Colorado [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=835.84s)]
*  Republican Party appealed the decision, and so we are now waiting to see if the United States [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=841.36s)]
*  Supreme Court will take up their appeal. We are also waiting for the ex-president to file his own [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=846.24s)]
*  appeal of the Colorado case. Right now, in addition to Colorado and Maine, 15 other states also have [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=851.12s)]
*  pending lawsuits to remove Trump from the ballot and go color. And two others, West Virginia, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  Arizona and green color, have pending appeals. Coming in to discuss all this is Andrew Weissman. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=864.08s)]
*  He spent years working in the Department of Justice, most recently as a lead prosecutor [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=870.4s)]
*  for special counsel Robert Mueller's team. Kristi Greenberg was deputy chief of the criminal [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=874.8s)]
*  division at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Both join me now. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=879.68s)]
*  Thank you so much. Andrew, I'll start with you. What do you think of Trump's appeal of the Maine [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=884.0799999999999s)]
*  ruling? And I say this for this reason. In theory, in sort of a high school civics brain, I can [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=891.36s)]
*  understand someone saying, hey, the secretary of state shouldn't be able to unilaterally make [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=897.92s)]
*  this decision. But by all accounts, it seems like she was following the law, and Trump is saying she [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  wasn't following the law. Yeah, I think the procedural attack on the secretary of state [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=908.4s)]
*  is completely misguided. Let's leave aside for the moment whether you agree or disagree with [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=914.8s)]
*  her decision, because she could have ruled the opposite way. The issue of what her authority is [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=921.44s)]
*  is absolutely clear under Maine law. The way the Maine law works is that initially the decision [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=929.7600000000001s)]
*  is made by the secretary of state as to whether somebody is qualified, just as if they were under [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  35 years old. If there was a teenager running for office, the secretary of state would make a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=946.56s)]
*  decision about whether that person should be on the ballot. But as the secretary of state put in [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=952.8s)]
*  her decision, she is not the last word. She makes a decision. She then very responsibly stayed her [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=959.68s)]
*  decision and noted to the parties their appellate rights. They can appeal to the Maine courts to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  determine whether she has abused her discretion, whether she has abused the law in any way, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=975.6s)]
*  and then ultimately either party that can try to go to the United States Supreme Court. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=982.48s)]
*  So procedurally, she did all the right things. And I would note she also held a hearing. She [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=988.72s)]
*  gave both sides an opportunity to be heard, to present witnesses, to put in exhibits, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=994.88s)]
*  to make objections. All of that was done. So she followed the Maine law to the letter. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1001.52s)]
*  Now, to be fair, both sides could appeal the decision to the courts, and that's what we're [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1008.4s)]
*  seeing now. So it's wrong to characterize this as, oh, the secretary of state is the only person [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1013.28s)]
*  who is unilaterally making a decision. That is the way Maine has structured sort of the initial [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1019.52s)]
*  decision, but that's not the final word. You know, Kristi, it seems like this is going to be [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1027.04s)]
*  the new frontier of legal battles. You know, for the last 10 or 15 years, we've been arguing about [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  voting rights. Who can vote when, where? Now it's arguments about who's on the ballot. We've got a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1040.0s)]
*  recent case coming up in Pennsylvania where you have an organizer who has filed to the state seeking [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1045.04s)]
*  to have Scott Perry disqualified from the ballot under the 14th Amendment. Now, look, if your concern [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1051.2s)]
*  is to take Republican members of Congress who aided and abetted and voted against holding Trump [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1057.76s)]
*  accountable, if you want to knock all them off the ballot, there's lots of them. Do you think this is [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1064.32s)]
*  an effective strategy? Do you think this is going to work anywhere? I think this is the Colorado [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1068.24s)]
*  decision is going to be heard by the Supreme Court. I think it will be heard quickly. We just saw the [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  Colorado Secretary of State petition as well as the Colorado Republican Party for the Supreme Court [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1081.04s)]
*  to take this up and to take it up quickly. And I believe they will do so because there is an interest [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1087.52s)]
*  in having some adjudication on this question. What will the Supreme Court do? I don't think they're [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1092.8s)]
*  going to find that the presidency is not in office of the United States and that Donald Trump did not [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1100.48s)]
*  take an oath to support the Constitution. I don't think they'll do that. But I, and I also don't [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1105.44s)]
*  think they're going to necessarily get into the substance of the fact-finding, whether he engaged [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1110.32s)]
*  in an insurrection or whether he gave aid or comfort to those who did. I don't think they're [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1114.96s)]
*  going to really seek to change the system, which really allows each state to have its own comprehensive [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1120.48s)]
*  election code to determine who gets access to the ballot. I think what you're going to see from the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1126.3999999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court is a very narrow holding. Think back to Bush v. Gore, those words in their opinion [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  where it said, our consideration is limited to the present circumstances. I think you'll see [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1137.8400000000001s)]
*  something similar here where the Colorado election code, the Supreme Court may say, that [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1143.2s)]
*  conservative majority may say, is just not equipped to handle the kind of complex factual case about [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1148.96s)]
*  whether or not a candidate engaged in an insurrection, have a very, very narrow holding that applies to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1155.68s)]
*  Donald Trump and doesn't upend the system. And ultimately, is that correct on this set of facts? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1162.0s)]
*  A due process argument is hard because in Maine, for example, Donald Trump had the opportunity to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1167.68s)]
*  call witnesses. He didn't, he didn't even move to have his exhibits in before the hearing. He didn't [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1173.12s)]
*  have them admitted into evidence. So he doesn't have great, it's not a great factual basis to claim [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1178.24s)]
*  due process problems, but I do think that's probably the easiest off-ramp for this Supreme Court. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1184.0s)]
*  And I just don't see this Supreme Court, the conservative majority here, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1190.08s)]
*  disqualifying Donald Trump from the ballot. I think they will view it as too drastic and [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  tipping the scales and I just don't see it happening. Now, Kristi, I wanted to make sure [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1198.72s)]
*  that I was clarifying this question real quickly. I was talking about what was happening in Pennsylvania [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1203.84s)]
*  where you have citizens trying to remove congressional candidates. Do you think, look, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1209.1999999999998s)]
*  if the big fish, if you can't catch the kingpin, do you think that attempts to not congressional [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1214.48s)]
*  candidates off the ballot might be effective if they are perceived to have been a part of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1218.72s)]
*  the insurrection as well? So look, there can be attempts to do that, but I think ultimately, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  if the Supreme Court is deciding that these issues under section three of the 14th amendment [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1228.8s)]
*  as to whether or not somebody engaged in an insurrection or assisted in them in doing so, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1234.8s)]
*  if those issues are decided by the Supreme Court, it would necessarily affect these other challenges [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1239.76s)]
*  as well. And I think that's why the Supreme Court of the United States will take this up to prevent [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1245.36s)]
*  exactly what you were talking about from happening. Andrew, very quickly, I've got to ask this [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1249.9199999999998s)]
*  question. Look, I'm a political science professor. I look at the entire planet. It galls me and every [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1255.6s)]
*  single time we're talking about Trump trials, this comes to mind. Last year, last year, July of 2023, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1260.56s)]
*  Brazil's Bolsonaro was barred from running for office until 3030. He lost election in 2022. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1267.12s)]
*  On January 8th, his right wing supporters went and attacked the Capitol. It took less than six [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1275.6799999999998s)]
*  months for the Brazilian Supreme Court to say, hey, this guy engaged in insurrection. Are we [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1281.4399999999998s)]
*  failing in this country that we're running up on almost the three year anniversary of January 6th [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1287.76s)]
*  and Trump isn't in jail and many members of Congress aren't in jail? When a country like [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1292.72s)]
*  Brazil that arguably we would mostly say that we think we have a stronger institutional democracy [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1296.72s)]
*  than they do, they seem to have handled this in six months. I love people who look at this [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1301.52s)]
*  from an international perspective because Americans are so parochial. We always think of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1308.32s)]
*  American exceptionalism. And obviously this is a great country, but we are not the first country [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1313.44s)]
*  on the globe who has had to deal with allegations that a former leader has engaged in high crimes. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1320.72s)]
*  That has happened in so-called first world countries and third world countries. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  Other countries have dealt with this with much more alacrity, providing due process [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1339.2s)]
*  and taking action. One final note on that is Jack Smith, remember, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1346.32s)]
*  served in the International Criminal Court. I think he is just so perfectly placed to understand [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1353.52s)]
*  the place in history and the place on the globe that this trial that he is spearheading has in [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1362.56s)]
*  terms of the importance to America as it's seen globally. Andrew Reisman and [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1370.72s)]
*  Kristi Greenberg, thank you so much for joining me this evening. Welcome. Still ahead, the [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1380.56s)]
*  quadruply indicted ex-president spews another series of nonsensical claims on social media. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1387.1200000000001s)]
*  But what if his ridiculous claims are actually on purpose? Next on All In. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1392.8s)]
*  Today, the ex-president who faces four indictments on 91 felony charges [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1400.72s)]
*  released what he calls a quote, summary of election fraud in the 2020 election. The document [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1408.24s)]
*  makes one false claim after another, starting off with this one that quote, it has often been [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1413.84s)]
*  repeated. There is no evidence of a fraud in the 2020 election. In actuality, there is no evidence [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1419.1200000000001s)]
*  that Joe Biden won. And it just goes downhill from there, including with the false insertion [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1425.52s)]
*  that in the battleground states, quote, hundreds of thousands of votes were altered and or not [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1431.76s)]
*  lawfully cast in the presidential election. But even if none of his claims make sense, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1436.72s)]
*  it's beside the point because Trump's real purpose is just kind of flood the zone with [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1442.4s)]
*  misinformation. So just by releasing the so-called report, he's already doing damage. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1446.56s)]
*  I'm here to discuss is Rick Hanson. He's a professor of law and political science at UCLA, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1452.16s)]
*  where he is also the director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project. Thank you so much, professor. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1457.52s)]
*  He has a new book coming out next month, A Real Right to Vote, How a Constitutional Amendment [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1463.04s)]
*  Can Safeguard American Democracy. And he joins me now. Thank you so much, Rick Hanson. Look, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1468.72s)]
*  I'll start with this. You know, Trump is releasing this report. He says it proves [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1474.0s)]
*  that he's innocent. But let's just be practical here. He didn't read this report. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1481.52s)]
*  Nobody on his staff read this report. Nobody who believes that the 2020 election was rigged or [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1486.1599999999999s)]
*  stolen is going to read this report. So what's the purpose of a document like this? Because I [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1491.36s)]
*  don't know that anybody except us here in order to criticize it are actually going to read this thing. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1496.8s)]
*  Well, I think that that is exactly right. The purpose of this is to provide some kind of veneer [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1503.52s)]
*  that there's evidence that supports this case. You may remember that Trump brought something like [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1511.04s)]
*  62 lawsuits in the period after the election, claiming fraud. And this is probably the most [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1517.44s)]
*  investigated election we've had in U.S. history. And there is really no evidence of any kind of [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1523.36s)]
*  systematic fraud or regularities. But that doesn't matter because Trump says that he's [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1531.2s)]
*  convinced his supporters that everyone else is out to get him, the deep state. Everyone is trying to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1537.1200000000001s)]
*  manipulate the facts. And so he doesn't need to put out real evidence. He just needs to put out [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1544.0s)]
*  something like this with some bullet points of discredited arguments. And that's enough for many [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1548.8s)]
*  of his supporters to believe, you know, it's been proven, the election's been stolen. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1553.8400000000001s)]
*  Professor Hassan, you know, there's an op-ed that just came out in USA Today as an opinion piece. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1558.0s)]
*  It was written by Ken Block. And his data mining firm was hired by the Trump campaign to find [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1564.96s)]
*  evidence of voter fraud. And he says, quote, Trump paid me to find voter fraud. Then he lied [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1571.12s)]
*  after I found the 2020 election wasn't stolen. Professor, it's one thing for Trump to release [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1575.84s)]
*  a phony report or for Trump to continue to lie or for moderate Republicans to continue to lie. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1583.52s)]
*  But when the guy he hired to find evidence of election fraud can't find any election fraud, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1589.04s)]
*  what does that say about, you know, not just the credibility of Trump, but perhaps even the [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1596.08s)]
*  Republicans as a whole? I mean, they've banked this on people who are repudiating their own [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1600.96s)]
*  claims at every single step. Well, I think, you know, it speaks to the lack of need for [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1606.56s)]
*  actual evidence. This, you have to ask, what is the point of these lies? And I think the point of [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  these lies is multifold. First, it's meant to explain a Trump loss. You know, why, how could [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1619.36s)]
*  he have lost to Joe Biden, of all people who he's excoriated, because there was fraud. It also serves [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1625.84s)]
*  delegitimize democratic victories and makes it easier to attack whatever it is that the current [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1632.48s)]
*  administration is doing by claiming that they're somehow illegitimate. In this way, it's kind of [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1637.76s)]
*  like the birther controversy back with President Obama, that he's not a legitimate president. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1642.56s)]
*  And third, I think it's laying the groundwork for 2024 and arguments that if Trump loses, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1648.4s)]
*  yet again, it's because of fraud, whether that's to protect his ego or whether it's more nefariously [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1654.4s)]
*  to try to manipulate the outcome of the 2024 elections. The whole idea is to create doubt [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1660.4s)]
*  and undermine legitimacy of the current system of democratic government. And that really is [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1667.92s)]
*  dangerous for our democracy. Professor to professor here, I have struggled with watching [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1673.0400000000002s)]
*  organizers and activists trying to remove a candidate from the ballot, because just in my [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1682.48s)]
*  political science core, I'm like, no, this should be up to the voters. But we are in this unique [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1687.36s)]
*  circumstance where we have a former president who has consistently attempted to foment violent [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1691.76s)]
*  insurrection. What's your thought sort of just philosophically and practically about what we've [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1697.12s)]
*  seen in Colorado and what we've seen about Maine, about organizers on the ground attempting to keep [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1702.24s)]
*  Trump off the ballot because he violated the 14th Amendment and gave aid and comfort to people who [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1708.08s)]
*  are engaging in insurrection? I'm really conflicted on this. On the one hand, there's a part of the [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1713.04s)]
*  Constitution that says that if you've participated in insurrection or supported American enemies, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1718.48s)]
*  you're disqualified from running. On the other hand, it makes me a little queasy. There are so [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1723.6s)]
*  many unanswered questions. How are we supposed to resolve this? Who is going to resolve this? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1729.52s)]
*  It creates conditions for great political instability. Maybe the Supreme Court is going [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1736.24s)]
*  to give us something definitive over the next weeks or months. If not, this is going to hang [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1741.6s)]
*  over the election. What does it mean for voters who don't know if the candidate they're voting for [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1745.84s)]
*  is entitled to serve in office? The legal questions are difficult. The factual questions [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1750.56s)]
*  are at least disputed. Procedurally, we're not sure how we're supposed to go. It's really bad when [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1758.0s)]
*  you've got these crucial issues and they're being determined not in some low-level contest, but in [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1763.4399999999998s)]

*  Now, here's the thing. If Harvard decided that it no longer wanted Claudine Gay as its president, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1908.5600000000002s)]

*  the Harvard Foundation gave Gay their support. It is disappointing that Harvard has bowed to [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1923.04s)]
*  right-wing pressure. Conservatives are obsessed with elite colleges. They're like writers from [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1929.3600000000001s)]

*  America is filled with brilliant, qualified people out of Michigan State and University of [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1945.04s)]
*  Akron and Spelman and Emory and UC Santa Barbara. If Republicans really cared about what's happening [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1949.6s)]
*  on America's campuses, they'd look into the schools where 95 percent of Americans actually go. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1955.1999999999998s)]

*  100 years ago. To paraphrase, he said, quote, Harvard has ruined more Negro minds than bad [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1985.76s)]
*  liquor. Harvard has obviously improved since then, and it may not have ruined Claudia Ngeye's mind, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1992.72s)]
*  but they have definitely damaged her career by doing the bidding of the American right. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=1999.68s)]
*  Hopefully, other colleges will stand more firm in the future. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2004.32s)]
*  We are less than two weeks away from the Iowa caucuses and three weeks from New Hampshire [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2010.8s)]
*  primaries, which together kick off the 2024 presidential cycle in earnest. New polling shows [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2015.84s)]
*  Nikki Haley on the rise, breaking into double digits nationally and rocketing up in New Hampshire. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2021.84s)]
*  You can see the pink line jumping within striking distance of Donald Trump, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2027.12s)]
*  clearly an alarming development for Trump's camp. The ex-president has taken to insulting Haley, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2031.28s)]
*  calling her bird brain. Haley is taking shots at DeSantis, and Chris Christie is [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2037.04s)]
*  pretty much going after everybody. Nikki Haley promised, I will not, not now, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2041.6799999999998s)]
*  not ever support raising the gas tax. Really? Not now? Not ever? Ron DeSantis is lying because [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2048.88s)]
*  he's losing. DeSantis called China Florida's most important trading partner. DeSantis even allowed a [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2057.28s)]
*  Chinese military contractor to expand just miles from a U.S. naval base. Only Ron DeSantis. Too [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2063.76s)]
*  lame to leave, too weak to win. He calls the riot on Capitol Hill, he'll burn America to the ground [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2071.2000000000003s)]
*  to help himself. Every Republican leader says that in private. I'm the only one saying it in [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2076.96s)]
*  public. What kind of president do we want? A liar or someone who's got the guts to tell the truth? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  New Hampshire, it's up to you. Brendan Buck is a Republican strategist who served as press secretary [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2088.8s)]
*  of vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in 2012. Jennifer Horn is the former chair of the New [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2097.12s)]
*  Hampshire Republican Party. They join me now. I'll start with you, Brendan. This is what's [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2102.16s)]
*  interesting to me when I'm looking at these numbers. I see Nikki Haley improving. I see [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2109.6s)]
*  Chris Christie continuing to take shots at everybody. I see Ron DeSantis sort of fading. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2116.0s)]
*  Is all of this just sort of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic? Is there any chance, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2121.2s)]
*  not just that somebody beats Donald Trump for the nomination, do you think there's any chance that [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2126.56s)]
*  he doesn't just sweep all the primaries? I think it's a very good bet that he's [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2131.28s)]
*  going to sweep all the primaries. I'll let Jennifer talk about New Hampshire. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2136.5600000000004s)]
*  But it is notable that Nikki Haley is close. That is the closest we've seen anybody. Now, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2140.88s)]
*  is that enough to win? No. But I do think that it is, we need to remember that Nikki Haley's [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2146.0s)]
*  rise here has gone with Donald Trump largely ignoring her. And it seems that he's no longer [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2152.0s)]
*  going to be doing that. And I think we need to appreciate that Donald Trump is more than capable [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2158.24s)]
*  of knocking out Nikki Haley in the same way that he did to Ron DeSantis. I mean, Ron DeSantis was [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2162.3999999999996s)]
*  pretty close, if not ahead of Donald Trump in some polls at the beginning of this year. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2168.4799999999996s)]
*  And his slip was two things. One, it was just, he proved to be a bad candidate. But the second was [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2173.4399999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump came out pummeling Ron DeSantis and DeSantis didn't know how to respond. So if [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2178.64s)]
*  Donald Trump turns on Nikki Haley now and really starts taking shots at her, I think he'll be able [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2182.9599999999996s)]
*  to very easily clear that and this primary will be over very, very quickly. Jennifer, I have to ask [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2187.76s)]
*  you, as former head of the party in New Hampshire, sometimes New Hampshire voters, they like to be [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2193.92s)]
*  contrarian. Sometimes they see what happens in Iowa and they're like, well, you know what, I'm, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2200.1600000000003s)]
*  I want to do something different just to keep this, keep this spicy and interesting. Do you think that [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2203.84s)]
*  that is a possibility? Do you think if Donald Trump just, just basically runs circles around everybody [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2208.5600000000004s)]
*  in Iowa, that New Hampshire Republican voters may say, hold on, we're going to put our support [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2214.8s)]
*  behind Nikki Haley or Chris Christie? Or do you think that a successful caucus for Donald Trump [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2219.52s)]
*  and Iowa will pretty much mean that everybody will get in line in New Hampshire? I don't see that. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2225.6000000000004s)]
*  And I would take charge, I think, with the idea of New Hampshire voters exactly being contrarian, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  but more, more independent thinking is how I used to, used to think of us. But what I, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2238.8799999999997s)]
*  what I see in New Hampshire, honestly, is that Donald Trump's support has been deep and broad, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2244.96s)]
*  both, and that it has been consistent. And while Nikki Haley has been able to sort of creep up [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2250.48s)]
*  closer and closer, remember that that really happened and supported in great part by the [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2256.48s)]
*  spending, millions and millions of dollars of spending by Americans for prosperity [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2263.52s)]
*  over the last month. And now that she is getting closer, you know, as to the previous point, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2267.6s)]
*  Trump has the ability to just crush her if he wants to in New Hampshire. I think, you know, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2272.96s)]
*  the bet, I think somebody just referenced that she was within striking, you know, within striking [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2280.32s)]
*  distance. I don't necessarily really agree with that. I don't think she's quite there yet. If [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2285.92s)]
*  she gets down within single digits, then she's within striking distance. But I think Donald Trump [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2289.84s)]
*  has himself perfectly positioned still in spite of her rise. I think he's going to win New Hampshire. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2296.08s)]
*  I think he's going to continue to win after that. And then what I really think is the interesting [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2302.1600000000003s)]
*  question, you know, is going to be at what point does the RNC step in and publicly suggest that [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2308.0s)]
*  everybody else to get out of the way? I think that they will eventually come in and ask Nikki [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2316.24s)]
*  Haley to step aside. You know, Brendan cynically, you know, in previous election seasons, 2012, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2320.56s)]
*  you know, 2016, where they're usually as somebody who's a really, really strong candidate, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2329.04s)]
*  a lot of times political commentators, analysts will say, well, you know what, these people are [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2333.52s)]
*  just running for vice president. Given how Donald Trump treated his last vice president and his [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2336.9599999999996s)]
*  supporters threatened his last vice president, do you think there is anyone in the current [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2342.4s)]
*  Republican field who has that delusion? Is Nikki Haley thinking to herself, well, you know what, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2347.04s)]
*  I, you know, I might miss the moon, but I'll be amongst the stars. Donald Trump will pick me. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2352.64s)]
*  I know Chris Christie couldn't have that idea. Are there any Republicans now who think that that's [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2356.56s)]
*  their opportunity or are they still really running because they either think that Trump will stumble [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2361.12s)]
*  or maybe they'll have a chance to raise some more money? Yeah, I think at this point, you know, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2365.52s)]
*  Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, the two more serious people are really just running to save face. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2370.56s)]
*  I think Nikki Haley is hoping that she can have a strong second. And if Donald Trump loses in a [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2375.44s)]
*  general election, she is potentially still viable and kind of say, I told you so. I think Ron [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2380.08s)]
*  DeSantis is trying to salvage something of his future. I mean, the shine has completely come off [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2384.64s)]
*  of Ron DeSantis. And if he comes in third in Iowa, after spending so much time there, it has to [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2390.88s)]
*  basically drop out in shame. His future may be done. I think he sees himself as, if not this time, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2396.48s)]
*  I still need to be able to run in the future. I'm sure Nikki Haley the same. So they're trying to [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2402.32s)]
*  save their future, I think at this point more than anything. Jennifer, very quickly, we've talked [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2406.8s)]
*  about this earlier in the show. There is just a litany of court cases that Donald Trump is going [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2413.2s)]
*  to have to face heading into primary season. Do you think that has any impact at all that there [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2418.56s)]
*  may actually be some super Tuesday states that he doesn't necessarily have as much time to campaign [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2424.0s)]
*  in because he's going to be in court? Will that make any difference one way or another? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2428.8s)]
*  I really don't think it will in the end. Donald Trump doesn't need to campaign in person the way [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2433.28s)]
*  all the other candidates do. And we've seen time after time after time that the more indictments [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2437.2s)]
*  he faces, the more legal trouble he faces, the deeper that his support grows amongst most [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2445.52s)]
*  Republican voters. They believe that Donald Trump is a symbol for themselves and their party, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2453.2s)]
*  that he's being attacked is somehow an attack on them. And as long as, yes, I really don't [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2459.04s)]
*  think it's going to impact the outcome of this race. Brendan Buck and Jennifer Horn, thank you [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2467.12s)]
*  so much for joining us on All In tonight. That's All In on this Tuesday night. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIfr0iDIU0w&t=2474.3999999999996s)]
