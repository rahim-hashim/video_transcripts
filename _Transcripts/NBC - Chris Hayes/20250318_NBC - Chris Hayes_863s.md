# See Schumer confronted with AOC, Pelosi, Jeffries criticism on MSNBC I Primetime Exclusive
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4)
*  The last time I had you on Friday was on the day of the shutdown being averted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=0.0s)]
*  And you came on the program, you said why you thought it was important. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=5.2s)]
*  And since then, we've had this enormous backlash. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=8.28s)]
*  And obviously, you're in politics a long time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=12.24s)]
*  You understand this comes to the territory. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=14.18s)]
*  Has it made you rethink anything? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=16.48s)]
*  No. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=19.52s)]
*  Look, I knew when I made this decision I'd get a lot of flak. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=20.52s)]
*  I'm a smart politician. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=24.88s)]
*  I can read what people want. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=26.2s)]
*  But I thought even though the CR was a terrible, terrible bill and would allow within the CR, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=28.22s)]
*  the administration to move things around, I thought a shutdown was so much worse, 20 [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=34.54s)]
*  times worse. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=38.98s)]
*  And let me explain why so people understand it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=39.98s)]
*  Under a shutdown, the executive branch has absolute power to determine what is, quote, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=42.62s)]
*  essential. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  They have the sole power. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=49.22s)]
*  Court rulings have said the courts have no say. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=50.46s)]
*  Now under normal time, if it was a shutdown, okay, it'd be a Republican government. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=52.86s)]
*  They do that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=56.42s)]
*  You have these fanatics, these anti-government, vicious nihilists in charge. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=57.42s)]
*  They can say anything. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=63.38s)]
*  Anything is not essential. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=65.26s)]
*  So it could have been today if we were in the shutdown, they said, feeding hungry children? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=66.58s)]
*  Not essential. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=71.12s)]
*  Eliminate SNAP. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=72.12s)]
*  Two days from now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=73.12s)]
*  The only thing we need in transportation are air traffic controllers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=74.18s)]
*  Cut off all mass transit funding to New York and the other cities of the country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=77.58s)]
*  All transit funding. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  Day six, Medicaid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=84.82000000000001s)]
*  They could cut off Medicaid almost totally. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=86.86s)]
*  So within two weeks, they could just so decimate the federal government, almost throwing a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=90.38s)]
*  bomb at it, that we could never recover. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=96.42s)]
*  And wait, one more thing that's worse. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=99.18s)]
*  There's no exit ramp. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=101.22s)]
*  In other words, how do you get out of the shutdown? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=102.22s)]
*  Solely up to the executive branch. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=104.82s)]
*  And one Republican senator who's close to these horrible Doge Musk people said that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=107.02s)]
*  They expected to close it down for six months, nine months, till the whole federal government [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=114.22s)]
*  was obliterated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=118.54s)]
*  Musk's dream, to get $2 trillion out of the federal government, could happen under a shutdown. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=119.9s)]
*  So I felt the very people who are upset now, if we went through with the shutdown and all [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=126.9s)]
*  these things happened, would be coming two, three weeks later and saying, get it open, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=131.38s)]
*  get SNAP open, get mass transit open. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=135.18s)]
*  I'd say, well, it's a shutdown. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=137.38s)]
*  We can't. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=138.76s)]
*  They said, well, why'd you let that happen? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=139.76s)]
*  So one more thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=140.9s)]
*  I knew I'd take a lot of flak. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=142.34s)]
*  But you know, when you're a leader, sometimes you have to do things that you know are right, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  despite the consequences. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  I've always said to people in politics, the higher up you climb, the more fierce the winds [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  blow. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=155.5s)]
*  The only thing that keeps you from being blown off course is your internal gyroscope. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=156.86s)]
*  That's what I used. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=161.62s)]
*  So I take that seriously, that catastrophic nature. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=162.9s)]
*  I thought so long and hard about it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  But here's, let me just, I want to sort of pivot it a little to a more of a tactical [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=168.94s)]
*  decision because there was something that happened here that doesn't normally happen, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=173.18s)]
*  which is they knew they needed Democratic votes and they cut you out entirely. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=176.02s)]
*  Entirely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=179.9s)]
*  Now, when that has happened before, Republicans have filibustered successfully and forced [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=180.9s)]
*  Democrats to the table. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=185.9s)]
*  And so just purely at the level of how the tactics brought us to this point, I want to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=186.9s)]
*  play some of the criticism again, not from like backseat drivers or not from me on cable [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=191.62s)]
*  news, but people like Khakim Jeffries or Nancy Pelosi. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=195.94s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=198.46s)]
*  Look, Chuck and I disagreed as it relates to the approach and outcome. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=205.94s)]
*  And this is not just about progressive Democrats. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  This is across the board, the entire party. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=212.02s)]
*  I still support Senator Schumer as leader, but I think the only way that we are going [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=214.38000000000002s)]
*  to be effective as a caucus is if we change our tactics. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=219.66000000000003s)]
*  I would have liked to see when Chuck Schumer had leverage here to say we need A, B, C and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=223.62s)]
*  D for the Democratic Party and force the Republicans to meet him halfway on those issues. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  I myself don't give away anything for nothing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=236.46s)]
*  And I think that's what happened the other day. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=240.62s)]
*  They said, OK, he said leverage. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=244.10000000000002s)]
*  I think it was the governor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=245.78s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi said I myself don't give away anything for nothing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=246.78s)]
*  I think that's what happened. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  The only leverage we had. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  They weren't going to negotiate with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  So there were two choices only. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=253.5s)]
*  It would be nice if we had a third choice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  We tried to get that third choice with the 30-day extension that Patty Murray tried to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=257.32s)]
*  get some moderate, more moderate Republicans on the Appropriations Committee go along. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=261.98s)]
*  They wouldn't. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=266.46s)]
*  So we were faced only, only the Senate, not the House. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=267.46s)]
*  They had a little easier because they could vote no against the CR and not cause a shutdown. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=270.62s)]
*  But in the Senate, the only two choices were these choices, period. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=274.7s)]
*  And the choice of the shutdown was so severe, you're giving them the keys to the city. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=278.74s)]
*  Why would we? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=284.5s)]
*  Look, this guy, the worst of them all, is this guy who's head of OMB named Vote, V-O-U-G-H-T, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=285.5s)]
*  but people hear the word vote. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  He already has a plan to shut down a large church. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  He's doing it right now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=296.38s)]
*  No, he cannot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=297.38s)]
*  Now, if you don't have a shutdown, you can go to court. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=298.38s)]
*  And we've had some successful results in the courts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  A lot of the judges we put in, Chris, you know, the 235, we've won about 85% of the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=304.1s)]
*  cases. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=309.18s)]
*  Shutdown, no court, they make the decision, and they can make it quickly, easily, and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=310.18s)]
*  across the whole federal government, not just the things that were in the CR. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  But here's to me my understanding of the critique that's broader than the specifics here, which [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=318.82000000000005s)]
*  is about the level and depth of crisis we're in and the appropriate tactics to meet them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=323.74s)]
*  And so what I think people think is, first of all, we all know the Senate functions on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=330.42s)]
*  unanimous consent. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=333.5s)]
*  It's how anything happens. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=334.5s)]
*  We've watched real pains in the butt. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=335.94s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville basically bring the place to a halt just denying unanimous consent because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=338.7s)]
*  he was mad the Department of Defense might somewhere pay for a portion, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=343.94s)]
*  The idea of how cataclysmic that shutdown, I hear what you're saying. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=348.38s)]
*  But what I'm hearing from people, and there's a lot of them, is right now a crisis is happening [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=352.46s)]
*  unlike anything the republic has faced maybe since even the Civil War. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=357.82s)]
*  Most Americans don't quite grasp it, and it's your job as the most powerful democrat [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=362.84s)]
*  to use whatever tactics you have to communicate that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=369.0s)]
*  And by going along with this, you have missed this opportunity to tell the nation just how [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  bad it is. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=379.28s)]
*  There's only one choice to going along with it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=380.28s)]
*  Shut down. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=383.08s)]
*  This, we have to pick the fights, and I want to fight Trump as much as anybody and stop [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=384.08s)]
*  him and not give Republicans sucker help. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=388.94s)]
*  But in this situation, there was no... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=392.9s)]
*  But doesn't it call the question? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=394.9s)]
*  Doesn't the crisis create the attentional vortex that is necessary? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=396.9s)]
*  Because right now, people have no idea that they're going to basically get rid of all [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=400.74s)]
*  of American universities and all of American science funding. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=404.86s)]
*  We try to communicate it every night, but there's nothing like a crisis to drive that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=408.38s)]
*  home. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=412.38s)]
*  But the drama of the shutdown, eliminating all of these things would do such damage, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=413.38s)]
*  such damage... [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=418.9s)]
*  Substantively. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=419.9s)]
*  ...that I couldn't tolerate it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=421.14s)]
*  I couldn't live with it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  You know, I know there's the idea that, okay, people will... [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  They will sit and negotiate with us because they're doing bad things. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=428.06s)]
*  That ain't these Republicans. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=432.06s)]
*  They wouldn't sit with us for nothing because their overall goal... [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=433.64s)]
*  Look, the Republican Party is a new party. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=437.14s)]
*  It's controlled by these mega right billionaires. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=440.14s)]
*  They want two things. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=444.29999999999995s)]
*  They want to pay no taxes, so get rid of all the spending, even if it's... [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I was up today... [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=449.38s)]
*  We had a Medicare Day of Action, Hakeem and I, and senators and congressmen went and talked [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=450.9s)]
*  about Medicaid. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=455.14s)]
*  I went up to Montefiore Hospital, which covers all the Bronx. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=456.3s)]
*  It's the only cancer center in the whole Bronx. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=461.38s)]
*  80%... [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=463.58s)]
*  I grew up a block from Montefiore Hospital. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=464.58s)]
*  There you go. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=466.18s)]
*  Well, 80% of the people there are Medicare and Medicaid, and they're the only cancer [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=467.18s)]
*  treatment. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=471.74s)]
*  If they cut Medicaid by 20%, children would die. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=473.06s)]
*  Children would die. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=478.02s)]
*  That's what would happen with a shutdown. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=479.62s)]
*  You say, have leverage. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=482.29999999999995s)]
*  We should, but in this case, the choice given to us, because they couldn't... [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=483.82s)]
*  I don't blame them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=490.06s)]
*  They wouldn't negotiate with the Democrats because they had all the votes, because Trump [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=491.38s)]
*  is such a hammer, gave us only two choices. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=495.41999999999996s)]
*  There was not a third choice. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  The question is, these people won't negotiate. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=501.18s)]
*  This was the one opportunity for leverage because of the need for a filibuster role [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=503.26s)]
*  proof majority. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=507.74s)]
*  They're not going to have that on reconciliation. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=509.18s)]
*  They're going to have it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=510.78s)]
*  There are going to be other opportunities. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=512.14s)]
*  Because what people hear is like, we're going to lie in the cut until they self-destruct. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=515.06s)]
*  No. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=518.58s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=519.58s)]
*  What's the plan? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=520.58s)]
*  But then what is the strategic plan? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=521.58s)]
*  Okay, here is the plan. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=522.58s)]
*  Here's what we're doing right now. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=523.58s)]
*  Okay? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=524.58s)]
*  There are two things I want to say. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=525.58s)]
*  One, every day we are hammering away at Trump, and we have a simple, simple thought that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=527.9s)]
*  unites the Democratic Party from one end to the other. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=535.14s)]
*  He's asking the middle class to pay for tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=538.46s)]
*  It unites us all. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=542.46s)]
*  Bernie Sanders likes it, and my most conservative members like it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=543.46s)]
*  We're hammering away at that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=546.46s)]
*  Today it was Medicaid. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=547.7s)]
*  Tomorrow it's going to be, in the next few days, it's going to be tariffs. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=548.7s)]
*  He's raising those tariffs, raising your cost, Mr. and Mrs. American, by $2,000 a year if [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=551.4200000000001s)]
*  he raises all these tariffs, so that he can use that money for tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=556.58s)]
*  He's cutting your education funds in so your kids don't get a great education, and your [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=561.84s)]
*  school taxes will go up for that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=565.52s)]
*  So we have started doing this day in, day out, every day, fighting relentlessly. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  His numbers have started to go down from 51 to 47. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=572.94s)]
*  If we keep at it and keep at it and keep at it, his numbers will be much lower. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=576.48s)]
*  He will not only be less popular but less effective. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=581.24s)]
*  Second, we will find the moments where we shouldn't give them votes. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=584.08s)]
*  Hakeem and I met yesterday. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=589.52s)]
*  We're exploring that right now. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=591.2399999999999s)]
*  There will be times, just like this instance, where people will say, don't give them the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=592.88s)]
*  votes because you have the leverage. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=596.76s)]
*  There will be instances, not like this, where a shutdown would ensue, but where we will [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=599.28s)]
*  have the higher ground. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=604.6199999999999s)]
*  We're going to do it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=605.6199999999999s)]
*  Watch us. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=606.6199999999999s)]
*  Okay, but here's what I would say in response to that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=607.6199999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm channeling people as much as I can. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=609.52s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  Hey, this is a democracy still. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=613.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's hope it stays. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  Here's what I'm saying. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  All of those things you enumerated, which all sound like good politics to me, are the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  kinds of things that you'd be doing if Mitt Romney were president. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=621.2800000000001s)]
*  There's this weird asymmetry right now, which is that they are acting in this totally new [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  way in which they are ambitiously trying to seize all power and create a presidential [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=629.08s)]
*  dictatorship in the United States of America. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=634.0400000000001s)]
*  The Democratic opposition is acting like, well, if we can get their poor rate down a [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=636.48s)]
*  few points, then what? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=641.12s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=642.12s)]
*  Well, what happens is, look, first, we get it way down. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=643.16s)]
*  He's going to have much less. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=646.8s)]
*  This worked in 2017. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=648.28s)]
*  You say, now it's a different government. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=649.28s)]
*  It's different, though. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=651.6s)]
*  Oh, it is different. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=652.6s)]
*  My God. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=653.6s)]
*  But health care, we beat them. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=654.6s)]
*  Taxes, we beat them. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=655.8s)]
*  And guess what we did? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=657.04s)]
*  Guess what we did, Chris? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=658.04s)]
*  We took back the House and won in the Senate, and then we were allowed to do all those good [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=659.04s)]
*  things. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  This is not the only tactic. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  We have to stand strong in certain instances and not give them the votes at all. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=665.6s)]
*  But there are instances where the two work together. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=670.52s)]
*  OK, again, I don't disagree with any of that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=672.92s)]
*  But the difference to me between 2017 and now, and I've been at this desk for both of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=675.5999999999999s)]
*  us, it is a full-fledged assault on the constitutional order that has not been seen again. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, that is true. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  But the question then becomes— [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  That's not the spending part. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=689.0799999999999s)]
*  That isn't. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=690.8s)]
*  But then the question becomes, what is the role of the minority in resisting that that's [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=691.8s)]
*  distinct from, we're going to beat them on health care, we're going to beat them on spending [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=697.04s)]
*  Medicaid? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=700.28s)]
*  If our democracy is at risk— [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  It is at risk. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  It is certainly at risk. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, do you believe it is? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  But if— [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't want to put words in your mouth. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=708.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you believe it's at risk? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=709.76s)]
*  If Trump doesn't obey the Supreme Court, which may happen, you led up to it here, then we [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=710.76s)]
*  will have two courts. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  We will have the federal courts, which hopefully John Roberts will stand up and make it happen. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=719.3199999999999s)]
*  But we'll have the Court of Public Opinion. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=723.52s)]
*  And if that happens, as you pointed out, we have had rule of law since the Magna Carta. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=725.16s)]
*  Okay? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=730.48s)]
*  And if that happens, and the rule of law goes by the wayside, I believe that there will [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=731.48s)]
*  be very, very—you know, there will be immediate and strong reaction from one end of the country [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  to the other in ways that we have never seen. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=749.12s)]
*  And that's what will happen. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=752.3800000000001s)]
*  And it's not just up to us. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=753.84s)]
*  The people will have to rise up, not just Democrats, not just Republicans, not just, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=755.64s)]
*  you know, people—everybody. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=760.72s)]
*  But our democracy will be at stake then. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=762.88s)]
*  And if the people make their voices heard and are strong and stand up and we join them, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=765.5s)]
*  I believe we can try to beat that back. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=772.0s)]
*  We can beat that back. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=774.06s)]
*  But it's—on that one, if democracy is at risk, that's a little different than what [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=775.66s)]
*  we're talking about now. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=780.52s)]
*  I think actually this is useful because I do think, like, just in a—and again, in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=781.64s)]
*  a genuine sort of good-faith way, that there's a lot of people—and I think I probably count [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSiuunmuL4&t=791.0s)]
