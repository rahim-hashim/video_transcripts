Video Description: “Even amid a geopolitical crisis involving one of America's closest allies, the MAGA movement will first and foremost focus on what it really cares about: Making it easier for the yacht owners of America to commit tax fraud,” says Chris Hayes on House Republicans demanding IRS budget cuts as part of the Israel aid package.

# GOP speaker 'laser-focused' on helping yacht owners cheat on taxes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The United States Congress began this week with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=0.0s)]
*  speaker of the House and both of its chambers in session. The last time that was true, we were in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=4.32s)]
*  an entirely different world. Just remember, it was on October 3rd when a small group of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=9.28s)]
*  MAGA Republicans fired the last speaker, Kevin McCarthy, plunging the House into chaos. It was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=14.8s)]
*  just four days after that, on October 7th, that Hamas broke through the border between Gaza and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=20.48s)]
*  southern Israel and slaughtered 1,400 people in Israel, including men, women, children, and taking [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=25.84s)]
*  another 200-plus hostage. Israel then enacted a complete and total blockade in Gaza, cutting off [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=33.28s)]
*  basically all food, water, and fuel, three weeks of sustained airstrikes, and now a ground invasion, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=39.68s)]
*  all of which together have cost thousands upon thousands of civilian lives. The Gaza Health [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=45.84s)]
*  Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas but whose statistics have proven broadly accurate in prior [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=51.2s)]
*  conflicts, says the death toll in Gaza is over 8,500 people. Here at home, political battles are [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=56.720000000000006s)]
*  being waged over new military aid to Israel, along with additional aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=63.92s)]
*  against Russia, which President Biden has asked Congress to authorize. Now, something Congress was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  previously not able to do, as the House kind of didn't actually fully exist. It was in this liminal [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=76.08s)]
*  space with an interim speaker with no formal powers. It took three weeks for the Republican [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=82.0s)]
*  Conference to get its act together to finally elect a new speaker. But now that Louisiana Republican [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Mike Johnson has been sworn in, the House Republican majority is ready to govern. Speaker Johnson is [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  laser-focused on what really matters, the most important issue on the minds of the American people, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=98.96s)]
*  making it easier for rich people to cheat on their taxes. Not only does Johnson want to uncouple aid [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=103.84s)]
*  to Ukraine from the aid to Israel bill against the will of both the White House and the bipartisan [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=111.76s)]
*  consensus of the Senate, he is also demanding that any money for Israel be paired with cuts to the IRS [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  whose job it is to audit the very wealthy and make sure they are paying what they owe. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=125.04s)]
*  And while Johnson and his MAGA Confederates were referring to this plan as a way to offset the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=130.4s)]
*  spending, it's actually the opposite. Independent analysts, including the nonpartisan Congressional [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=134.64s)]
*  Budget Office, point out that gutting the IRS actually raises the deficit rather than lowers it, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=139.68s)]
*  because more funding for the IRS means more accountability for rich folks trying to avoid [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=146.32s)]
*  paying their fair share of taxes, which means, duh, more revenue for the government. Cutting [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=150.72s)]
*  that funding, meanwhile, means less revenue for the government and thus higher deficits. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=156.24s)]
*  It's expensive. Today, Speaker Johnson met with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=161.36s)]
*  who presumably made the White House's case for aid. Leaders of both parties in the Senate made [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=166.96s)]
*  it clear the Speaker's alternate plan was a total non-starter. The House GOP bill is woefully [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  inadequate and has the hard right's fingerprints all over it. It makes aid for Israel, who is just [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=179.84s)]
*  faced the worst terrorist attack in its history, contingent on poison pills that reward rich tax [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=186.08s)]
*  cheats. In short, it makes it much, much harder to pass aid for Israel. It's insulting that the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=192.96s)]
*  hard right is openly trying to exploit the crisis in Israel to try and reward the ultra-rich. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=201.84s)]
*  Well, let me just say that conceptually, conceptually, Senator Schumer and I are in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  the same place in the sense that we view all of these problems as connected. Ukraine [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  is part of it. Obviously, Israel enjoys overwhelming support, but we think it's also [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=227.2s)]
*  important that we have a part related to Asia, and that's Taiwan. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=234.08s)]
*  Now, here's an interesting thing. For decades, bipartisan policy consensus in Washington, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  especially under Republicans, and one that I think there's reasonably a little skeptical of, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  right, has been that defense spending doesn't count, doesn't need to be offset. It should not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=250.4s)]
*  be a consideration when discussing strategies for deficit reduction. That has been a hardcore [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=255.52s)]
*  Republican view. Now, this latest ideological twist in the Republican-controlled House, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=260.0s)]
*  that military aid for Israel should be offset, brings us, I think, to a really interesting [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=265.28s)]
*  question. What do MAGA Republicans actually believe? What does the party stand for? What is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=270.08s)]
*  it trying to do as a governing entity? When Donald Trump was president, the answer was pretty clear. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=275.68s)]
*  The MAGA movement stood for fealty to Donald Trump above all else. That fact was made most explicit [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=280.32s)]
*  when the party decided not to even have an official platform in 2020, instead ostensibly [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=286.64s)]
*  defaulting to a platform of whatever Donald Trump wants right now. But without Trump in office, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=291.44s)]
*  and especially during the protracted battle for the Speaker's gavel, as we've been covering on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=298.4s)]
*  this program, I've got to confess, it's been hard to gauge, like, what are you doing? What are you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=302.32s)]
*  guys doing? What are you trying to do? To gauge what even the lines of factional fissure are. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=307.44s)]
*  What does the MAGA caucus want? I mean, on the core issues, it seems like all of the major [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=315.84s)]
*  candidates for Speaker were basically in lockstep. They all hold extreme, unpopular opinions on [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=320.64s)]
*  reproductive rights. Namely, they want to ban abortions. They all want to slash domestic [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  spending for the most vulnerable people in America and the social safety net. All but one supported [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=330.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's attempted coup. And yet, for a while, it felt like none of that was enough to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  unite the party. But now—and this, I think, is really important and cannot be overlooked [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=340.0s)]
*  or overstated—now that they've done it, they got their act together. They've chosen a speaker. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=344.8s)]
*  He got the unanimous assent of the caucus. They're now ready back to govern. Day one, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=351.44s)]
*  agenda item one, MAGA Mike Johnson ascended the speakership, and he has made his party's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=356.88s)]
*  single guiding principle as clear as day. Amidst all this, amidst everything that we've been [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=362.4s)]
*  covering, the images coming out of the Middle East, the testimony that's so brutal and wrenching, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=368.8s)]
*  the war in Ukraine and Russia, the number one priority for House Republicans is what it's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  always been. They want to cut taxes for rich people. I mean, that was famously the only real [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=381.68s)]
*  legislative domestic policy accomplishment of the two years when Republicans controlled Congress [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=388.48s)]
*  and the White House under Trump. What did they get done? A big tax cut for corporations and rich [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=392.64s)]
*  people. It is once again the single binding policy goal, the North Star, for MAGA Republicans in a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=397.68s)]
*  post-Trump Washington, even amidst geopolitical crisis involving one of America's closest allies. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  The MAGA movement will first and foremost, above all else, focus on what it really cares about, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=411.36s)]
*  making it easier for the yacht owners of America to commit tax fraud and get away with it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=417.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7mY0DLqyLE&t=427.68s)]
