# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Aug. 18
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8)
*  Two days before the criminally indicted frontrunners deadline to surrender to justice, the rest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Republican candidates for president will hold their first debate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=5.48s)]
*  The New York Times got its hands on the debate packet for Ron DeSantis, which was apparently [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=8.56s)]
*  accidentally published online. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=13.46s)]
*  It's a pretty funny document. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=15.76s)]
*  It tells DeSantis to defend Donald Trump, who reportedly has chosen not to show up at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  the debate, and to hammer Vivek Ramaswamy, who is rocketing up the polls in New Hampshire [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=21.28s)]
*  as both Trump and DeSantis decline. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=26.42s)]
*  And that strategy, those details, those two lines just kind of perfectly encapsulate the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=29.48s)]
*  bizarro world of Republican presidential primary, in which there is one commanding frontrunner, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=33.56s)]
*  the guy who tried to undo the American Republic facing four criminal trials, found by a jury [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=39.16s)]
*  to be liable for sexual abuse, but none of the other candidates want to actually take [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=42.96s)]
*  him on, except for Chris Christie, who will be at the debate, and former Governor Asa [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=47.28s)]
*  Hutchinson of Arkansas, who as of now has not met the donor requirements to make the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=52.08s)]
*  debate stage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=56.96s)]
*  Governor Asa Hutchinson joins me now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=58.68s)]
*  He was governor of Arkansas from 2015 until this year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=60.56s)]
*  It's good to have you on, sir. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=64.0s)]
*  First, tell me about your status on the... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=65.76s)]
*  I will admit that the metrics for making it got a little in the weeds for me to stay on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=68.6s)]
*  top of. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=74.4s)]
*  So where are you in terms of that? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=75.4s)]
*  Well, thanks, Chris, and we're going to make the debate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=78.52s)]
*  And the RNC requires 40,000 unique donors to make the debate stage. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=83.52s)]
*  We're getting close. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  We've got till Monday, close of business, to make that 40,000. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  And so asa2024.com is where you go to make sure I get on the debate stage. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=94.72s)]
*  And I'm not going to defend Donald Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=100.92s)]
*  I will be a prosecutor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=102.96s)]
*  I will be telling the truth on Donald Trump, and whether he's there or not, he will be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=104.92s)]
*  a focal point of issue, both what happened on January 6th, but also how he will not lead [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=109.4s)]
*  the Republican Party well into the future. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  So this sort of encapsulates the issue here, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  The bind everyone's in. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  You and Chris Christie, at least, have a theory of the case, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, the frontrunner, is unfit for office. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=128.44s)]
*  He shouldn't be the president. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  And also, he's a political liability. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  I think both you and Christie think he's actually not a strong nominee. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=133.56s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=138.52s)]
*  The problem is, Republicans don't seem to want to hear that, the vast majority of the base, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=139.68s)]
*  So I mean, our viewers might like that, but they're probably not voting in the Republican primary. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=147.24s)]
*  The question is, how do you make that case to the people that most need to hear it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=152.44s)]
*  Well, great question. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=158.08s)]
*  And of course, I'm in Iowa. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=159.28s)]
*  And the sense I get in Iowa is that Donald Trump is in the default position right now [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=160.84s)]
*  until they decide where they want to go as to the best alternative. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=166.04s)]
*  The debate will play a key role in that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=170.32s)]
*  But let me assure you that the Iowans that I talk to recognize if we're going to win, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=172.8s)]
*  we've got to go in a different direction. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=178.04s)]
*  There's too much smoke there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=180.04s)]
*  And they're really discouraged by it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=181.64s)]
*  So the debate is that opportunity for me to make sure that we showcase the alternative, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=183.24s)]
*  a different direction from Donald Trump and hold him accountable as he should be. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=189.56s)]
*  You know, let me ask you this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=195.72s)]
*  This is a question I'm obsessed with. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, I don't really have a dog in this fight. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=198.84s)]
*  It's, you know, who are the Republicans? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=200.36s)]
*  Nominated aside from my love of our country and America's constitutional democracy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=202.44s)]
*  And one thing that I just feel like would keep me up at nights, if I were anyone who worked [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=208.32s)]
*  in Republican politics, is this kind of nightmare scenario, timing wise, where Trump rolls [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=212.56s)]
*  to win the nomination and he secures it just as he goes on trial for the gravest political [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=217.72s)]
*  crime since the session and maybe is convicted. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=224.6s)]
*  And then it's like it's the summer, maybe it's before or after the RNC, the Republican [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Party's got this nominee who's just been convicted. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=231.04s)]
*  That just seems like a nightmare. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=233.68s)]
*  And no one in the Republican Party seems nearly as freaked out about that as I am when I think [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=234.68s)]
*  about it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=240.28s)]
*  Well, it's a realistic possibility. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=241.28s)]
*  And I've actually made the case that you were in a terrible position in Iowa, New Hampshire, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=244.56s)]
*  federal cases and state cases are not going to be resolved with Donald Trump before they [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=251.72s)]
*  start voting in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary and probably even Super [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=258.0s)]
*  Tuesday. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=262.56s)]
*  And so what are the voters supposed to do? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=263.56s)]
*  And so that's where I think you'll see a gradual shift. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=265.6s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=268.56s)]
*  By speaking the truth, by reality coming to them that we can't win with Donald Trump and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=269.98s)]
*  we have to go a different direction. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=275.68s)]
*  What I think they're looking at is who's going to be that alternative? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=277.48s)]
*  And of course, that's what we're fighting for. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  And that'll be a focus of the debate coming up next Wednesday. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's the interesting question, right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=285.56s)]
*  Like, who is going to be that alternative? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  I really think there's there's two categories. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=289.16s)]
*  I think you and Chris Christie are making a case. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=291.88000000000005s)]
*  The front runner is unfit to serve and a political liability. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  So and here's what I've done. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=298.12s)]
*  You're both ex governors. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  Here's why I'd be a good president. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  Everyone else seems to be just kind of like waiting around for the guy to like end up [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=303.48s)]
*  in the clink or like be like beamed up to Mars or something. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=306.88s)]
*  And what are they like? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=311.8s)]
*  What's how is that going to work? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=314.44s)]
*  Well, and that's where I believe that you have to be clear on what happened on January [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=318.0s)]
*  6th. You can't be intimidated by a teenager who asks you a question as to what happened [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=323.52s)]
*  on January 6th and what's your views. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=328.8s)]
*  It was an attack on our democracy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=331.04s)]
*  And so on the debate next Wednesday, there's not just going to be a difference with Donald [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=333.2s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=337.16s)]
*  There'll be a difference between the candidates. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=338.16s)]
*  Some of the candidates will be defending Donald Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=339.32s)]
*  I'll certainly be on the side of telling the truth. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=341.92s)]
*  But that's a defining moment. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=344.84s)]
*  Who's going to be promising pardons? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=346.44s)]
*  I don't think that's appropriate during a campaign. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=348.24s)]
*  Others do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=350.92s)]
*  And so this is a critical time for us. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=351.92s)]
*  OK, so you're on the trail. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=354.04s)]
*  You're actually talking to the kinds of now I imagine there's a little selection bias. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=356.12s)]
*  Folks talking to you tend to be interested in your message. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=359.64s)]
*  And I'm sure you're like, what are you what are you getting back? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=362.88s)]
*  What are those back and forth like? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=365.56s)]
*  Do they know who you are? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  Are they like, you're the guy who hates Donald Trump and get out of my face? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=368.08s)]
*  Are they like, what are those interactions been like? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  No, actually, it's not like that at all. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=375.08s)]
*  I mean, there's the media intensity on this issue. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=377.88s)]
*  But whenever you talk to Iowans, there's a little bit of discouragement about what they [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=381.4s)]
*  in some instances, but also that our Washington is not working. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=388.12s)]
*  But they're very interested in what's my view of energy policy? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  What's my view of agriculture? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=398.08s)]
*  What's my view of Ukraine? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  So they get in and ask those subsidy questions. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=401.52s)]
*  And that, quite frankly, is one of the reasons the debate is going to be exciting next week [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=404.36s)]
*  that we can talk about some real policy issues if Donald Trump's not going to be there, even [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=408.6s)]
*  though he'll still be there in spirit and will be a subject that we'll all be talking about. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=412.88s)]
*  Well, I do think it would be good to hear some sort of substantive contention about [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=418.24s)]
*  how people plan to govern and what they want to do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=424.24s)]
*  It would be really good to put that on full display and hash that out. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=427.92s)]
*  Governor Asa Hutchinson, thanks for making some time with us tonight. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=431.68s)]
*  Thank you and appreciate going to Asa2024.com. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=436.0s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=439.44s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=442.88s)]
*  So we are living through the hottest summer, not just of our lifetimes, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=446.08s)]
*  probably the last 100,000 years or so, best as we can tell. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=448.96s)]
*  And every day brings some new near biblical level event. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=452.24s)]
*  We just had the Maui fires last week. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=455.04s)]
*  Devastating. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=456.96s)]
*  People there are currently dealing with the immediate aftermath, trying to recover. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=458.0s)]
*  They're going to be trying to recover for a long time. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=461.12s)]
*  And now California is under its first tropical storm watch ever, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=463.84s)]
*  with a category four hurricane headed towards Los Angeles, of all places. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=469.12s)]
*  A thing that, in all honesty, I had no idea could happen. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=474.0s)]
*  In fact, until about 24 hours ago, as someone who, you know, covers this stuff from time to time, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=477.44s)]
*  it was my strong understanding that there were typhoons in the Pacific that went from east to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=482.24s)]
*  west and crashed into places like Philippines and Japan, and that there were hurricanes in the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=485.6s)]
*  Atlantic that also went from east to west and would make landfall in Florida or the Gulf Coast [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=490.08s)]
*  or up the eastern seaboard. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=494.0s)]
*  I didn't know there was such a thing as a hurricane that could hit Southern California. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=496.0s)]
*  That appears to be about to happen. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=501.36s)]
*  Right now, Hurricane Hillary is a category four storm. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  It's about 300 miles south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, winds topping out at 130 miles per hour. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=506.72s)]
*  This is the projected path. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=513.84s)]
*  It could hit LA sometime on Sunday. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=515.12s)]
*  The wind speed could hopefully drop below hurricane status. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  At least that's what we think as of now. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  Paul Douglas is a senior meteorologist at PredicTix, as well as a weather columnist [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=525.36s)]
*  from Minnesota's Star Tribune, and he joins me now. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=529.44s)]
*  First, I guess, Paul, like, what, what, how is this happening? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=534.0s)]
*  I'm not wrong that this doesn't generally happen, shouldn't be happening. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=537.76s)]
*  It is surreal, even for a meteorologist. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=543.36s)]
*  I mean, usually the water temperatures in the Pacific are too chilly to support [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=546.16s)]
*  tropical systems. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=552.4s)]
*  Hurricanes, the warmer the water, the greater the potential for intensification. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  But with upwelling trade winds coming in, west winds coming in off the Pacific, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  it usually brings the colder water to the surface off the coast of LA, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=563.76s)]
*  and that really prevents these storms from intensifying. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  But as you just mentioned, water temperatures worldwide, off the scale, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=573.68s)]
*  air temperatures this summer have been off the scale, Antarctic sea ice loss, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=579.44s)]
*  off the scale, all these things, and we have a developing El Nino, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=585.44s)]
*  so the water is unusually warm right now, in Alpaca, Mexico, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=589.36s)]
*  and this thing is a big deal. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=593.12s)]
*  And it's going to come ashore probably near Tijuana or San Diego, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=594.96s)]
*  has a strong tropical storm, winds 50, 60, 70 miles an hour, at least in gusts. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=599.2s)]
*  The primary threat, though, Chris, is going to be biblical rain, 5, 10 inches, Palm Springs, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=606.0s)]
*  east of San Diego, some of the eastern suburbs now of Los Angeles, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=613.2s)]
*  under a high threat of extreme flooding, including Riverside, San Bernardino, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=618.0s)]
*  the Inland Empire, three, three and a half million people under the gun, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=623.12s)]
*  and the primary concern is midday Sunday to midday Monday, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=627.68s)]
*  when the flooding threat is going to be off the scale. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=632.24s)]
*  Some flooding in downtown LA and San Diego, I think the worst of it's staying just east, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=634.8s)]
*  but Las Vegas could also see 5, 6, 8 inches of rain, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=640.24s)]
*  one to two years worth of rain, Chris, in one to two days. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  That's going to cause problems. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=648.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's one, you know, one again, one of the things that I've been learning covering all this, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=651.12s)]
*  and again, you've sort of learning every day because new stuff is happening, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=654.88s)]
*  is just we saw this Hurricane Harvey in Houston, and how brutal that, you know, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=658.64s)]
*  it wasn't the wind there, it was the amount of water dumped into that metro area and what that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=663.52s)]
*  did, and we just see it in other places where, you know, if enough rain falls, right, it just [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=669.04s)]
*  can't be absorbed, it's got to all go somewhere. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=674.56s)]
*  I've got to imagine, not an expert on this, but in a place like Death Valley, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=677.28s)]
*  or the desert, you know, around the Inland Empire, right, east of LA, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=680.72s)]
*  that whole strip of what is literal desert, the ground, I mean, I just don't know how, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=683.92s)]
*  like, how does that work? What happens to that environment if you dump [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=690.72s)]
*  six inches of water in, you know, 24 hours? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  It immediately, almost immediately runs off. It's not like the nice topsoil we get east of Rockies. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=698.4s)]
*  It's very hard, compacted sand, and it doesn't absorb the water, so the water runs off. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=705.28s)]
*  And I have friends in Palm Springs, the Coachella Valley, the mountains east of San Diego, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=713.36s)]
*  beautiful area, but again, they are in for some of the worst flooding that area has ever seen, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=718.32s)]
*  and the storm is lifting northward towards Las Vegas, eventually into Wyoming and Idaho. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=724.8s)]
*  There could be significant flooding there, but I never thought in a million years, Chris, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=730.64s)]
*  that the first state to be impacted by a tropical system would not be Florida, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=736.32s)]
*  or Texas, or Louisiana, it's California. It's just mind-blowing, and I think a lot [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=740.96s)]
*  of meteorologists feel the same way. Yeah, so let's go back to circle back [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=747.12s)]
*  to that original point you made, because I just want to make sure I'm parsing it. So [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=752.0s)]
*  the Atlantic tends to be warmer than the Pacific, my understanding is, and that that band of warm [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=754.96s)]
*  water is where those tropical storms develop. They go east to west, and then depending on what [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=759.92s)]
*  happens, they'll go into the Gulf, they'll hit Florida, the Gulf, the eastern seaboard. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=764.96s)]
*  The way that water temperatures in the Pacific work and the trade business work, it just usually [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=769.44s)]
*  isn't hot enough to support the storm, basically. The heat is what's bringing the energy, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=774.64s)]
*  and so in this case, we've got an ocean that's off the scale. I mean, it's the warmest the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=778.24s)]
*  world's oceans have ever been, and that's really the root but for cause of why we're getting this. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=783.36s)]
*  That's the gasoline being poured on the flames right now. Unusually warm water in the equatorial [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=789.84s)]
*  Pacific. You really have a combination of factors. It's not just one thing. It's a developing [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=796.0s)]
*  El Nino. It could be a super El Nino, the biggest since 97, 98, that one stain of water in the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=801.6s)]
*  equatorial Pacific. You also have warming, right? Excess CO2 and methane contributing to the warming, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=808.24s)]
*  and all of these factors are enabling this storm to become a major hurricane, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=816.32s)]
*  and it probably is going to strike as a tropical storm, not a hurricane, but this is going to be a [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=822.32s)]
*  big deal for Southern California, possibly right on up to Las Vegas, again, midday Sunday through [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=828.32s)]
*  midday Monday. A lot of climate scientists, I have to tell you, you've been covering this, Chris, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  the way this year is turning out, they are concerned. Many of them are scared. Things [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  seem to be happening faster than the climate models were predicting 10 years ago. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HXlZsIUYR8&t=846.5600000000001s)]
