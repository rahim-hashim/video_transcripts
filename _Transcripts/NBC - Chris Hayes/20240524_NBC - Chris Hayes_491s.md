# ‘Apocalyptic’ American surgeon on his two weeks inside Gaza’s ruined hospitals
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck)
*  Since the war in Gaza began, we've had many doctors and human rights advocates on this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=0.0s)]
*  program rescue workers as well to describe the deteriorating medical emergency there. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=3.84s)]
*  But we rarely if ever actually get to see it for ourselves from their eyes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=9.0s)]
*  Dr. Samar Atar is an American orthopedic oncology surgeon based in Chicago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=13.56s)]
*  He also volunteers his time in war zones, including places like Iraq, Ukraine, and Syria. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=19.0s)]
*  He recently spent two weeks in Gaza and says the situation there is the worst he has ever [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  seen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=29.04s)]
*  In a 13-minute opinion video diary published by the New York Times, Dr. Atar shows us firsthand [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=30.04s)]
*  just how catastrophic the situation has become for Palestinians in Gaza's hospitals. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  A warning, what you are about to see is graphic and really hard to watch at times. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=41.0s)]
*  The longer this war goes on, the more wounds will become infected. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=46.36s)]
*  The more limbs will have to be amputated. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=51.76s)]
*  Without more resources, even the people who are lucky enough to survive will be permanently [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=53.92s)]
*  disabled. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=58.76s)]
*  On one of my last days, I come across a man collecting dirt. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=59.76s)]
*  Going up the staircase. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=68.2s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=71.56s)]
*  You weren't kidding when you said you got a farm. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=73.56s)]
*  His wife is pregnant and he's planning a garden to grow food for his future child. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  I will have a baby after three months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=81.2s)]
*  I try to have some vegetables. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=86.68s)]
*  You can see. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=89.76s)]
*  The first. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=90.76s)]
*  The first. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=91.76s)]
*  Joining me now is Dr. Samer Atar, who just returned to the U.S. from Gaza last month. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=92.76s)]
*  Doctor, thank you so much for sharing some time and for the footage you took. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=99.08s)]
*  I want to just start by level setting your experience here because I was struck that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=102.56s)]
*  very early part of your medical career just gone to war zones, to places where you're [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=107.68s)]
*  already under duress from a medical standpoint. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=112.76s)]
*  I want to ask you to compare your experience in northern Gaza to what you've experienced [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  in other places. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=121.92s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=123.92000000000002s)]
*  The thing about northern Gaza or Gaza in general is that there are only so many functioning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  hospitals in Ukraine. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=132.0s)]
*  There are a lot of hospitals, a lot of staff. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=133.0s)]
*  In Gaza, there's only one place, one hospital where everything gets funneled. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=135.24s)]
*  And so if there's an attack, there's a bomb, all of the horror, all the dead bodies, all [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=139.52s)]
*  the injured, they all get funneled into one spot. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=144.0s)]
*  And you see it all happening all at once. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=147.28s)]
*  And I think that's what's so shocking about Gaza is that it's so small, it's so compact, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=149.52s)]
*  it's so tight, millions of people packed together. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  It all happens all at once. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  You were in northern Gaza for two weeks, and that's a part that it's been harder to get [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  to talk to people who've been there because it has been so under bombardment and so evacuated. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=163.0s)]
*  Tell us where you were and what you saw there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=168.14s)]
*  We worked at Kamal Adwan and out at hospitals, which are currently under attack. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  The World Health Organization dropped us off and basically said, just bring food for a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=177.32s)]
*  month in case you get stranded, which is what would have happened if we were there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=182.24s)]
*  Really, it's just an apocalyptic landscape of rubble and hunger, homelessness, bombardment. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=186.32s)]
*  Every day we were doing amputations. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Every day we were seeing people show up starving to death. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=198.38s)]
*  We'd see folks, moms and dads, their kids, they hadn't had food or water for days. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=201.72s)]
*  And at that point when they come in, the damage is irreversible. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=207.76s)]
*  Could I stop you right there? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=210.4s)]
*  Could I just stop you right there because we talked a lot about famine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about people actually presenting at the hospital starving, literally starving [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=214.2s)]
*  to death. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  What do you do as a doctor in that situation? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  What can you do? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  There's not much you can do except hold the hands of the people that brought them in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  One night they brought in a 20-year-old girl. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=227.88s)]
*  She was brought in by her dad. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, they brought in a 32-year-old woman. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  The mom and dad and the son brought her in. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  And they just hadn't had food or water for days, and she deteriorated. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=236.44s)]
*  At that point, you can just give fluids and just see what happens, but they're not responsive. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=240.48s)]
*  They're not opening their eyes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=245.44s)]
*  And they die. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  And all you can really do is just let the family know that you're there and you did [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  your best. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=252.16s)]
*  But that's pretty much it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=253.16s)]
*  That's medicine in North Gaza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  You talk also about amputations. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=258.12s)]
*  You talk about having to intubate folks and try with the best that you have. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=259.76s)]
*  These hospitals themselves have sustained huge amounts of artillery or bombs. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=265.28s)]
*  What is the status of just the basics of medical equipment in the actual facility? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=272.84s)]
*  There's blood everywhere. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  Sterility is a suggestion, as I've said. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  We're using instruments from the 19th century. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  So to do an amputation, we're using manual saws. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=286.84s)]
*  We're putting in pins without any electricity, without any power tools. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=291.64s)]
*  Oftentimes we wouldn't have anesthesia. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  Oftentimes the power runs out and we're operating under cell phone light. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  My first mission, I did 11 amputations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=303.96s)]
*  I was involved in 11 amputation surgeries in one day back in December. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=305.84s)]
*  That's when I stopped counting. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=310.32s)]
*  The northern Gaza security situation is particularly abject, as I understand it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=313.88s)]
*  The Hamas is no longer functioning there or was routed from there, although the Israeli [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=322.52s)]
*  military went back in. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=328.08s)]
*  What is the social order there like? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=332.8s)]
*  There's no governing authority in any official sense. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=336.2s)]
*  There's nothing functioning in terms of the basics of society or governance. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=338.72s)]
*  What is it like for people there? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I never got the sense there was any governing order. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=346.20000000000005s)]
*  It was just a bunch of people in trouble and they were all relying on each other. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=349.36s)]
*  They were kind of all relying on the kindness of each other. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=352.92s)]
*  The thing about these hospitals is that they're little, these oases where when people come, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=355.04s)]
*  they know they're going to be good people there, they're going to get taken care of. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=360.66s)]
*  That's why a lot of people live there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  That's why a lot of people want to live in the hospitals or around the hospitals, because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=364.88s)]
*  it's kind of like an oasis of peace. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=369.68s)]
*  Did you have fighters there? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=372.76s)]
*  I know that as a doctor, you give medical attention to whoever comes in the door. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=374.32s)]
*  This is part of the Hippocratic Oath. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=378.68s)]
*  Did you have people coming in who had been in gun battles or things like that? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=380.04s)]
*  Yeah, we just treat sick and injured. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't see good and evil, but I didn't see any fighters. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=386.6s)]
*  I would have had no idea anyway. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=391.48s)]
*  So most of the people I treated were women and children. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=394.44s)]
*  The last picture you showed, that last video we played, has really stuck with me of the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=398.92s)]
*  man growing the garden on his roof and his wife being pregnant. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=403.24s)]
*  And you talk about the kind of resilience of people there who are just trying to plan [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=410.76s)]
*  for something better than what is there right now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=414.3s)]
*  Yeah, I just kind of ran into him. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=418.36s)]
*  He's actually the brother of the anesthetist, Neen. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=421.56s)]
*  And it's just sad. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=425.0s)]
*  She is the only one who got back to me. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=430.12s)]
*  I haven't been able to reach anyone I worked with, any of my friends who I worked with, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=431.72s)]
*  any of the doctors or nurses at Kamala Juan or out of hospital. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=436.08s)]
*  She was the only one. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=439.46s)]
*  She sent me a voicemail today. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=441.08s)]
*  I asked her about her brother, but she never responded. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=443.52s)]
*  And she seemed to be in a lot of distress. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=445.94s)]
*  So I think about him a lot too, because he's just trying to provide for his wife and his [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=448.26s)]
*  daughter. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=454.46s)]
*  But that last shot was right in front of Kamala Juan. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4BEHn5U9Ck&t=455.46s)]
