Video Description: “Maybe Donald Trump doesn't have the actual energy to do the job. Maybe letting Elon Musk basically conduct diplomacy and talk to Hill lawmakers while Trump collects awards from his fans is just the division of labor Trump can handle,” says Chris Hayes. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) joins to discuss.

# ‘This is insane’ Trump letting Elon Musk steal the spotlight
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ)
*  The world's richest man, Elon Musk, spent yesterday on Capitol Hill being celebrated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  by Republicans who gave off the vibe that Musk's budget-slashing, workforce-purging [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  agenda is their agenda. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=8.84s)]
*  It's going to be the agenda of the new Congress. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=10.52s)]
*  He walked around Capitol Hill, frankly, like he owned the place. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=12.44s)]
*  Related to that, we have new details on his campaign spending. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=16.16s)]
*  Elon Musk spent a quarter of a billion dollars to elect Donald Trump this year, much of it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=20.16s)]
*  donated in the last weeks of the campaign, so it wouldn't come out until after the election. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=24.78s)]
*  That's the way this reporting works. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=29.24s)]
*  It's an insane amount of money. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=30.639999999999997s)]
*  But look at the returns. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=32.96s)]
*  Investors are suddenly very bullish on Musk's companies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=35.04s)]
*  He's been hanging around at Mar-a-Lago, weighing in on hiring decisions, joining a call between [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  Trump and the Ukrainian president for some reason. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=41.76s)]
*  He's been called co-president by some in Trump world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  And today, multiple outlets are reporting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, recently [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=47.04s)]
*  called Elon Musk in hopes of getting the incoming U.S. administration to re-open talks for the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=51.56s)]
*  release of hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=57.32s)]
*  You would think that's the sitting president's job, Joe Biden, who's still president of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=58.88s)]
*  United States for another month and a half, or if not him, then the incoming president's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  job, Donald Trump, who was duly elected, shouldn't be the job of his top campaign donor that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=67.64s)]
*  no one elected. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=73.68s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=76.28s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=77.28s)]
*  It's precisely what advocates of campaign finance reform warned would happen in a post-Citizens [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=79.12s)]
*  United world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=84.68s)]
*  So while Musk is basically running the presidential transition, where exactly is the president-elect, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=86.16s)]
*  the oldest man ever elected in the history of the republic? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=90.64s)]
*  It's clear on the campaign trail Trump has lost a separatist, and that makes sense. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  He's almost 80. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=97.8s)]
*  Since then, he's mostly hung out and golfed at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=100.16s)]
*  He did finally get out of the house yesterday for a very important event to receive an honorary [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=102.44s)]
*  Patriot of the Year award on Fox Nation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=106.6s)]
*  Maybe Trump doesn't have the actual energy to do the job, maybe letting Elon Musk basically [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Conduct diplomacy, talk to Hill lawmakers while Trump collects awards from his fans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=115.48s)]
*  is the division of labor that Trump can handle. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=119.92s)]
*  Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett sits on the House Oversight Committee. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=123.96s)]
*  She also represents a district in the state of Texas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=126.96s)]
*  Elon Musk's new base of operations, and she joins me now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=129.52s)]
*  What do you make of this figure that we have never really had in the time that I've covered [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=134.36s)]
*  American politics? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=138.62s)]
*  A richest man in the world with no public role officially, no accountability, not Senate [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=140.22s)]
*  confirmed or anything, running a kind of off the book operation in the name of the president [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=145.76s)]
*  he spent a quarter of a billion dollars to elect, who has a million conflicts and seems [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=150.34s)]
*  to be like sort of calling the shots. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=154.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Chris, I am just as lost as you are. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=156.3s)]
*  You know, when Elon decided that he was going to be on the trail and he was running around [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=162.88s)]
*  and jumping around on the stage and that kind of stuff, I mean, it was clear that he was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  fully in to make sure that he could support him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=171.74s)]
*  You know, he had announced that he was going to spend millions of dollars, hundreds of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=175.44s)]
*  millions of dollars. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=179.94s)]
*  We didn't know that it would get all the way to a quarter of a billion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=180.94s)]
*  But honestly, I thought that this was really a lot more of the pay for play, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  It's the pay for play that Donald Trump has consistently offered to those oil tycoons [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=188.38s)]
*  and anybody else that had a lot of money and was willing to put it behind him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=194.18s)]
*  You put it behind me and I will give you something in return. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=198.42s)]
*  So we know that he's got these federal contracts. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  And I just assumed that it was about that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=203.66s)]
*  I had no idea that he would then end up with this random position with a new randomly created [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=205.1s)]
*  organization. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=212.14s)]
*  And now that he would be sitting and doing the diplomacy that really should be left to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=213.7s)]
*  the president elect of the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  You are in a state where I've heard this from multiple folks that cover Texas politics [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=222.46s)]
*  that Musk really has the Texas capital quite wired. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=226.74s)]
*  This is the Houston Chronicle writing about this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=231.56s)]
*  He's betting Trump will also make most of the 20 federal investigations into his companies [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=235.38s)]
*  disappear. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=239.18s)]
*  He probably is looking to benefit from state contracts and the 17 agencies that have generated [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=240.22s)]
*  three billion dollars in revenue last year. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=246.18s)]
*  But also that he's he's kind of used the Texas statehouse as a bit of a laboratory [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=247.86s)]
*  for accruing political influence. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you talk about the Supreme Court decision as relates to our federal elections. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=254.66000000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you, in the state of Texas, we have no campaign finance limits at all. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=268.1s)]
*  And so what we have is a governor who has been elected more times than anybody else [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=269.1s)]
*  because we also don't have a term limit on our governor. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=273.56s)]
*  So we are stuck with Abbott because every time he gets in trouble, he calls up somebody [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=276.46s)]
*  that he's going to help out and he say, I need another million dollars. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=281.26s)]
*  Listen, for those of you that went out and voted and thought that you were going to vote [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  for somebody that was going to be for you, let me tell you, Trump is showing you exactly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=289.26s)]
*  who he is for. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=294.46s)]
*  He is for the people that put up the real dollars, not your five dollars or your two [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=295.96s)]
*  dollars. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  He is for the people that put up the hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  And I don't really know where that leaves the rest of us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=304.66s)]
*  I can tell you that in the state of Texas, it has not left us in a good place. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=307.06s)]
*  There are a number of Democrats who have either committed to working with this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  We're again, off book operate. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=318.06s)]
*  I don't even know what to call it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  It's not department. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  It's right now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  It's just a string of letters. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  It's just two guys. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  Jared Moskowitz, who's a colleague of yours in Florida, who's a Democrat, I think is working [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  with it in some official capacity. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=331.1s)]
*  Congressman from California Silicon Valley says he's he wants to get involved with it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=333.58s)]
*  What do you think about Democrats saying, hey, we should be open minded here and maybe [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=338.02s)]
*  work with these two individuals to slash wasteful government spending? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=343.46s)]
*  Listen, I don't I don't know what's happening. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=348.06s)]
*  I mean, I do know that Jared did join this caucus and a caucus is different from an actual [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=352.46s)]
*  committee. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=359.14s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, right now we don't have our committee assignments, so I don't know who's going to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  serve on what committee. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  I will tell you that they did decide that they were going to have a subcommittee on [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  oversight for Doge. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=369.5s)]
*  And it is going to be led by none other than Marjorie Taylor Green. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=371.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=374.86s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see who becomes the ranking member on that subcommittee. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=375.86s)]
*  And when we start to talk about the committee work, then yes, that is actual work of the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=379.5s)]
*  House. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=383.7s)]
*  And whoever is assigned to work on oversight and assigned to that subcommittee, then they [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=384.78s)]
*  will start to do the work. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=388.74s)]
*  But oversight in and of itself exists to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse in the government. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=390.02000000000004s)]
*  That is our job. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=395.18s)]
*  And we oversee every single agency. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=396.18s)]
*  And that is what we are supposed to be doing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=398.48s)]
*  But what they are proposing right now from the likes of Ramaswamy talking about getting [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  rid of 70 percent of the workforce. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=404.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, let me tell you, everybody that is complained about how behind their passports were or their [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=406.5s)]
*  Social Security checks being messed up or the IRS checks not arriving on time. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=411.3s)]
*  Well, let me tell you something is about to happen. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCbaXwlvQ&t=416.3s)]
