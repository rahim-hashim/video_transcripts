# Rep. Rashida Tlaib responds to House censure vote
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg)
*  I will not be silenced and I will not let you distort my words. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=0.0s)]
*  I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=5.0s)]
*  We are human beings, just like anyone else. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=10.0s)]
*  The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=32.0s)]
*  Why, what I don't understand is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you all. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=37.0s)]
*  Last night, 22 House Democrats joined with the Republican majority to censure the only Palestinian American in Congress, Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=45.0s)]
*  The resolution accused the congressman of, quote, promoting false narratives regarding the October 7th, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=54.0s)]
*  The congresswoman denies these accusations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=64.0s)]
*  The resolution also objects to a passage in a video she released earlier this month that calls on President Joe Biden to support a ceasefire in Gaza, specifically a segment of that video that depicted protesters in Tlaib's home state of Michigan, chanting the phrase you see there from the river to the sea. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=67.0s)]
*  Now the resolution called that chant, which is commonly used by some pro-Palestinian activists, quote, a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people and to replace it with a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=82.0s)]
*  In a statement, Congresswoman Tlaib rejected that characterization, instead calling it, quote, an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=96.0s)]
*  And Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib joins me now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=108.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=110.0s)]
*  I just want to start by asking what your conversations with your Democratic colleagues have been like over the last 24 hours, particularly if you've talked to any of the 22 that voted for the censure resolution. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=112.0s)]
*  I mean, many of my colleagues know I have an open door policy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=123.0s)]
*  They can come and talk to me about this and they know the conversation will lead and me urging them to please save as many lives as possible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=128.0s)]
*  And that means calling for a ceasefire. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=135.0s)]
*  Again, my colleagues know where my heart is and they know that I have been pushing from day one of coexistence of the days where my both my grandparents when they were born there that there was coexistence among all faiths living in peace. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=137.0s)]
*  And, you know, much of what I'm seeing is distortion distortion of my words also in trying to silence my residents who have been calling from the beginning of freedom, freedom from inequality, freedom from the occupation, freedom from the violence. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=152.0s)]
*  And so it has been really difficult, I think, for me as I walk on the House floor, walking there, watching many of the colleagues that voted for this not engage me and they know I'm ready. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=168.0s)]
*  I'm ready to have those conversations and I think they're missing an opportunity to talk to a Palestinian, a Palestinian American serving with them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=179.0s)]
*  I have a lived experience that needs to be shared and be heard. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=187.0s)]
*  I want to sort of stipulate here that I don't I think the central resolution is a sort of ludicrous distraction amidst the sheer amount of human suffering happening in the region. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=191.0s)]
*  So, you know, just to put that aside, but I do want to talk about this phrase because obviously this was a phrase that I think really caught some folks, I think, Jewish Americans supporters of Israel, different folks and it reads differently different people from the river to the sea. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=200.0s)]
*  The contention is that this this is a call for a kind of anti colonial expulsion right similar to like Algeria kicking out the French right like get out of here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=215.0s)]
*  Go back to wherever you came from. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=225.0s)]
*  This is how it's heard, I think, to a lot of Jewish ears. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=227.0s)]
*  And so I want you to explain like what you mean by it and why you used it or why you included in the video. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=230.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I'm asking my colleagues don't distort the words of my residents. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=236.0s)]
*  Many people in this movement for human rights for Palestinians have always centered around coexistence. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=241.0s)]
*  You hear them calling for that and saying that, you know, no matter your faith, your ethnicity, your background, you should be able to live without fear, without discrimination, without this kind of inequality that, you know, Netanyahu's extremist party and his leadership has been pushing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=246.0s)]
*  And so for many of my colleagues, they know and deep in their hearts where my heart is and many of the folks, including the American Jewish community that's out there demanding again the call again against this this notion that we can't all live together. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=261.0s)]
*  And so I think again, this is just a moment right now that folks want to use the specific moment to silence the majority of Americans that are calling for a ceasefire to silence this movement around actual peaceful coexistence. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=277.0s)]
*  Because right now, that's not what Netanyahu wants. Netanyahu's current government, most extremist government in the history of Israel, is not calling for that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=291.0s)]
*  He's going to United Nations and basically showing maps where Palestinians don't exist. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=300.0s)]
*  And so I wish my colleagues would call out that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=305.0s)]
*  Just to be clear here, I mean, when you talk about peaceful coexistence, you imagine a pluralistic democratic state in the full land from the river to the sea with people called the one state solution. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=308.0s)]
*  But that would be fundamentally the people that adhere to Zionism and think Israel should exist as a Jewish state. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=317.0s)]
*  Like, they're just not going to like that. I'm not. I just want to clarify what the actual positions are. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=323.0s)]
*  And, you know, Chris, look, I grew up in the most beautiful, blackest city in the country where separate but equal didn't work. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=327.0s)]
*  We saw it in our own country, but I'm not going to push it on the people. If folks want to push for a two state, go for it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=333.0s)]
*  But guess what? Guess what? Netanyahu's current government is not supporting that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=337.0s)]
*  He's literally said it to us over and over again. He doesn't want to coexist with Palestinians. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=342.0s)]
*  And we're saying, no, we're going to have a peaceful, a peaceful coexistence in pushing against those that want to target people solely based on the fact they're Palestinian or of a different faith. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=348.0s)]
*  And again, that's what my city that I grew up and taught me is to push against that kind of racism, that kind of discrimination and that kind of again call for elimination. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=358.0s)]
*  If I'll use the words he said, cleanse Gaza. You know, this is what I have to continue to speak truth to power on. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=367.0s)]
*  And I'm not going to allow I'm not going to allow folks to distort or try to silence or again, try to make out that my residents are calling for something, anything, anything but the end to the violence. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=374.0s)]
*  You have worked assiduously on behalf of obviously you represent a community that has a lot of folks that are from the Middle East and particularly Palestinian. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=386.0s)]
*  You've worked assiduously on behalf of, I believe, two residents who were American residents who were trapped in Gaza. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=394.0s)]
*  I read an account today that talked about how much your efforts were instrumental in bringing them home out of Gaza. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=400.0s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about what that experience was like trying to get to Americans to safety here back in the U.S.? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=408.0s)]
*  I mean, Zechariah and Layla are finally home back home safely in Michigan. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=414.0s)]
*  But it was an awful, horrific experience. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=418.0s)]
*  They're Americans. And what I saw from the State Department and Secretary Blinken's leadership is every single day that myself and many of my colleagues were asking, what is the plan to get Americans out of Gaza? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=421.0s)]
*  There was no plan for days. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=433.0s)]
*  And to me, that put the lives of Americans at risk. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=435.0s)]
*  And what I heard from Zechariah, who was sheltering after his family's home was bombed, was sheltered in a hospital with his wife, is that he said it smelled like death, that every single day he was worried that his life was going to be taken. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=438.0s)]
*  He would leave me voice text, Chris, just begging, urging, please tell them to get us out of here. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=452.0s)]
*  Please tell them to stop. Everything he saw was women and children coming into that hospital. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=459.0s)]
*  They didn't have food. They didn't have electricity. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=463.0s)]
*  He just had run out of his medication literally a few days before he was evacuated. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=465.0s)]
*  And, you know, he just was in despair. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=469.0s)]
*  I cannot express to you enough how hard it is as a member of Congress asking, again, our government to please, please help save the lives of Americans, get them out. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=472.0s)]
*  And again, they didn't move with the urgency that I was hoping. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=482.0s)]
*  But he's home. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=485.0s)]
*  He's home. But one of the things you should know, Chris, is the overwhelming guilt that he's home safe and his family is still in Gaza right now being bombarded. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=486.0s)]
*  And every day he worries that they're not going to be able to live through this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=495.0s)]
*  Congressman Rashid, to leave the lone Palestinian American member of Congress representing the city of Detroit, thank you so much for making time for us tonight. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=500.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=507.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2-TEp90bLg&t=516.0s)]
