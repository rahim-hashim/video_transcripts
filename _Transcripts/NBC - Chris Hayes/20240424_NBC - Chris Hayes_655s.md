# WaPo Meadows, Giuliani and other Trump allies indicted over Arizona 2020 election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA)
*  Mary McCord spent nearly 20 years as a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=0.0s)]
*  D.C. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=3.96s)]
*  She litigated a case against the Wisconsin fake elector. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=4.96s)]
*  She currently co-hosts the Webby Award MSNBC podcast, Prosecuting Donald Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=7.44s)]
*  Tom Joslin was a senior staffer on the January 6th Committee and a principal drafter of their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  final report. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=16.28s)]
*  And they both join me now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=17.72s)]
*  Mary, I think you guys have gotten a little time to look over this indictment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=19.16s)]
*  Your thoughts on what you've read. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=23.52s)]
*  Well, it's a very familiar conspiracy to me, having, like you mentioned, been part of a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=26.52s)]
*  team of lawyers that litigated against the Wisconsin fraudulent electors and two Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=32.32s)]
*  attorneys. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=37.28s)]
*  And so one of the things I was looking for in there, our case resolved with a settlement [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=38.28s)]
*  which included permanent injunctive relief. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=42.64s)]
*  The electors are never to do this again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=44.92s)]
*  The attorneys are never to help them do it again. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  But it also resulted in the release of some 1,500, 1,600 emails and text messages that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=49.74s)]
*  show the genesis of the scheme. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=56.46s)]
*  And what I saw in this Arizona indictment is a lot of the things I saw in those text [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  messages. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  So this scheme was concocted in Wisconsin by Trump campaign attorney Jim Troupis and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=64.62s)]
*  his friend Ken Chesbro. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=70.18s)]
*  Yes, Kenneth Chesbro, who has been pleaded guilty in Georgia, who is unindicted co-conspirator [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=71.98s)]
*  number four in this Arizona indictment. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=78.74s)]
*  He is the one who came up with the idea. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=82.42s)]
*  He had the beginnings of the idea just five days after the election. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=84.7s)]
*  His first email to Mr. Troupis saying, you know, what about if an alternate slate of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=88.22s)]
*  electors shows up on January 6th, throwing things into chaos, unless the state legislatures [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=94.1s)]
*  then decide who the slate should be? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=100.38s)]
*  Or we could throw such things into such chaos that the vote would go to the House. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=102.66s)]
*  And what that means is the vote by the House under the 12th Amendment, when there's no [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=107.52s)]
*  winner, means every state gets one vote. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=111.52s)]
*  It's not all 450 legislate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  And one at that time, it was a 26 state majority. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=116.88s)]
*  And that would have meant the election went to Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  So what I saw then in this indictment is the communications after Mr. Troupis sent these [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  memos that he asked Mr. Chesbro to write up to the White House. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=129.4s)]
*  That's reflected in this indictment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=132.7s)]
*  Then said, hey, can you replicate this in the other states? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=135.48s)]
*  And that's what set Mr. Chesbro off. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  It again, unindicted co-conspirator number four in this indictment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=142.6s)]
*  I'm certain based on the allegations in the indictment to working so closely with people [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  like Kelly Ward and also attorneys in Arizona, like Jack Wilencheck, to make this happen [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=151.16s)]
*  in Arizona. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=158.32s)]
*  Tom, when you worked on the January 6th committee and helped draft that final report, did you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=159.72s)]
*  think when you were working on the committee that there would be downstream effects of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=165.0s)]
*  state criminal investigations happening after your committee's work? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, I think there should have been these downstream effects. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the bottom line is this is conspiracy that cut across seven states, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=177.72s)]
*  Trump and his co-conspirators tried to steal or nullify the electoral votes from seven [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=182.24s)]
*  states because they lost the popular vote in the Trump lost the popular vote in those [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  states. This is now the third state Arizona is where they brought criminal charges against [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=190.08s)]
*  the co-conspirators, although not Trump himself. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=195.24s)]
*  And when I was reading this indictment, Chris, to me, it reads like a middle of the road [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=197.36s)]
*  indictment. So remember, in Georgia, you have the Rico conspiracy case where all the way [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=201.68s)]
*  up to Trump is charged in Georgia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=206.28s)]
*  In Michigan, you have these charges brought against just the fake electors, but none of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=208.36s)]
*  the co-conspirators that let them down that path. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=212.4s)]
*  Now here in Arizona, you have the fake electors charge plus these co-conspirators on top of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  them, including a number of the people who actually brought them, you know, led them [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=219.32s)]
*  down this false path. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=223.72s)]
*  Except for Ken Chesbrough, who Mary notes is an unindicted co-conspirator, he is conspicuously [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  not indicted here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=229.44s)]
*  And yet it's his memos really did lay the groundwork for the fake electors scheme. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=230.64s)]
*  You know, in fact, on the select committee, one of the things I learned after the fact [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=234.2s)]
*  is how much evidence Ken Chesbrough and his co-conspirators were able to hide from us. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  They hid a they had a December 6th, 2020 memo in which Chesbrough made it very clear [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=241.96s)]
*  that the intent of the fake electors had nothing to do with being contingent on election [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=247.36s)]
*  litigation outcomes or state legislatures flipping the vote, which of course, Trump and his [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=252.0s)]
*  associates were pressuring states to do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=255.96s)]
*  But in fact, was basically there to gum up the joint session of Congress on January 6th. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=258.0s)]
*  So this is, I think, necessary for this type of criminal, hopefully criminal accountability [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=261.6s)]
*  in Arizona and hopefully other states will follow suit. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=267.2s)]
*  Yeah, we should just note, and if folks don't remember this, that there were sort of different [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=269.76s)]
*  incarnations of the fake electors scheme, the first of which I think you could characterize [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=274.32s)]
*  as an extremely aggressive but arguably defensible legal posture to retain the possibility of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=279.56s)]
*  a Donald Trump victory if fraud was found and litigation proved effective. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=290.16s)]
*  The second version was just purely a bad faith, cynical enterprise to essentially defraud [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=294.44s)]
*  people and to create this sort of screwed up situation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=299.96s)]
*  Tom. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=303.68s)]
*  But Chris, can I just interject real quick? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=304.64s)]
*  The bottom line is that when you go through the evidence very carefully, the truth is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=306.36s)]
*  that first option was off the table by the time the fake electors met and voted. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=309.4s)]
*  The documents that Chesbrough and his co-conspirators were authoring and talking about, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  it was clearly aimed at delaying or obstructing the certification of Joe Biden's victory at [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=318.12s)]
*  the joint session of Congress. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  This is crucially important because what's happened here, you can even see this in the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=323.88s)]
*  indictment that came out today, some of the defendants lied about it and said, well, you [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=327.04s)]
*  know, we just voted in case election litigation flipped Arizona. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=330.52s)]
*  Now, some of the fake electors may very well believe that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=334.44s)]
*  The problem is we know the people who are pulling the marionette strings on them did [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=337.36s)]
*  not believe that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=341.08s)]
*  And that's why this indictment in Arizona is so important because they're going upstream, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=341.8s)]
*  going after some of the puppet masters, not just the fake electors. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=345.36s)]
*  By the way, as we roll this tape of that meeting, if you can roll that again, the B [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=348.44s)]
*  roll that we just had, which is a December 14th, 2020, Kelly Ward is the one who's sitting [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  at the chair position there in blue. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=356.68s)]
*  Again, this was all public. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  It's remarkable how much of the evidence, there's a fair amount of evidence in the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=361.56s)]
*  indictment itself, it's public. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=365.24s)]
*  You know, you've got Samuel Morehead who's writing, we need to take some action about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=370.64s)]
*  I advocate in Arizona, the legislator decertify the slate of Biden electors and certify the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=371.72s)]
*  slate of Trump electors. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=376.16s)]
*  I would hate to go to my grave knowing the electoral vote I cast was not counted. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=377.16s)]
*  They were doing this in public. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=381.16s)]
*  And to your point, Mary, I just want to read again from the indictment. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=382.88s)]
*  We haven't been able to work up graphics, so I will I will go slowly. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=385.56s)]
*  One of the things they catch here on page 29, the indictment is is sort of in an email [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=389.32s)]
*  to the Tea Party Phoenix Metro E-mail listserv. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=395.32s)]
*  They say, by the way, to your point about they knew what they were doing, if the electoral [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=400.4s)]
*  college doesn't result in 270 electoral votes for either presidential candidate, the 12th [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=405.28s)]
*  Amendment is exercise. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=409.6s)]
*  And guess what? Trump wins because the House didn't go the way Dems counted it going. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=410.72s)]
*  And our republic is saved from the globalists. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=414.76000000000005s)]
*  So this was all this is all laid out. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=418.04s)]
*  There's not again. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  They were not like that, Sarah Tish's about this entire enterprise. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=422.16s)]
*  It's all fairly well documented, Marion. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=425.92s)]
*  That's not always the case with with most criminal conspiracies, but this one, it's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=428.48s)]
*  fairly public. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=433.12s)]
*  Yes. And like Tom said, you know, I think, you know, it's possible that some of the fake [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=434.12s)]
*  electors in different states at first really did think that there was some legal authority. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=437.96s)]
*  I mean, they have lawyers telling them to do this right and that there was some legal [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=443.08s)]
*  authority. But it's clear when you see the documents by as Tom referred to them as the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=447.24s)]
*  puppet masters or the or the Marionette, you know, those pulling the Marionette strings, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=452.8s)]
*  they all along. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=458.12s)]
*  And it's clear in the documentation that they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=459.88s)]
*  And knew this scheme was just a scheme to throw things into chaos, to support putting [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=464.2s)]
*  pressure on the state legislatures to go ahead and just reconvene and send up a state, a [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=469.28s)]
*  slate of electors, which itself would have been subject to legal challenge, of course, or [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=474.44s)]
*  then to pressure Mike Pence to count these illegitimate votes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  And worse comes to worse, like you just said, through things to the 12th Amendment. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=482.96s)]
*  But I'll say even with the fraudulent electors, even if they might have some of them at the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=486.96s)]
*  beginning thought, hmm, maybe this is a legit scheme. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=491.52s)]
*  As Tom said, by the time they voted, they did not. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=494.88s)]
*  Yet even even after that, we had in Wisconsin [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  someone from the Republican Party flying out to D.C. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  on January 5th to try to make sure that that fraudulent slate got to Mike Pence. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=506.76s)]
*  And in one of her texts, she says, I feel like a drug dealer. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=512.28s)]
*  Lol. Wow. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=516.16s)]
*  Yeah. And it wasn't it wasn't that also where like someone passed the list to Ron Johnson [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=518.2800000000001s)]
*  to get to Mike Pence and he was he was the one carrying it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=522.2800000000001s)]
*  The senator from Wisconsin was like, I don't know, someone gave me something I was just [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  giving to the vice president. I don't really know. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=528.84s)]
*  You know, someone gives you a Ziploc bag, you carry it over to the vice president, whatever [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=531.32s)]
*  it's got to be. Can I can I just say this, Tom, that the other thing that strikes me [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  here, two questions, one is, and I'm pulling this from memory, if I'm not mistaken, I [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=540.36s)]
*  believe of the seven states, New Mexico is one of those states somewhat weirdly. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think two of the states, the language of the thing they certified had some kind [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=546.88s)]
*  of legal hedge where they said something like I think in Pennsylvania and New Mexico, I [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  may not be remembering this correctly. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  They basically said something along the lines, if the litigation proves successful, yada, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=559.32s)]
*  yada and the other ones, there is no hedge. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  It's straightforward, a lie of a fraudulent certification signed a line saying we are [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=564.32s)]
*  the proper electors here. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=570.2s)]
*  That's exactly right. So five of the seven states had no contingency language whatsoever. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=572.4000000000001s)]
*  For the fake electors, Arizona being one of them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=576.8399999999999s)]
*  And in fact, we know subsequently there was a text exchange from some of the conspiracy [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=579.04s)]
*  including Michael Roman and Kenneth Chesbrough. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  Roman, who I believe is indicted in this indictment and Ken Chesbrough, who is an unindicted [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  co-conspirator, where they're talking about this, they're talking about, hey, you know, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=590.04s)]
*  should we include this language that basically is a hedge on the fake electoral certificates? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  And Mike Roman says, F these people. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=597.92s)]
*  In other words, we're not doing it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=600.0s)]
*  We're not putting this language on the other ones, because if we do, then maybe people [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  start to question what they're doing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=604.04s)]
*  That's what I mean by puppet masters, right? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, some of these guys knew exactly what they were doing. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=607.92s)]
*  That's not to absolve all the fake electors themselves. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=610.16s)]
*  Some of them knew what they were doing, too, obviously. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=612.36s)]
*  Perhaps a lot of them did. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=615.04s)]
*  But the bottom line is that there's that this in the Trump campaign and the co-conspirators [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=616.24s)]
*  around Trump and Trump himself certainly knew that they were crossing all sorts of boundaries [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=620.68s)]
*  here, legal boundaries here in doing this. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=624.72s)]
*  And, you know, they were very cavalier in doing so. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=626.56s)]
*  And they didn't care about people downstream who were willing to do their bidding for them. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=629.36s)]
*  And that's really part of the story here as well. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP_GMohGpA&t=632.8s)]
