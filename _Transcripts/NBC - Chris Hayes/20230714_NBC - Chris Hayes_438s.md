# ‘Desperate’: Ohio Republicans pull ‘brazen stunt’ to undermine abortion rights
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M)
*  In Ohio, early voting began this week in a rare and, frankly, onerous August election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=0.0s)]
*  that was shoved onto the calendar by the state's gerrymandered Republican legislature. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  It is a last-minute, desperate attempt by Republican lawmakers to stop their own voters [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=10.6s)]
*  from approving a fall election day ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=16.6s)]
*  into the Ohio state constitution. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=21.7s)]
*  This August ballot measure, a few months before then, would raise the threshold needed to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=24.48s)]
*  pass constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60 percent, meaning that if this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=29.1s)]
*  one is successful, which they're hoping to sort of sneak past people, then the abortion [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=34.4s)]
*  rights amendment that's going to be on the ballot in the fall would have to win over [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  60 percent of the vote as opposed to a simple majority. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=42.1s)]
*  Not long ago, these same Republicans-declined August elections voted to ban, effectively, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=45.94s)]
*  most of them, but there are no lengths to which they will not go to make sure that every [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  woman who gets pregnant in Ohio is forced to give birth. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=55.26s)]
*  David Pepper is a former chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, author of the new book Saving [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  Democracy, a user's manual for every American. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=63.9s)]
*  He's been chronicling all the ongoing anti-democratic efforts of Republicans in Ohio and states [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=66.34s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=70.94s)]
*  David, great to have you on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=71.94s)]
*  I continue to think this is one of the most sort of like bald-faced, brazen stunts that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=74.02s)]
*  any Republican legislature has pulled. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=79.97999999999999s)]
*  How are things going with what's now called issue one in your state? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=82.04s)]
*  It is bold-faced. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  And what we're seeing here is a Republican Party that's gotten away with lawlessness [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=88.48s)]
*  for the last couple of years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=91.64s)]
*  And as we see everywhere in the country, when someone or some entity feels no accountability [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  for being lawless, they double down, they triple down, and that's what this is. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  The first week of early vote is underway, and it seems to be off to a good start. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing in more Democratic-leaning counties that we presume will be more likely to vote [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  no five and 10 times the turnout of last August in more rural Republican-leaning counties. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=111.76s)]
*  It's been two to four times maybe. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  So clearly, people, you know, the whole point of an August election for them was do it when [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=120.12s)]
*  no one's paying attention, do it when people are offering summer break or something. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  And the good news is people are working incredibly hard to basically knock on every door, make [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=129.56s)]
*  every phone call, send postcards so that people are seeing what this is and how, as you say, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=134.5s)]
*  latent and attempted is to basically lock in the minority rule when it comes to this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=141.56s)]
*  November beyond. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=145.76s)]
*  And it seems to at least be off to a good start now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=147.16s)]
*  People, again, it's not August 8th, the election. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=149.76s)]
*  It's between now and August 8th. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  The more that people vote early, the better. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=154.28s)]
*  And it's off to a decent start. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=156.12s)]
*  So for the folks that are—it is called issue one, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=159.76s)]
*  So the folks that want to keep abortion banned or ban abortion in Ohio want a yes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  The folks that want to keep that threshold at 50 percent are voting no. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  And I was wondering how the yes folks, right, the opponents of abortion rights and people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=172.44s)]
*  are trying to push to make it harder to amend the Constitution, we're going to message it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=176.52s)]
*  because at one level saying make it hard to amend the Constitution is going to be hard [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=180.12s)]
*  messaging. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=183.8s)]
*  And then if you go to the real issue, right, abortion, that's going to be hard messaging. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=184.8s)]
*  So I was not surprised to see that this is one of the ads that the pro issue one folks [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=188.52s)]
*  are running about, of course, trans folks. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=193.4s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  We saw messaging like this on Michigan when they had a state constitutional amendment [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  on abortion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=221.44s)]
*  What do you think of those ads? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=222.44s)]
*  I don't even understand how that has any relevance to the issue one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=225.44s)]
*  Here's the problem for them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=228.92s)]
*  Like, not only is abortion at 60 percent in Ohio like Iowa, so they can't talk about it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=229.92s)]
*  They literally had a polling call that someone leaked and they said, whatever we do, don't [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=235.64s)]
*  make out an abortion. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  But the other thing they're trying to do, we think about is they're trying to convince [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  a group of people, Ohioans, to take power from themselves and give it to politicians [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=245.28s)]
*  who happen to be most corrupt politicians in the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=251.0s)]
*  That's a really hard thing to ask. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=255.04s)]
*  Most people in America right now aren't exactly excited to give more power to politicians. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=256.04s)]
*  So they can't run on what they're doing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=261.52s)]
*  So it's got to be one lie after the next. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=263.96s)]
*  Or an ad like that, which is totally changing the subject, has nothing to do with what's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=266.72s)]
*  on the ballot in August. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=271.6s)]
*  So they really are stuck without a message. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=272.68s)]
*  And I think that's why you see some of the officials behind this are lashing out right [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=274.8s)]
*  now because I think it's not going very well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=279.12s)]
*  The ads are absurd because the heart of their argument is offensive. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=281.64s)]
*  And this is why we're seeing Kasich, Bob Taft, the Libertarian Party and others all coming [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=285.76s)]
*  together and saying, even if they happen to be against abortion access, this is crazy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=291.64s)]
*  This is absolutely undemocratic. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=296.88s)]
*  And so we see this broad coalition against it because, as you said, it's so aggressive, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=298.96s)]
*  it's so illegitimate, and it's been done in such an inappropriate way, scheduling on [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=303.52s)]
*  a date that they made illegal only months ago. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=308.28s)]
*  You just called it one of the most corrupt state houses in the country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=311.64s)]
*  And of course, that's always very, very competitive category. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=314.88s)]
*  But if I'm not mistaken, the former Republican speaker of the Ohio House, if I'm not mistaken, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  was recently sentenced to quite a long sentence for a big corruption conviction. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=323.64s)]
*  Yeah, he just got sentenced to 20 years two weeks ago or three weeks ago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=327.44s)]
*  So they are literally asking, as the biggest bribery scandal in Ohio history plays out, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=332.68s)]
*  Hey, why don't we give those people more power? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=337.8s)]
*  And why don't we lock the politicians and why don't we lock the voters of Ohio more [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=339.88s)]
*  out of their government so they can hold the most corrupt state house accountable? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=345.32s)]
*  By the way, when I say that, it's not me saying it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=349.36s)]
*  That was the headline in USA Today a couple of years ago when this bribery scandal first [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=351.84s)]
*  broke. That's what the FBI considered the most corrupt state house in the country right [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=356.56s)]
*  here in Ohio. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=360.96s)]
*  There's been not one reform to actually improve the ethics or lawlessness, lawfulness of Ohio's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=362.32s)]
*  state house since that scandal. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=368.92s)]
*  The only actually make them even less accountable than before, even though before is what led [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=371.08s)]
*  to the largest bribery scandal in the history of Ohio. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=377.28s)]
*  So special interests are lining up to support this thing because they know this will mean [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  they have more of a lock on the state house and the people who don't like what they're [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  doing can do less about it than they could than they can today if this thing passes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=388.24s)]
*  Really is an audacious thing to just shove this thing in August, say vote to raise the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=394.16s)]
*  threshold to 60 percent. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=398.8s)]
*  I just I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this, but we'll see what the voters [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=400.04s)]
*  of Ohio think about it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=405.0s)]
*  I was just saying they're just saying take away your own power while we maintain the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  corrupt system we have. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=411.24s)]
*  It's a terrible argument, which is why you have the absurd ad you just showed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  They have to change the subject. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCdRwpJt-2M&t=415.72s)]
