Video Description: State Representative James Talarico (D-TX) on AG Ken Paxton: “He’s learns from the best. Donald Trump is his mentor, his biggest supporter, so he’s going to throw everything but the kitchen sink in order to divert from the issue at hand, which is his corruption and the fact that his own party is finally going to hold him accountable for it.”

# Impeached Texas AG Ken Paxton tries out Trump defense playbook
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY)
*  He put the interest of himself above the laws of the state of Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=0.0s)]
*  He put the interest of himself over the established laws, policies, and procedures of the office [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=6.8s)]
*  of the attorney general. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=12.18s)]
*  He put the interest of himself over his staff, who tried to advise him on multiple occasions [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=14.5s)]
*  that he was about to violate the law. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=20.1s)]
*  Over the holiday weekend, Ken Paxton, who is perhaps the most notorious state attorney [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=23.36s)]
*  general in the nation, was impeached. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=27.3s)]
*  It was done by his own party in the Texas State House. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=29.4s)]
*  And for anyone who's followed his career, it's been a long time coming. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=31.8s)]
*  I mean, Paxton is basically an ethical train wreck. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=35.4s)]
*  He's been under indictment for felony securities fraud for eight years. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=39.3s)]
*  Nearly three years ago, seven top aides and deputy aides accused their boss of bribery [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=43.0s)]
*  and abuse of office. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=47.68s)]
*  He then fired several of them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=48.84s)]
*  They filed a whistleblower lawsuit that included accusations involving a campaign donor and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  a renovation of Paxton's home. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=54.68s)]
*  But Ken Paxton's way of protecting himself is basically the same as Donald Trump's, which [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=57.64s)]
*  is, I'm taking on the lives, so I'm your hero. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=61.36s)]
*  And so he tried to rally his allies ahead of the impeachment vote. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=65.08s)]
*  Ted Cruz called the whole thing a travesty and none other than Donald Trump called to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=68.56s)]
*  free Ken Paxton. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=73.2s)]
*  But it did not work. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=75.56s)]
*  Part of the reason it didn't work is because the story Paxton and his supporters are trying [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=76.56s)]
*  to tell here is the whole thing is some deep state plot by Republicans who are hand in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=80.0s)]
*  glove with liberals. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=84.12s)]
*  What have you done to anger these establishment liberal Republicans? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  Look, I've angered ever since I was in the Texas House, I ended up running against Joe [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  Strauss, who was a Republican speaker. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  And you know, when you expose what these liberal Republicans do, which is basically cut deals [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  with liberal Democrats, they get really angry that the last thing they want is somebody [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=102.48s)]
*  around like me who exposes what they do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=107.28s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=110.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=111.76s)]
*  Doesn't Matt Gaetz have another job? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=112.76s)]
*  Why is he on the left side of the screen? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=116.36s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  It's a little hard to tell the story that Matt Gaetz, Newsmax host and Ken Paxton are [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  trying to tell when you're talking about the state House Republicans in Texas who are among [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  the most right wing legislators of almost any state in the union. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=129.76s)]
*  And over half of them voted to impeach him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  So now Ken Paxton is suspended as attorney general and will face a trial in the Texas [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=135.88s)]
*  Senate where one of the people who could be sitting in judgment of him is his own wife, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=139.92s)]
*  Texas State Senator Angela Paxton. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=144.6s)]
*  Texas State Representative James Talerico is a Democrat serving the Texas House and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  he joins me now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=151.48s)]
*  I guess first, what was it like this weekend being a part of this? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Chris, thanks for having me on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=157.28s)]
*  This is probably the most consequential vote that I'm going to cast as a member of the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=160.88s)]
*  Texas Legislature. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=165.24s)]
*  Removing a statewide elected official is no small matter. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=167.2s)]
*  I know all of my colleagues put a lot of thought into this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=170.96s)]
*  As you mentioned, Ken Paxton's record of corruption is pretty clear and pretty egregious, but [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=173.88000000000002s)]
*  it was still no small thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  And so it was a historic moment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=183.12s)]
*  And I really couldn't be prouder of my colleagues in both political parties for coming together [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=184.72s)]
*  and holding a corrupt official accountable. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=190.08s)]
*  I have to say, I've followed Texas politics relatively closely for years and followed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  Paxton and their interesting Texas Republican statehouse politics are particularly interesting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=199.4s)]
*  because they face no big Democratic challengers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=203.88s)]
*  There's enormous bloody factional fights between them all the time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=206.6s)]
*  So like that that kind of thing isn't new. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=210.6s)]
*  But I don't quite get Paxton has been the same guy doing the same stuff for years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=212.88s)]
*  Like what happened here? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=218.4s)]
*  So there's one particular thing that happened. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=221.0s)]
*  So you mentioned those eight top lieutenants in the attorney general's office who blew the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  whistle on Ken Paxton using his office to benefit a campaign donor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=228.04s)]
*  And Ken Paxton settled with those eight lieutenants for three point three million dollars. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=233.0s)]
*  But since he committed his crimes in his official capacity, that three point three million dollars [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=238.72s)]
*  fell to the taxpayers of Texas to pay. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=244.12s)]
*  And that's when our state legislature got involved because we were being asked to appropriate [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=247.26s)]
*  his settlement in our state budget. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  That's when the investigation began back in March. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  He also accused there's a sort of open warfare between the House Speaker, Dave Phelan and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=258.0s)]
*  Ken Paxton. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=263.04s)]
*  He accused the speaker of the Texas House Republican of being drunk on the job. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=264.04s)]
*  We did play that clip of him very noticeably slurring his words the other night while gaveling [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=268.6s)]
*  over proceedings. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=274.16s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=276.48s)]
*  You know, I think it's it's no coincidence that Ken Paxton started throwing these allegations [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=279.64s)]
*  around the day that the General Investigating Committee in the House released their impeachment [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=283.8s)]
*  charges. He's trying to divert. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=289.12s)]
*  He learns from the best. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=291.08s)]
*  And Donald Trump is his mentor, his biggest supporter. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  And so he's going to throw everything but the kitchen sink in order to divert from the real issue at hand, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=297.36s)]
*  which is his corruption and the fact that his own party is going to finally hold him accountable for it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmxXqn_-mY&t=302.84s)]
