# Ron Klain: Judge the president by the results he produces
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA)
*  One way of looking at the debt ceiling deal the House approved yesterday, which the Senate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=0.0s)]
*  is expected to vote on as early as tonight, is that one of the biggest possible threats, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=3.88s)]
*  both an economic threat to the country and a political threat to the Biden presidency, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=8.88s)]
*  is about to be removed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=12.8s)]
*  It's a process that got us there was maddening and totally unnecessary. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Right now we have an economy that appears to be showing incredible resilience, inflation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=18.8s)]
*  coming down, the worst of a possible banking crisis apparently and hopefully behind us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=22.96s)]
*  Although we'll know more after the May jobs report tomorrow, the latest numbers showed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=28.16s)]
*  unemployment tied for the lowest rate in decades, with wages and benefits up crucially. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=31.6s)]
*  The last thing the country needed was a self-induced black swan event where we defaulted for the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=37.68s)]
*  first time in American history. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=42.2s)]
*  Now it looks like that's not going to happen, which is an enormous deal from the perspective [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=44.66s)]
*  of the Biden administration's chief goal to get an economy that is working on all cylinders [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  as we come out of a devastating global pandemic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=53.6s)]
*  Ron Klain served as the White House chief of staff during the first two years of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=56.599999999999994s)]
*  Biden administration as it fought to dig us out from the effects of COVID. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=59.4s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=62.919999999999995s)]
*  Ron, it's great to have you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=64.16s)]
*  It's great to be here, Chris. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=66.36s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=67.36s)]
*  What were you thinking as someone who spent a lot of time in that White House and worked [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=68.36s)]
*  with the Senate and the House when you weren't doing kind of opposition party negotiations [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=71.36s)]
*  about how this deal came together? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=78.0s)]
*  Well, I think, look, I think, as you said, the hostage, which was the U.S. economy, was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=81.48s)]
*  spared, and I think that's a win for the American people. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=87.48s)]
*  I think that, you know, there was no way to do this without getting the House to pass [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=95.08s)]
*  There was no way to get it on the floor of the House without the Speaker being willing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=96.08s)]
*  to put it on the floor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  And so there had to be concessions to him. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  And that's just the result of the 2022 elections. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=102.48s)]
*  But as you said, we have the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years in this country, the lowest [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=105.76s)]
*  black unemployment rate in the history of this country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=110.44s)]
*  You know, people at the bottom starting to make a little more money, starting to close [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=112.44s)]
*  the gap between prices and their wages, starting to see inflation come down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=116.44s)]
*  Price of gas is down more than a dollar from a year ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  So the economy is gaining traction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  We're seeing growth. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  There's been talk about recession for months. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  You turn on CNBC, all you hear about is people predicting recessions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=128.12s)]
*  If the economy is not in recession, we have a very strong jobs market up and down the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  scale. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=136.28s)]
*  And a lot of people have been left behind before. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=137.48s)]
*  And the last thing we needed was to blow that all up with a default that would throw markets [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=140.32s)]
*  into turmoil and would cost experts say at least a million jobs the first two weeks of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=143.55999999999997s)]
*  the default. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  And so sparing those people their jobs, sparing the economy, that's good for the country as [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  a whole. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=155.32s)]
*  There's some interesting sort of color on this that about the approach here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=156.32s)]
*  A few things. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  One, that Mitch McConnell advised to get shrink the room that it should just basically be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  Biden and McCarthy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=168.84s)]
*  And also the White House officials sought to downplay what they privately consider to be [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  substantial victory. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  Headline from Politico just don't boast how Biden world sought to ace the debt ceiling [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=175.72s)]
*  standoff. It is interesting to me that this president, there's a lot of times when people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=179.96s)]
*  will urge this president to use the bully pulpit and he doesn't use it in a way that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  strikes me as a strategic choice, whether it's the correct choice or not. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=190.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, I think there's difference between not using the bullet pulpit and gloating about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  a deal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=198.72s)]
*  The president did, I think, speak quite forcefully about the need. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=199.72s)]
*  If you're serious about reducing the deficit, serious about reducing the debt, we need to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  really work on revenues. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=205.76s)]
*  And he talked about that repeatedly in the spring and early summer this year about his [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=207.56s)]
*  plans to repeal some of the Trump tax cuts for the richest people in the country, but [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  his plan to have a tax on billionaires. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=216.04s)]
*  And the Republicans made it very clear they were not going to go for any taxes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  They were going to protect billionaires at all costs. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=223.28s)]
*  And so he couldn't get that done in any kind of negotiation with House Republicans. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=225.96s)]
*  I think he was forceful on that, but they just wouldn't go there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=230.88s)]
*  Just like the president wouldn't, no matter what McCarthy said, the president wouldn't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=233.16s)]
*  cut Social Security, president wouldn't cut Medicare, wouldn't cut Medicaid. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  The president wasn't going to give up his student loan relief plan. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that each side had some red lines. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  The Republicans would move off their red lines. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  The president didn't move off his red lines. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  As a result, we got a deal that, you know, basically avoids the default and doesn't do [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=252.04s)]
*  that much harm to our economic growth. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=259.8s)]
*  If I'm in the White House right now, on the domestic policy front, not on the international [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  policy front, the domestic policy front, the thing that I'm looking at from a political [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=266.96s)]
*  and substantive perspective, because I think the incentives are aligned, right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's good for the country, it will be good for the president politically. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=278.76s)]
*  But the thing that I'm looking at is the economy, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'm just curious how you think this is true, because you're sitting on that Weiss [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  is like, you can't really control whether the Fed hikes rates. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=285.92s)]
*  You can't really, like, what you could do, you've done, right? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=288.92s)]
*  You've avoided some big catastrophe or the debt ceiling deal. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=292.92s)]
*  You've done all the fiscal stimulus, the ARP, you've done all these things. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=294.92s)]
*  Now you just got to sit there and hope we get a soft landing, basically, which is going [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=297.92s)]
*  to decide the fate of both millions of Americans and the president's political fate. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=301.92s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=305.92s)]
*  I don't agree, Chris. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=306.92s)]
*  It's not just sitting and watching. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=307.92s)]
*  The president passed major legislation in 2022. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=309.68s)]
*  What they have to do this year is start to implement it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=311.68s)]
*  So we got the infrastructure bill. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=314.68s)]
*  Seven thousand projects started last year. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=316.68s)]
*  There are more than twenty thousand projects starting this year. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=318.68s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=320.68s)]
*  They'll create jobs and long term economic growth. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=321.68s)]
*  The Chips and Science Act, which is creating manufacturing jobs that provide six figure [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=323.68s)]
*  incomes to people even if they don't have a four year college degree. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=327.68s)]
*  It's going to change this country. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=330.68s)]
*  It's going to make us lose our dependence on foreign ships and take control of our own [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=331.68s)]
*  supply of these critical aspects of modern manufacturing and our high tech economy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=336.44s)]
*  It'll create a lot of great jobs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=341.44s)]
*  So they've got to get all these things going this year. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=343.44s)]
*  And those things will have impact on the economy and will make the president's legacy, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=345.44s)]
*  president's achievements concrete to people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=351.44s)]
*  They know he passed some bills. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=353.44s)]
*  They don't really know what they mean or what they'll do for them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=354.44s)]
*  This year is the year where you're going to start to see these things happen and it'll [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=357.44s)]
*  become much more concrete to people. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=360.44s)]
*  And already we're seeing the results of the Inflation Reduction Act with a massive expansion [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=363.2s)]
*  of solar projects, wind projects, the construction of electric battery factories in the country [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=367.2s)]
*  all over the country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=373.2s)]
*  We are moving dramatically on the creation of solar and wind and renewable power and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=374.2s)]
*  on the advancement of the U.S. as a leader in electric vehicles. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=379.2s)]
*  Final question. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=383.2s)]
*  I've asked you this before with the president today. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=384.2s)]
*  We have a speech with the believe it was the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=386.2s)]
*  He tripped. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=390.2s)]
*  You may have seen the footage literally over a sandbag that was somehow placed behind him. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=391.96s)]
*  Literally sandbagged. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=394.96s)]
*  It seemed to me, honestly, the kind of thing that would happen to anyone in that situation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=395.96s)]
*  But of course, you've already got people talking about the president's age, concerns [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=399.96s)]
*  about his age. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=403.96s)]
*  I know that you've worked with him. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=404.96s)]
*  His age is immutable, which is what makes it such a convenient attack, I think, for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=405.96s)]
*  people that don't want to be president because, like, there's no rebutting it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=409.96s)]
*  But what do you say to people who are concerned? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=412.96s)]
*  I say look at the results that this president is producing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=415.96s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act is a climate change bill. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  It's the most significant one passed on planet Earth. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  We were unable to do anything on climate change for decades in this country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  And now we've passed this legislation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  Look at the results he's produced in terms of low unemployment and bringing inflation [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  down, getting us past the pandemic, getting businesses back open, getting schools back [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  to open. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  The measure of this president is the results he produces every single day. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  And avoiding this dangerous default was the latest of those results. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  So you can judge the president by the results he's producing as president. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  I can tell you he is mentally sharp. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=449.48s)]
*  He is physically fit. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=450.48s)]
*  He, you know, obviously they put sandbags on the stage to hold things down because it [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=451.48s)]
*  was windy. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=455.48s)]
*  And he tripped over a little sandbags as he was jogging across the stage to greet some [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=456.48s)]
*  guests after he'd stood for hours and shook hands and saluted every single graduate of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=459.48s)]
*  the Air Force Academy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=463.88000000000005s)]
*  He is robust. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=464.88000000000005s)]
*  He's robust mentally. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=465.88000000000005s)]
*  He's robust physically. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  And what happened today could have happened to anyone who was up there moving across that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=469.0s)]
*  stage. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=473.0s)]
*  He also pardoned any of the disciplinary infractions from that class as well, which I think some [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=474.28s)]
*  were pretty happy about, Ron Klain. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=480.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wbKVw9bXA&t=481.48s)]
