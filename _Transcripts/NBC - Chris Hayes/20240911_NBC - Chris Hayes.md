# Sen. Booker reacts to Harris-Trump debate ‘She exposed him raw’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk)
*  After President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance that led him to leaving the race, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=0.0s)]
*  there was all this worry about whether Vice President Kamala Harris would make a strong [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=3.84s)]
*  presidential candidate. Those fears have proven to be unfounded. Harris completely owned the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=7.12s)]
*  debate last night, which people who know her said she would do even before she stepped foot on the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=13.6s)]
*  stage. I think that she's going to find very deft ways of coming forward and reminding people [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=19.2s)]
*  of the chaos, of the kind of crassness, of the kind of person that he is, but do it in a way [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=27.04s)]
*  that doesn't take her into the mud where Donald Trump loves to go, but do it in a way that simply [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  is straight with the American people and lets them come to the conclusions that to me are very obvious. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=39.52s)]
*  Now, I will admit, as Senator Cory Booker was saying all this last night on this very network, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  I was sitting at the table. I was thinking, I'm not sure you want to pump the fist before the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  debate happens, but clearly he knew what he was talking about. Sarah Cory Booker is a Democrat of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=54.96s)]
*  New Jersey. He's a longtime friend and ally of Vice President Kamala Harris. They also both sat [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=60.24s)]
*  on the Senate Judiciary Committee together. You see them there, and he joins me now. Yeah, Senator, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=65.04s)]
*  there's a weird thing that happens in the run-up to debates with these expectations games, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  you know, where people start to be like, oh, my opponent's the best debater and I am just a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=75.28s)]
*  humble slob and it's a little put on, but at the same time, both you and Gavin Newsom last night [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=79.84s)]
*  were like, she's so good. She's going to kill him. She's going to be so good. And I was thinking, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=85.36s)]
*  boy, it's already a lot of pressure on her, but you're right. What'd you think? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=89.76s)]
*  I mean, it was simply awesome. I sat next to her for years in high stakes judiciary hearings [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=95.84s)]
*  and watched how she rose to every single moment. Supreme Court Justice, Cabinet Secretary, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  you pitch to Kamala she's going to knock it out of the park when it really counts. And we know the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=108.88s)]
*  stakes were high for her going into it, but she is a gamer and she really brought it last night. And [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=113.6s)]
*  she brought it, as I said two nights ago, in a deft way. She found ways to, yes, bait him in and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=119.36s)]
*  expose him raw before everybody who just looked, no matter who you are, Democrat or Republican, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=126.24s)]
*  when you're talking about eating cats and dogs, you know, just let your opponent show his truth. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=132.8s)]
*  You know, the thing you said about her sort of this is a high stakes situation, she knocked it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  out of the park. What's been striking to me is I've interviewed the vice president a number of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=145.12s)]
*  times in the same way that I've interviewed you. I don't know her very well, but she's always been [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=149.68s)]
*  incredibly formidable and impressive. But as a sort of character testament, I mean, the amount [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=154.0s)]
*  of pressure that she's been on her, just as a person and as a politician, and at each [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=160.0s)]
*  point that that pressure she has had to respond to, navigate it, I just think speaks remarkably well [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=167.28s)]
*  to her ability to be a president, honestly, given that the job is a very pressure-packed job with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=175.76s)]
*  really high stakes and you really got to deliver in the moments that matter most. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=183.6s)]
*  Yeah, she really is a clutch player, and I think it does speak to her presidential capacities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  Look, you talk to Kamala, and this is what I've loved about her throughout this campaign, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  is she's not making this about her. Donald Trump, it was all about him, his fragile ego. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=199.52s)]
*  He couldn't resist trying to defend any attacks on that ego. For Kamala, it's about everybody else. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  And this is what I think I want people to really know about her right now, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  is she feels the urgency of the challenges before the American people. She feels very much the pain [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  of people who are facing the stripping away of their reproductive rights. She feels an economy [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=222.24s)]
*  which many people don't think works for them anymore in America. These are issues that drive [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=228.08s)]
*  her. She is about serving this country and knows that this is a moment not to beat Donald Trump, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  but really where we need leaders in the plural to rise and meet it so that we as a nation can come [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=240.4s)]
*  together and move forward. And I'm really honored really to watch a friend rise to this moment and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=245.6s)]
*  keep the spotlight where it needs to be on the American people. We should note that she's going [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=252.0s)]
*  to do the first post-debate event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in Luzerne County, of course, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=257.2s)]
*  key county in a key swing state. There's a bunch of, as we learned last night, 800,000 Polish [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=262.24s)]
*  Americans in the state of Pennsylvania. She was talking about Donald Trump sort of sucking up to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=269.52s)]
*  Putin and what it might mean for the nation. What do you think of the foreign policy back and forth [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=274.08s)]
*  between them? Because of course, she's the vice president of the United States, but you know, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=279.84s)]
*  it's hard to beat the experience just particularly, I think, for voters who don't [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  aren't in the weeds of someone who has already been president. Well, again, I think what she did [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=287.76s)]
*  last night was really important because Republicans and Democrats, I'm talking about the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=292.64s)]
*  Ronald Reagan Republicans who stood up to Russia, to the Kremlin, know how urgent the situation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=297.76s)]
*  in Ukraine are. I know that it's not just about Ukraine. It's really about democracy in Europe. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=305.68s)]
*  It's really about democracy writ large and the rule of law globally. She exposed Donald Trump for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=311.52s)]
*  being on the extremes of the Republican Party, someone who would capitulate to Putin, who would [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=318.4s)]
*  surrender against this totalitarian aims of Putin, who thinks might makes right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=323.84s)]
*  And so that was very powerful. And it's a message to a lot of Americans. I know in New Jersey, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=331.52s)]
*  we have a lot of Ukrainian and Polish Americans. In Pennsylvania and other key battleground states, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=335.76s)]
*  there are a lot of folks whose ancestry goes back to those Eastern European countries [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  who know about the horrors of totalitarian dictators and their ambitious territorial aims. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=346.08s)]
*  And so this was a—it was a—again, she gave a master's class last night in showing how you let [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=353.2s)]
*  your opponent expose themselves before all the country and see things that many of us have [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=359.44s)]
*  forgotten or he's found ways to hide. He got a chance to tell the truth about Donald Trump [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=365.68s)]
*  and let him often do the talking. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuNBnHu3Bk&t=372.0s)]
