Video Description: “You know that moment when you're watching a horror movie and a person goes down into the dark basement or out into the woods and you just instinctively yell, 'don't go down there!' Of course, they always go down there. Just like Republicans always do in the era of Donald Trump. One after another, they walk into his arms. You’re watching and everyone is warning, 'you probably don't want to do that. It’s not going to end up well.' Then they do and their careers seem to end in humiliating fashion. The latest example: the third shortest tenured speaker in American history, Kevin McCarthy.”

# McCarthy is the latest Republican abandoned by Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc)
*  You know that moment when you're watching a horror movie and a person goes down to the dark basement or out into the woods and you just instinctively yell, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=0.0s)]
*  don't go down there. Of course, they always go down there. Just like Republicans always do in the era of Donald Trump, one after another, they walk into his arms and you're watching and everyone's warning, you probably don't want to do that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=6.48s)]
*  It's not going to end up well. And they do. And then their careers seem to end in humiliating fashion. Latest example, the third shortest tenured speaker in American history, Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=17.64s)]
*  He outlasted only a man who held the gavel for one day and a man who died of tuberculosis. So he has that going for him. McCarthy, like many, many before him and like every other Republican, had his opportunity to cut loose from Trump after January six. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=29.16s)]
*  But with visions of the speakership in his head, he hopped on a plane just three weeks after the insurrection to the Florida retirement home when Trump was at his lowest to beg for an endorsement from a disgraced one term ex president. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=42.84s)]
*  But even that pilgrimage did not buy him much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=54.52s)]
*  No persons have received a majority of the whole number of votes cast by surname. A speaker has not been elected. A speaker has not been elected. Has not been elected. Has not been elected. A speaker has not been elected. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=58.92s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy of the state of California, having received a majority of the votes cast is duly elected speaker of the House of Representatives. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Hey, Kevin, not a boy. The outfit changes there, not because she was doing a kind of share sort of thing, but instead because it took several days. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  Just nine months after that excruciating week, McCarthy was kicked out of the same job by a bunch of Trump devoted magnolias while his good body. Donald did not lift a finger to help him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  And since then, he's been hanging around to the lamest of lame ducks, clearly seething with rage. So much so that he was accused of shoving another congressman in front of a reporter while denying reports that he was leaving. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=106.8s)]
*  You're not resigned. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=122.52s)]
*  So you'll stay the entire time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  So don't worry. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=126.6s)]
*  Yes, you will run. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=130.88s)]
*  Or you just keep the majority. I'm going to help people. I got here. We're going to expand it further. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=131.64s)]
*  Well, all that only announced today that, yeah, not only is he retiring, he's actually resigning. He's out of here. Done. Effective at the end of the month, leaving his successor with a three vote majority in the new year. Happy New Year. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=138.39999999999998s)]
*  Before two huge spending bill deadlines. As for McCarthy, he's heading to the political graveyard along the likes of Jeff Sessions and Paul Ryan and Mo Brooks, Mark Meadows and many, many others. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=152.92s)]
*  Claire McCaskill served two terms as the Democratic Senator for Missouri. She's an MSNBC political analyst and she joins me now. What do you think? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=164.84s)]
*  What did you notice when he's, are you going to run again? He went, yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=172.24s)]
*  He was like, I guess I can't make news on that because I'm clearly getting out of here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=177.08s)]
*  I can't say no. You know, I think the Republicans need to realize they've got a problem. Look at the history of speakers the Republican Party has produced and look at what has happened. Going back to Gingrich. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=183.6s)]
*  I mean, there's been scandal. Yeah. I mean, Ryan's the only one that legitimately served until the Democrats took over. Boehner got chased out in October after that election, the previous November. So meanwhile, Pelosi. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=196.6s)]
*  And by the way, I don't want anybody to say, well, the Democrats are easier to keep together. No, they're not. No, they're harder, I think, by all. Of course. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=211.76s)]
*  Or they're harder. There are structural factors that make them a more unwieldy coalition than the structural factors in the Republican Party. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=218.76s)]
*  Correct. But the difference is they really do want to govern and get things done. And so at moments when it matters, they stay together. And Pelosi was able to keep them together over some really rough waters. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=225.12s)]
*  And Hakeem Jeffries has done a great job this year keeping the Democrats together. Meanwhile, I mean, what's the shelf life of Mike Johnson? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I mean, this isn't going to go well. It's not going to go well because either he is going to bring the Republican Party down in flames next November or they're going to move him out, too. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=243.52s)]
*  We should we should. You mentioned Paul Ryan, who is another one who basically was forced into the job of speaker by Trump, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=256.72s)]
*  Went and walked a set of humiliating planks where he I mean, again, he was committed to the ideological cause of repealing Obamacare didn't work. But look at this. This is the Young Guns trailer for 2020. This is the former future of the Republican Party. Take a look. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=263.8s)]
*  There is a better way and the new team is ready to bring America back. Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan joined by common sense conservative candidates from across the country. Together, they are ready to make history. Together, they are the Young Guns. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=277.24s)]
*  I mean, now, 13 years, a long time politics lot happened, but all gone. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=304.12s)]
*  That entire universe of of what was going to be the Republican leadership of the Republican Party stood for Patrick McHenry, who's a sort of lieutenant of Kevin McCarthy, who served as on speaker. He's also leaving. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=308.12s)]
*  And you can also understand why why people wouldn't want to stick around in that majority. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, listen, it's not a pleasant place. You know, I talked to my friends that are still in office in Washington with some frequency, especially on the Senate side. It's not a pleasant place to be right now. It's really hard. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=326.76s)]
*  So if you believe in things, if you have an ideology other than the personality cult of Trump, it's very hard to stick around because clearly the Republican Party doesn't stand for anything right now other than Donald Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=338.6s)]
*  And that's got to be really hard. And by the way, those Young Guns, not only is McCarthy out in record time, not only is Paul Ryan gone and making big bucks on the board of Rupert Murdoch, but Cantor got beat. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=351.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, just beat beat. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=365.24s)]
*  Well, and he was and that when he was beat, he was beat by a guy named David Brad in a in a in a primary that sort of took everyone by surprise in a kind of sort of canary in the coal mine about Trump. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=367.32s)]
*  I mean, really, it was a pop. Your own voters hate you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=379.32s)]
*  The base, the Republican Party hates hates the people that they see as the GOP establishment. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  There is now just also a logistical issue that has, you know, when you speak about Mike Johnson, this is Marjorie Taylor Green doing her own vote counting. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  She's now sort of a proto whip. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, now in twenty twenty four, we will have a one seat majority in the House of Representatives. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  Congratulations, Freedom Caucus for one and one hundred and five rep who expel our own for the other. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  I can assure you Republican voters didn't give us the majority to crash the ship. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=406.92s)]
*  Hopefully, no one dies. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, the Kevin McCarthy elevated her. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=413.0s)]
*  Yes. I mean, this is not not a well woman. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  No, I mean, this is not someone who seemed to me. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=420.88s)]
*  It's well, in terms of our values and things I think most Americans believe in. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=423.16s)]
*  Yes, she is definitely out of the mainstream, way out of the mainstream. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=427.64000000000004s)]
*  Very much. And now she is like a pseudo spokesperson for the Republican Party. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=431.0s)]
*  She's like part of the running the Republican House. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=435.04s)]
*  She's talking about being vice president. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, her whole book is a is an homage to how she should be vice president under Donald Trump. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=439.12s)]
*  So and McCarthy empowered her. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=444.4s)]
*  Yeah, McCarthy lifted her up. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  And the fact that she's staying loyal to him, I guess in some quarters may seem admirable. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=448.96s)]
*  But it is scary to me that she gets the amount of tension she gets. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=453.36s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing, every time we go through it, I said it was like a horror movie in the beginning. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=458.08s)]
*  But it's just it's such a cliche. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  The devil's bargain. The devil's bargain is called the devil's bargain for a reason. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=463.28s)]
*  It is a trope of the Western literary canon in which you are offered a thing and then you're going to have to pay back worse in the end. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=466.2s)]
*  And we watch them do it over and over and over and over again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=472.44s)]
*  And eventually the devil comes calling as he has for Kevin McCarthy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=475.88s)]
*  Claire McCaskill. Thank you. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=478.64s)]
*  You bet. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d735X2E-8oc&t=479.88s)]
