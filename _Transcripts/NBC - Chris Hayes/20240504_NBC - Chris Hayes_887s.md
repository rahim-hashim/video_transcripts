# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights May 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM)
*  Olivia Nuzzi is a correspondent for New York Magazine where she has extensively covered [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=0.0s)]
*  Hope Hicks over the years, wrote a great profile for her. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=3.98s)]
*  Christian Greenberg is a former Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division for the U.S. Attorney's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=6.34s)]
*  Office in the Southern District of New York. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=9.78s)]
*  She was at the courthouse today and they both join me now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=11.38s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=13.66s)]
*  Let me start with you because you were at the courthouse and you walked in and got on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=14.66s)]
*  set and you were like, whoa, what a day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=18.06s)]
*  It felt, again, we're reading this in real time from people that are in the room. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=20.34s)]
*  We don't have cameras. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=23.66s)]
*  We don't have a transcript, but it felt that way, just getting the little text dispatches. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=24.66s)]
*  What was it like in that in that rebuilding? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=28.7s)]
*  It was incredibly powerful testimony from Hope Hicks because before she even got to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=31.1s)]
*  kind of the meat of it, she had said so many nice things about Donald Trump just to start. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=37.26s)]
*  You know, he's a master at branding. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=41.5s)]
*  He knows communications and like a lot of really kind of obsequious comments, you know, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=43.54s)]
*  in showing that she still cares for the guy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=49.14s)]
*  So then when she starts making these statements that are damning to the defense's case, it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=51.84s)]
*  has that much more power. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=57.84s)]
*  She's not like the sleazeball lawyer who's got the sleazy tabloid clients or the tabloid [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=59.2s)]
*  journalist like she's somebody who cared about him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=64.88s)]
*  And yet she is just you know, there was the nail in the coffin moment where in 2018, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=67.56s)]
*  there's a conversation that it's just her and Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=74.52s)]
*  He's the president of the United States at this point. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=77.6s)]
*  Yes, she's working for him in the White House. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=79.12s)]
*  Yes. And Michael Cohen says it has gone to the New York Times and said, out of the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=80.92s)]
*  goodness of my heart, right, I made this payment to Stormy Daniels. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=85.74s)]
*  And Donald Trump says, well, you know, this would have been really damaging if it had [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=88.98s)]
*  come out during the campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=94.38s)]
*  And it's good that it's coming out now and not then. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=96.22s)]
*  And that was the last question from the prosecutor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=98.7s)]
*  And it was just a mic drop moment, like jaw dropping moment that she had said that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=102.74s)]
*  So it was incredibly powerful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=107.42s)]
*  Just to follow up on that. And she started crying after she said that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=109.98s)]
*  Right. Like there all this sort of tension in her gets released at that point. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=113.06s)]
*  Exactly. Like at that point, she the cross examination starts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=115.72s)]
*  There's like a question or two about like, when did you start working at the Trump [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  organization? And that's when she starts crying. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=124.62s)]
*  I don't at least watching it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=126.62s)]
*  It did not seem like that was the question that made her cry. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=128.62s)]
*  I think it was the fact that she had just she knew she dropped this bomb and that the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=131.5s)]
*  weight of that really in that release, as you say, you could just see it in in her [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=136.94s)]
*  expression. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=142.14s)]
*  Livia, you've covered Hopix for a long time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  How central was she to the operation? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  How crucial a witness is she in this case? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  She was in proximity and and in every other way, as close as you could get to that family [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=150.96s)]
*  without having the last name Trump. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=156.72s)]
*  I think arguably she was much closer to Donald Trump than a lot of his own children. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=158.4s)]
*  She was probably edges out Tiffany. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=163.08s)]
*  Yeah, sadly, she was a lot closer than than a lot of the children. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  She was around all the time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  She started at the Trump organization and became very close to Ivanka and sort of built [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=170.94s)]
*  her reputation there in the family and then found herself. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  It's sort of this comical, almost like dark sitcom. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=179.7s)]
*  Donald Trump said, we're going to Iowa. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=183.5s)]
*  And she said, what do people wear in Iowa? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  She did not intend to work on a presidential campaign and did not intend to work in a White [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=187.33999999999997s)]
*  House. It was not her dream. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=192.06s)]
*  And yet she ended up there in this incredibly toxic, ultimately violent environment and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=193.38s)]
*  saw a lot and has a near photographic memory, even if that did not always come through in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=200.34s)]
*  her testimony. And I think it was probably very hard for Trump if he has emotions to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=204.72s)]
*  see her in that position. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=210.72s)]
*  She's not Michael Cohen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=212.08s)]
*  Yeah, there was a report. I mean, Lawrence said this when we play that in the open, there [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=213.4s)]
*  was sort of avoidance of eye contact. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  She said she hadn't talked to him since twenty twenty two. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=218.28s)]
*  It seems to me like there are two key parts of the prosecution's case that that Hicks [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=221.6s)]
*  helps the prosecution with. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=228.4s)]
*  One is, was this about the campaign? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=230.3s)]
*  Right. Because that's key to the motive. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=233.02s)]
*  And the other was, was this being done by other people or did Trump have a role? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=234.94s)]
*  And my understanding is the testimony spoke to both of those. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=240.3s)]
*  But on the second, you talked about the first one on the second one, like it's pretty clear from her [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=243.58s)]
*  testimony, at least according to her, that he was involved. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=247.86s)]
*  This was not an off book operation freelance by Michael Cohen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=250.18s)]
*  Exactly right. And so she talks about the fact that when the inquiry first comes out, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=253.86s)]
*  before the Wall Street Journal publishes that the National Enquirer is trying to squash this [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=258.62s)]
*  story about Karen McDougall, when that inquiry first comes in, Donald Trump goes to Hope Hicks [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=263.9s)]
*  and says, what did David Pecker tell you? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=269.5s)]
*  Right. And that's significant because he wants to make sure that David Pecker is sticking to the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=272.34s)]
*  story. This was a legitimate business contract with Karen McDougall. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=276.38s)]
*  We wanted her on the magazine cover. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=280.94s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that, you know, that he wanted to make sure that the contract, which just says [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=281.5s)]
*  that this was a legitimate business opportunity, promotional opportunity, that Pecker was telling that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  story because Hope Hicks is in the dark. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=291.08s)]
*  And then after the article is published, the Wall Street Journal, the Wall Street Journal, after [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=293.2s)]
*  it's published, this is now a few days before the election, November 4th, 2016, after the article is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=298.76s)]
*  published, what does Donald Trump say to Hope Hicks? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=304.28s)]
*  How's it playing? And that's what he would say whenever he wanted to find out how something was being [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=307.24s)]
*  received in the press. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=311.84s)]
*  Again, related to the election. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=313.28s)]
*  Now, she also testified, as you mentioned in the opening, that, you know, he said, maybe make sure the newspaper [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  doesn't go to Melania. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  And that's also fine. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=320.94s)]
*  Like, you can have both purposes so long as the campaign is front and center, which it clearly was and which [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  Hope Hicks testified that it was. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=328.5s)]
*  But again, like, his focus was also on getting David Pecker's phone number after the article came out. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=330.18s)]
*  He asked Hope Hicks, give me Pecker's phone number. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=336.70000000000005s)]
*  And then afterwards says, it's all good. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=339.94s)]
*  Like, we talked. It's all fine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=342.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=344.06s)]
*  So he's good, which is what Pecker testified. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=344.36s)]
*  How's our girl? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=346.8s)]
*  Again, yes, this corroboration of what we've already heard from from Pecker, again, showing Donald Trump is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  right in the center of this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=354.72s)]
*  And Hicks, part of what was fascinating to me, again, as I was sort of reading this through our internal [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=356.68s)]
*  Slack channel, is that, again, it was a reminder of the sheer chaos and crisis and almost tipping point moment [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=363.04s)]
*  of the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=368.92s)]
*  And the fact that that article that does come out before the election ultimately ends up spaced out enough that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  it wouldn't like if if that had come out the day after Planet Access Hollywood or two days after or three days, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=377.62s)]
*  like that could have been it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=384.26000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=385.82000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you were there covering it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=386.1s)]
*  That could have been it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=387.5s)]
*  Yeah, they got sort of lucky with the timing of that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=388.46000000000004s)]
*  And also remember at that time, it's easy to forget now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  I think I've repressed a lot of it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=393.22s)]
*  I think most Americans have. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=394.38s)]
*  It was one allegation after another. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=395.86s)]
*  It was more than two dozen allegations in the end of some sort of sexual misconduct or impiety. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=397.68s)]
*  And it was just one thing after another. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=403.44s)]
*  They're running against Hillary Clinton. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  It's not like they think that they're going to do well with women voters overall. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  But it's just this sort of torrent of negative information. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  And this is yet another thing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=414.12s)]
*  Let me ask you about the moment when Hope Hicks cried. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=415.88s)]
*  I understand you've been doing some reporting about that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, my understanding was, look, she did not want to testify. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  She was compelled to testify. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not as though she raised her hand and said, yes, I want to help ruin Donald Trump's life. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=425.46s)]
*  Right. This is someone who's been very important to her, even if she does maintain very [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=429.42s)]
*  complicated, conflicted feelings about him. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=433.98s)]
*  And my understanding was that being asked about the opportunities that he had given her in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=436.66s)]
*  her life sort of brought all of that back and made her very emotional that it was not a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=441.26s)]
*  direct response to the real. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=445.94s)]
*  Because that's how that's how the cross started. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=448.3s)]
*  Yes. Which is sort of a kind of like twisting the knife. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=450.58s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=452.74s)]
*  Like this guy that gave you everything you're up here testifying against. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=453.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  South Dakota's Republican governor, Kristi Noem, was so dead set on being Trump's vice [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  president. She didn't run against him in the primary, even though there was some talk that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  she might be a contender in that primary. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  Instead, she just launched herself directly into the Veepstakes, running that ad you just [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  saw during the first Republican primary debate on Fox News with the clear hope that Donald [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=473.36s)]
*  Trump would be watching and see him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=478.68s)]
*  The official South Dakota state website even published a press release announcing the ad [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  ran during the debate, just in case anyone missed it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=486.06s)]
*  Noem has been running multiple ads on Fox, again, ostensibly touting jobs in her state, but [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=488.94s)]
*  really touting herself. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=493.7s)]
*  And that campaign for the number two slot was supposed to kick off improper next week with [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=495.62s)]
*  the release of her new memoir, No Going Back. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=500.38s)]
*  Now, in Noem's defense, the book is generating her a bunch of headlines like, for instance, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  quote, Kristi Noem describes executing puppy she hated in New Book and, quote, South [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=507.5s)]
*  Dakota governor Kristi Noem defends her account of killing own dog in New Book. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=512.92s)]
*  And finally, quote, Kristi Noem's VP chances appear as dead as the dog she killed. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=517.28s)]
*  Now, I will admit, I am not a professional political consultant, but I'm pretty sure proud [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=522.96s)]
*  puppy killer is not what most Americans want from their vice president. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=526.56s)]
*  Tara Settmeyer worked as a Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, now senior [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=530.88s)]
*  advisor of the Lincoln Project. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=535.06s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=536.3s)]
*  Tara, I should just lay out her account is that she had a dog. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=538.3399999999999s)]
*  It was a hunting dog. It was a puppy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=541.86s)]
*  I think about 14 months, if I'm not mistaken, that it twice attacked animals. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=543.3399999999999s)]
*  And then she shot it in a gravel pit. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  She also shot a goat. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  And then there's a bunch of horses they had to put down. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=552.14s)]
*  Well, first, what do you what do you think about the politics of this? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=556.18s)]
*  I think the headlines you just ran speak for themselves. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=561.3s)]
*  I mean, Chris, these are horrible people. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=565.26s)]
*  They they're they're just awful. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=568.06s)]
*  Their nihilism and their bloodlust is pathological at this point, because really the cruelty is the point in MAGA. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  Right. And this is a perfect example of that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=579.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Kristi Noem can make any excuse she wants. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=582.26s)]
*  She can try and walk it back all she wants or blame it on the fake news media all she wants or blame it on her ghostwriter or the editors or the publishers. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=585.18s)]
*  But no, she made the choice to put this in her book, a book that she has already audio voice. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  There's an audio version of it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=598.6s)]
*  So she was well aware of what was all in it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  And she just made the decision to brag about being a puppy executioner. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=602.8s)]
*  It's sadistic. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=608.16s)]
*  And she's out here trying to be a political clout chaser, basically trying to curry favor with Donald Trump in some weird, sadistic way, because he's a horrible, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=609.6s)]
*  indecent person. So she's bragging about a heart being a horrible, indecent person who will do the hard things by shooting her puppy in a gravel pit. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=619.62s)]
*  This is just a perfect example of MAGA. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=628.22s)]
*  And frankly, I hope that MAGA's ilk is thrown into the gravel pit of history after November, November this year, because that's where it belongs. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=630.34s)]
*  It's sickening. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=639.78s)]
*  You mean the ideology? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=640.7s)]
*  That's a metaphor. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=641.94s)]
*  Just want to be clear, because we're shooting a dog here. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=642.7s)]
*  That's a metaphor about the ideology metaphorically. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=644.86s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  Just important. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=647.94s)]
*  You're actually from a family of I learned this today. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=649.4000000000001s)]
*  You're from a family of dog handlers and came up as a young as a girl, like showing dog like your family. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=652.24s)]
*  The family business was showing dogs. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=658.6s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=660.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, my grandmother was a basically like a Hall of Fame dog show handler. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=661.6400000000001s)]
*  She handled Pomeranian. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=666.32s)]
*  She showed at Westminster, the prestigious Westminster dog show many times. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=667.48s)]
*  She trained, field and rescue German Shepherds when she was younger, when my grandfather was on the police force in my hometown in Paramus, New Jersey, and she was in the women's auxiliary. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=671.4599999999999s)]
*  My grandmother was a tough cookie. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=680.06s)]
*  She's only about five foot one. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=681.3399999999999s)]
*  And my aunt is a championship nationally recognized obedience trainer and has dogs that are obedience champions right now. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=683.06s)]
*  And she's competing in Westminster in 10 days from now. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=691.3399999999999s)]
*  And my mom was a vet tech for 12 years and I was a junior handler and also showed at Westminster. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=694.14s)]
*  So yes, we I come from a family of dog lovers, trainers and handlers. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=699.84s)]
*  I wish your aunt and Kristi Newman crossed paths years ago with the little with the puppy that she's in the in the gravel pit. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=704.7600000000001s)]
*  By the way, just her first response was to say like, oh, you city slickers don't understand life on the farm. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=715.1600000000001s)]
*  She said we love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=720.96s)]
*  Sadly, we just had to put down three horses a few weeks ago that have been in our family for 25 years. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=724.32s)]
*  If you want more real, honest and politically incorrect stories that will have the media gasping pre-order, no going back. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=729.18s)]
*  But and this to me is the key. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=736.14s)]
*  The key thing about this and I want I want to play this clip of Bannon and Don Jr. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=737.82s)]
*  Because what's clear again, this is a this is a PR document. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=742.26s)]
*  This is not she's not trying to win the National Book Award for you know, for memoir. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=746.26s)]
*  OK, this is it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=751.26s)]
*  This is a campaign document. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=752.3s)]
*  It's included. Everything that is included to tell a story to curry favor with the kinds of folks. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=753.62s)]
*  The voters that she wants. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think she thought that they would like the puppy killing story. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=760.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think it's so revealing what Bannon and Don Jr. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=764.08s)]
*  Say about it. Take a listen. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=767.48s)]
*  I've always been an advocate of a of a of a of a woman as a VP because I think you have some strong woman. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=769.96s)]
*  Although Kristi Noem I think is maybe a little too based shooting them shooting the puppy in the in the gravel. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=776.5200000000001s)]
*  I was not ideal. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=782.72s)]
*  Not ideal. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=784.48s)]
*  I got to ask you that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=785.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=785.96s)]
*  Who put that in the book? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=786.42s)]
*  Like I think I was like your your ghostwriter must really not like you if they get to include that one. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=787.26s)]
*  Tara, I just think him saying it's a little too based is so perfect because based is a term of like, you know, a good thing in their world. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=792.5s)]
*  It's the opposite of woke like based bases like hardcore and like him saying it's too base is him admitting that he thought that she thought it would look based to kill your puppy and then surprise it backfired. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=800.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I say that there the cruelty is the point has gone too far here. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=812.24s)]
*  Right. Like these people, the bloodlust is sadistic that they would actually like this, that she made the political calculation to put in being a puppy executioner as a positive. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  I guess there's it's not when you've lost when you've lost Steve Bannon, Don Jr. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=828.12s)]
*  And Judge Jeanine and, you know, Kimberly Guilfoyle and like the MAGA of the MAGA. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=832.96s)]
*  Like you've lost. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=837.8s)]
*  You've lost it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=839.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=840.08s)]
*  So she's just when you thought it couldn't go too far. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=840.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, the American people, they don't come together on many things. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=843.02s)]
*  But being a puppy executioner, I think is something that everyone can agree is disqualifies you from holding any higher office. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=845.98s)]
*  That might be a 90, 90, 10 kind of issue. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=852.74s)]
*  Although we'll say for I always talk to writers, young writers, particularly about good writing details or what make good writing. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=854.42s)]
*  And I will say gravel pit is really what that's going to stick in your head. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=860.22s)]
*  Greta gravel pit. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=864.3s)]
*  Tara Setmire. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=865.14s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LXoGHXMlM&t=865.78s)]
