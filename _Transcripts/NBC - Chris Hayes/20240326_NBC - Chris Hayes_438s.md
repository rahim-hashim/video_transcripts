# 'Trump Bibles': Former president is selling 'God Bless the USA' Bibles in latest cash grab
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump is desperate for cash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=0.0s)]
*  And while it might look like he just pulled a rabbit out of a hat with today's debut of his media company on the stock exchange, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=4.0s)]
*  the full story is complicated and way more trouble. We're going to dig into all of that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=10.0s)]
*  But first remember, Trump has been hawking anything with his name on it, of course, for his entire life. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=14.0s)]
*  That's his shtick. Recently, as he's being squeezed by astronomical legal bills, running a campaign, getting outraged by the other side, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=19.0s)]
*  his selling has gone into overdrive. Trump's latest branded merchandise includes the Victory 47 cologne by President Trump, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=26.0s)]
*  described as, quote, the signature scent of strength and success encased in a luxurious gold bottle. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=34.0s)]
*  The gilded bust of Trump serving as the cap. The collector's piece can be yours for just $99. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=39.0s)]
*  Trump's scents are available alongside his new line of sneakers, including the Never Surrender high tops, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=45.0s)]
*  quote, bold, gold and tough, just like President Trump. Limited edition pairs went for $399 before selling out, though I don't think they've shipped in yet. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=50.0s)]
*  So we'll see if that ever happens. And just today, the ex president introduced a new product, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=58.0s)]
*  the God Bless the USA Bible, named for country singer Lee Greenwood's classic tune for just $59.99 plus tax and shipping. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=63.0s)]
*  You can own an easy to reach large print copy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=71.0s)]
*  All Americans need a Bible in their home, and I have many. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=76.0s)]
*  It's my favorite book. It's a lot of people's favorite book. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=81.0s)]
*  This Bible is a reminder that the biggest thing we have to bring back America and to make America great again is our religion. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=84.0s)]
*  Religion is so important. It's so missing, but it's going to come back and it's going to come back strong, just like our country is going to come back strong. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=91.0s)]
*  I'm proud to endorse and encourage you to get this Bible. We must make America pray again. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=99.0s)]
*  OK, really stuck the landing there. Now, you may be wondering what makes this Bible so special. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=107.0s)]
*  Well, as the website makes sure to note in the frequently asked question section, it is the only Bible officially endorsed by President Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=111.0s)]
*  And if you're wondering why a not particularly religious man would endorse a Bible, the New York Times explains, quote, he is getting royalties from purchases. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=118.0s)]
*  So obviously the guy will do anything to make a buck. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=125.0s)]
*  But of course, he is not just any guy. He is the presumptive Republican nominee for president, the person who may be in the Oval Office this time next year. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=127.0s)]
*  And at least until then, he's the leader of his party with enough power and influence to instruct the House Republican caucus to do his bidding. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=135.0s)]
*  I mean, right now he is single handedly blocking funding for Ukraine, right, at his orders. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=142.0s)]
*  Think about that. There are many powerful, wealthy, domestic and foreign interests who have cash and want things that Donald Trump can provide. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=148.0s)]
*  He has basically opened up a stand with a big bribery sign hanging over it, which brings us to the sudden boon of Donald Trump's media company going public and trading on the Nasdaq exchange for the first time today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=159.0s)]
*  Bloomberg notes the shares of Trump Media and Technology Group Corp rose as much as 59 percent before pairing gains, ending the day just up 16 percent. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=171.0s)]
*  That puts the value of the unprofitable company at seven point nine billion dollars, providing a potential windfall for Trump as he faces mounting series of legal and financial woes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=180.0s)]
*  So Trump owns nearly 60 percent of the company, which, quote, may ultimately be worth than six billion dollars. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=190.0s)]
*  Now, it's important to note he can't sell his stake immediately due to a six month lockup agreement hindering his ability to monetize the shares and ease his present cash chrome. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=197.0s)]
*  But to be clear, I just I don't know if people understand this because the headlines are floating around like, oh, it's worth six billion dollars. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=206.0s)]
*  The numbers of the valuation are totally and I mean totally disconnected from the reality of the actual underlying business here, which has been an utter abject and complete failure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=213.0s)]
*  Trump Media, which includes Trump's social media site, True Social, has, and I quote here, so far struggled to generate a profit, losing 49 million dollars in the first three quarters of last year while delivering, wait for it, just just three point four million dollars in revenue. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=226.0s)]
*  OK, now for context, the federal government officially defines a small business as having revenue between one and 40 million dollars. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=243.0s)]
*  Trump Media is a small business. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=253.0s)]
*  It could get preferential contract treatment when it's dealing with the federal government like a local mom and pop chain or an Etsy seller. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=255.0s)]
*  We also just saw one of the most successful media companies in the entire country, Reddit, go public in the last few weeks with a valuation of about six point five billion dollars. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=262.0s)]
*  What was their revenue? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=273.0s)]
*  Well, last year was over eight hundred million dollars. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=275.0s)]
*  It was 160 times more than Trump Media. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=278.0s)]
*  This is obviously ludicrous. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=284.0s)]
*  Some of it today driven by the meme stock phenomenon by people who just love Donald Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=287.0s)]
*  They want to throw their money at them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=292.0s)]
*  They invest in the company in the same way they would give him a smaller dollar donation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=294.0s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=297.0s)]
*  Do what you want. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=298.0s)]
*  There's a bigger problem here, though. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=299.0s)]
*  It's that anyone who wants to bribe Donald Trump can now just buy his stock. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=301.0s)]
*  Talk about open for business. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=306.0s)]
*  We've already seen a version of this play out or at least something that could plausibly look like how the version might work between Trump and billionaire Jeff billionaire Republican donor Jeff Yass, who's a top American shareholder in Tick Tock. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=307.0s)]
*  Remember, early this month, Yass goes to Mar-a-Lago meets with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=320.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=324.0s)]
*  Yass is one of the biggest donors to Republican politics. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=325.0s)]
*  And after that meeting, like the next day, basically a few days later, the ex president promptly reversed 180 his position on banning Tick Tock. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=328.0s)]
*  He wanted to ban it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=336.0s)]
*  Now he doesn't. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=337.0s)]
*  After Jesse has talked to him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=338.0s)]
*  Now, as it turns out, Yass was also the biggest institutional shareholder of the shell company that recently merged with Trump Media. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=339.0s)]
*  The Times explains a December regulatory filing shows that Yass is trading firm Susquehanna International Group owned about 2 percent of that shell company. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=346.0s)]
*  Now, it's unclear if Susquehanna still owns those shares. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=354.0s)]
*  And the company said in a statement that it quote is a market maker and a zero economic interest in Trump Media, which I believe they have plays on both sides. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=356.0s)]
*  They can sell whoever. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=364.0s)]
*  OK, but just take a second and think about the possibilities here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=365.0s)]
*  For someone that has an interest that isn't just playing market maker. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=372.0s)]
*  All the people there who want stuff from Donald Trump, from desperately cast trap Donald Trump, who's got the clock ticking on the lockup agreement on these stocks, people that want tax cuts and government contracts and favorable treatment in foreign relations. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=376.0s)]
*  This was already a nightmare. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=392.0s)]
*  The first time Trump ran for president back in 2016. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=394.0s)]
*  Now he is more desperate with more people of interest before him. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=397.0s)]
*  So right now Donald Trump, the possible next president is up for sale to the highest bidder. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=401.0s)]
*  Or the cloud icon and enjoy it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_k03XOiVk&t=431.0s)]
