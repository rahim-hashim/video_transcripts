Video Description: After the Supreme Court ruled the Alabama congressional maps violated the Voting Rights Act, the Republicans made a subpar attempt at redrawing the maps. Now, a federal appeals court has handed over the responsibility to a special master to ensure the maps will no longer discriminate against Alabama’s Black voters.

# Court decides Alabama Republicans can’t be trusted to draw congressional maps
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI)
*  State of Alabama's population is about a quarter black. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=0.0s)]
*  The state only has one majority black district out of a total of seven. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=3.68s)]
*  You can see it there highlighted in your screen in blue. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=7.44s)]
*  Now that is so egregious that earlier this year the 6-3 Trump Supreme Court ruled the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=10.52s)]
*  map violated the Voting Rights Act and that Alabama needs a second majority black district [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=15.96s)]
*  or something close to it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=20.88s)]
*  But Alabama Republicans faced with that court decision basically thumbed their nose at the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=23.2s)]
*  court. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=26.5s)]
*  They proposed a map which slightly increased the percentage of black voters in one majority [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=27.5s)]
*  white district. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=31.88s)]
*  Well today a federal appeals court said no, called them out on it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=32.88s)]
*  The panel took the new maps out of the hands of the Republican state legislature and handed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=37.26s)]
*  responsibility to what's called a special master, someone appointed to draw new maps. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=41.66s)]
*  Now the not so subtle subtext here is the struggle for national Republicans to hold [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  the House of Representatives. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  They fear a second majority black district in Alabama would cost Republicans a seat in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=51.74s)]
*  Congress next election, eating into their narrow 10 seat majority. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=55.94s)]
*  Democrats only need to win five seats to flip the House. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=60.36s)]
*  Alabama could be one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=63.44s)]
*  Louisiana may have to add a second majority black district as well. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=64.44s)]
*  And there's the question of the indicted New York Republican George Santos running for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=68.36s)]
*  re-election in a district that Joe Biden won fairly handily. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=71.66s)]
*  And a handful of other New York Republicans in precarious positions as well. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=75.68s)]
*  All of which is to say House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's life is likely to get significantly [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=79.4s)]
*  harder. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=84.28s)]
*  Janay Nelson is the president and director of council for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=85.9s)]
*  which represented the plaintiffs in the Alabama case and argued on their behalf before the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=89.58s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=93.8s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=94.8s)]
*  It's great to have you on the Milgan case, which this case was one of the sort of great [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=96.66s)]
*  victories for voting rights in recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, particularly under the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=100.3s)]
*  Voting Rights Act, which the Roberts Court has been very hostile to. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=105.32s)]
*  So they said, look, you got to draw a second black district. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=109.22s)]
*  I mean, not to be overly reductive, but basically that right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=112.58s)]
*  A majority black district where voters have the candidate of their choice is the language. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=115.18s)]
*  The state just didn't do that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=121.62s)]
*  And so now what? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=124.26s)]
*  Listen, the state of Alabama didn't just not do it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=127.5s)]
*  They boldly didn't do it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=130.5s)]
*  And they claimed that they would not do it despite the fact that the Supreme Court ordered [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=132.82s)]
*  them to do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  And frankly, that is, I think, what was the nail in the coffin for the state of Alabama [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=140.32s)]
*  when it came to the three-judge panel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  They said that concession, that Alabama was so flagrantly in violation of the Supreme [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=147.4s)]
*  Court order, basically decided the case. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=153.32s)]
*  And what we have in Alabama is not just a sore loser. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=157.32s)]
*  We have a state that is engaging in subversion of a Supreme Court order. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=161.56s)]
*  That is such dangerous territory. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=167.6s)]
*  And it's easy for us to say it's Alabama. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=170.14s)]
*  This is what Alabama does. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=172.04s)]
*  And it's not surprising. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=173.34s)]
*  And look at the history. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=174.34s)]
*  But we really can't normalize this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=175.78s)]
*  This is rogue conduct. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=177.98s)]
*  Is infecting our entire Congress with the taint of racial discrimination. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=180.5s)]
*  And it's something that everyone should be alarmed about. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, just so that the court says even the Roberts Court of all courts, right, says this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=188.7s)]
*  is this is flagrant violation of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=192.94s)]
*  You need to redraw the map. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=196.26s)]
*  The state legislature tinkered a little bit, basically sent back, you know, it's like when [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=197.6s)]
*  you're if your kid is really sullen and pressing your buttons, right, like they'll like move [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=202.88s)]
*  one P on the plate and then it's like back at you, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  Like that sort of like sort of performative disobedience. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=210.0s)]
*  Now there's a special master who appoints a special master. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=213.56s)]
*  And what is a special master going to do? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=216.64s)]
*  So the court determines who the special master will be. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=219.68s)]
*  This is a neutral and objective party who will look at all of the maps that are presented, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=222.6s)]
*  look at all the evidence that was presented. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=227.5s)]
*  And this person is an expert in the law. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=230.1s)]
*  They understand the parameters within which they must work based on the Voting Rights [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=232.22s)]
*  Act, the Constitution, the history and doctrine from the Supreme Court. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  And they will then draw a map that satisfies all of those constitutional principles, all [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  of the parameters that have been established under the Voting Rights Act. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=247.38s)]
*  And they will present the court with a map that they believe meets the order of the Supreme [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Court and is otherwise lawful and most importantly, does not discriminate against Alabama's 1.5 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=257.34s)]
*  million black voters. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=264.58s)]
*  Yeah, we should note the special masters drawing maps when there's this sort of litigation [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=265.94s)]
*  or legislatures at loggerheads is not a completely new thing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=270.96s)]
*  In fact, there's a special mass of the group, the entire New York drew the entire New York [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=274.2s)]
*  congressional district maps. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=278.2s)]
*  The chagrin of New York Democrats who hated those maps where they got their butt kicked [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=284.16s)]
*  That is the timeline. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=285.16s)]
*  Is there a requirement that they do this? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=286.72s)]
*  Will the Republican legislature or state officials in Alabama try to draw this out so these maps [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=288.24s)]
*  aren't ready for the next mid next election? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure they will try to. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=297.52s)]
*  This is what they did with the 22 elections. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=299.12s)]
*  We filed this lawsuit in 2021. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=301.44s)]
*  As soon as this map was passed by the Alabama legislature, the Legal Defense Fund and our [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=303.48s)]
*  plaintiffs who we've represented from the very beginning went before the court and pointed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=308.92s)]
*  out the racial discrimination. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=313.56s)]
*  And we got an order back then. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=315.76s)]
*  We've wanted every single level of this proceeding saying that this was racial discrimination. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=317.72s)]
*  The Supreme Court, unfortunately, allowed this map to stand during the 2022 midterm [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=322.92s)]
*  elections. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=328.04s)]
*  But this court, this three judge court made it very clear that the special master must [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  move forth with and that lovely arcane terminology means right away. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=335.24s)]
*  It means get this done. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  And the court was very clear that it wanted this map in place before the 2024 elections. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=342.72s)]
*  Otherwise, we would have black voters being disenfranchised and frankly, all of our Alabama [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=347.56s)]
*  voters being disenfranchised based on a discriminatory map in yet another very important [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=352.8s)]
*  congressional election cycle. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=359.04s)]
*  There's been similar concerns expressed and litigation around Louisiana map that the Louisiana [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=361.24s)]
*  map does something similar and the Florida map. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=367.08s)]
*  In fact, the Florida map was a map that was so aggressive that it was more aggressive [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=369.28s)]
*  than what the state Republican Party in the legislature had drawn. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=374.96s)]
*  So do you does this end with Alabama? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=379.08s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=383.44s)]
*  Let me tell you, there's any number of cases that could have gone to the Supreme Court [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=384.84s)]
*  and gotten the same ruling that Milligan did out of Alabama. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=388.8s)]
*  There are egregious racial gerrymanders throughout this country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=391.8s)]
*  We are filing a brief today in the Fifth Circuit in the Louisiana congressional redistricting [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=395.68s)]
*  case. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=401.68s)]
*  We will be arguing before the Supreme Court in October on the South Carolina redistricting [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=402.68s)]
*  case. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=407.2s)]
*  There was just a win last week in Florida because of its congressional redistricting [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=408.2s)]
*  and on and on Georgia. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I could go on about the egregious racial gerrymandering that is infecting our [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=414.32s)]
*  Congress and creating the imbalance that so many people are dismayed about. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  Janay Nelson, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=426.67999999999995s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io_We00wslI&t=428.47999999999996s)]
