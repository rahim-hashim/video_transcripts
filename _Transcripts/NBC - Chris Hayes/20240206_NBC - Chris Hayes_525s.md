# Supreme Court knows Trump immunity case will be ‘horrible, stupid circus,’ says Lawrence
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU)
*  Donald, I want to just read this truth social post. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=0.0s)]
*  Do we have that from the last block? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=5.4s)]
*  Maybe that just got taken away from me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=7.0s)]
*  Basically, Trump has been saying time and time again [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=8.68s)]
*  that if there's no immunity, then every president, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=12.68s)]
*  to Rachel's point in the previous block, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=16.84s)]
*  then every president will face prosecution afterwards. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=18.44s)]
*  And that always reads to me as an obvious threat. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=21.04s)]
*  I mean, it seems to me he's saying not just, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=23.76s)]
*  can we show that truth social post? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=26.32s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, that must have full immunity in order to, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=29.2s)]
*  a president will be afraid to act, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=32.32s)]
*  I know from personal experience. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=33.76s)]
*  Even our elections will be corrupted and under siege. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=35.56s)]
*  So bad, so dangerous for a nation, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=37.48s)]
*  save presidential immunity. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Basically, he's saying, like, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=40.8s)]
*  I'm gonna prosecute Joe Biden if I'm elected. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=42.24s)]
*  That's the way those always read to me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't reading it as that future thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=46.92s)]
*  I was just reading it as the kind of dumb Trump idea [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=49.64s)]
*  about the way the world works. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=52.56s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=53.6s)]
*  He's saying this absolutely allows me to do it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=54.96s)]
*  I'll do it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=57.44s)]
*  What's so striking about it is that, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  as the court points out in the opinion, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=61.6s)]
*  one thing that matters when you say, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=64.6s)]
*  if this happens, then this will happen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=66.64s)]
*  You know, I mean, what meteorology is interested in is, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=68.88s)]
*  hey, if it comes up this way, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=71.6s)]
*  if the track is this way, this will happen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=73.24s)]
*  How do we know that? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=75.32s)]
*  Oh, because we've been studying it for a hundred years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=76.16s)]
*  We have a couple of hundred years of this not happening. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=78.36s)]
*  A couple of hundred years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=81.16s)]
*  And the court was very impressed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=82.88s)]
*  Court says we're really impressed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=84.88s)]
*  with a couple of hundred years of this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=86.88s)]
*  absolutely not happening [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=88.44s)]
*  when the presidents believed that it could. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you can go into these presidencies [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=93.64s)]
*  and discover that, yes, Franklin Roosevelt was worried [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=95.92s)]
*  that this idea might be against the law. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=99.08s)]
*  Therefore, he won't do it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=101.72s)]
*  Harry Truman was worried that seizing the steel mills [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=102.8s)]
*  could be against the law, but he did it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  And he found out it was against the law [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=107.72s)]
*  and couldn't do it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=109.28s)]
*  They've always been worried about, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=110.64s)]
*  is this against the law and can I do it? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=112.08s)]
*  There's also this really interesting section, Rachel, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=114.68s)]
*  where it's not just the history of the presidency, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  but they also do this analogizing to other positions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  And there's a few different examples, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=122.0s)]
*  Juries, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Like jurors, we need them to make tough calls [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=124.72000000000001s)]
*  and use their discretion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=126.84s)]
*  But like, there's stuff that they could do [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=128.08s)]
*  that would be criminal in their official duty. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=130.4s)]
*  Like if someone paid them to vote a certain way, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=132.56s)]
*  that would be criminal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  Judges, judges have to make a ton of tough calls. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=135.46s)]
*  You know that judges, justices were writing for, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=138.24s)]
*  but also judges can be prosecuted [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=140.88s)]
*  and it all seems to work out. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=143.12s)]
*  Members of Congress have to make tough discretionary calls [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=144.68s)]
*  about what's legal, what's not, also can be prosecuted. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=147.76s)]
*  They sort of go through all these other examples, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=150.48s)]
*  like yeah, there's all these people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=152.32s)]
*  that have to do difficult stuff, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=153.4s)]
*  make tough calls about what the law is, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=155.0s)]
*  and none of them are rendered immune. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=157.2s)]
*  Right, and they go back to cases from the 30s, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=161.12s)]
*  they go through all of those different examples, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=165.0s)]
*  they go through all these different presidential examples [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  that we just talked about, including, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=169.2s)]
*  I mean, again, most famously, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=171.92s)]
*  why did Ford need to pardon Nixon? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=173.2s)]
*  I mean, it says in the proclamation, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=177.0s)]
*  as a result of certain acts or omissions [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  occurring before his resignation from the office of president, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=181.44s)]
*  Richard Nixon has become liable [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=184.16s)]
*  to possible indictment and trial [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=186.24s)]
*  for offenses against the United States, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=188.48s)]
*  Like it wasn't something we had to like read [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=190.6s)]
*  into their state of mind. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Like it's explicit in the proclamation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Everybody knows that after a president leaves office, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  he or she can be indicted, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  and that has always been baked in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=201.28s)]
*  to what presidents have done. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  So this idea that it'll be a new thing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=205.0s)]
*  and it will make all presidents afraid and timid, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=207.12s)]
*  they both disprove it in the law [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=210.08s)]
*  and they disprove it historically [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=211.88s)]
*  and they disprove it in a way that just makes sense [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=213.52s)]
*  to the average American who isn't a lawyer, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=216.24s)]
*  who's trying to understand what's happening [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=218.44s)]
*  with this very radical thing going on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=220.28s)]
*  in Republican party politics, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=222.52s)]
*  trying to put this guy on the ballot again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=224.08s)]
*  Yeah, and to that point about public audience, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  judicial audience, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=228.24s)]
*  Because there are two throughout all of this, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  you know, they're very frank about sort of different [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=231.88s)]
*  sort of interests at play, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=233.88s)]
*  Presidential interest to act with some latitude [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=236.0s)]
*  in a difficult job, the public interest [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=238.48s)]
*  in making sure that people don't try to like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=240.56s)]
*  overturn elections and foment violent coups [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=242.0s)]
*  on the Capitol, which they talk about. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=244.48s)]
*  Now we've got this question about the public interest [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=246.56s)]
*  of this thing getting to trial. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=249.32s)]
*  So here's the timing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=251.2s)]
*  They say the clerk, meaning the court clerk, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=252.04s)]
*  is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=254.0s)]
*  That's basically the sort of possession of the case [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=256.32s)]
*  back to Judge Tonya Chetkin through February 12th, 2024. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  And then within that period, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=263.32s)]
*  the appellant notifies the clerk in writing, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  he's filed an application to the Supreme Court. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=265.72s)]
*  The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=267.6s)]
*  pending the Supreme Court's final disposition [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=269.76s)]
*  of the application, which means it now goes to the court, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=271.68s)]
*  which has a monumental decision, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=274.36s)]
*  both on the merits, but also on the timing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the Supreme Court is faced with a strange one here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=278.48s)]
*  If this was any other litigant, they wouldn't take it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=282.88s)]
*  It's a preposterous claim, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=285.72s)]
*  an appeals court is dealing effectively [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  with a completely preposterous claim. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=290.32s)]
*  And so the only reason to take it is, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=292.08s)]
*  well, it's presidential, so maybe we should weigh in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=293.4s)]
*  But they have to know that they're gonna have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=296.32s)]
*  Seel Team Six in the hearing, in the Supreme Court. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not gonna be one question about Seel Team Six. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=303.44s)]
*  There are gonna be several judges who have an opportunity [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=306.64s)]
*  to question about Donald Trump's ability [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=309.4s)]
*  to have as many Supreme Court justices as he wants executed, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=312.84s)]
*  so that he can get the opinions he wants [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  out of the Supreme Court, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  and he cannot be prosecuted for that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=321.88s)]
*  if he also executes enough United States senators [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=324.08s)]
*  so that he cannot be found guilty in an impeachment trial. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=328.2s)]
*  Yeah, and I think- [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  And so there's a circus. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=332.44s)]
*  The Supreme Court knows, oh my God, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=333.84s)]
*  there's a horrible, stupid circus coming our way. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=335.79999999999995s)]
*  All we have to do is deny cert. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, and it contrasts a little bit with the position [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=342.55999999999995s)]
*  of the case, its posture, Rachel, going forward, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=346.6s)]
*  Because the case they're gonna hear here on Thursday, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=349.16s)]
*  they had to take, basically. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  I think we would all sort of all agree, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  Like, Colorado kicked the guy off the ballot, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  so did Maine, other states aren't. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  There's gotta be some of the highest court in the land [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=362.04s)]
*  is gonna be the one that's ultimately gonna give us [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=363.72s)]
*  a constitutional ruling on this. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  They had to get involved in this one, to Lawrence's point. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=366.88s)]
*  They simply don't. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  Right, and the mechanics of how that happens, though, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=372.72s)]
*  end up being important. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=375.96s)]
*  I mean, you only need four Supreme Court justices [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  to say yes, we wanna hear it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=380.08s)]
*  Which means you need, I mean, you don't need a majority. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=381.88s)]
*  You only need four. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  It's easy to imagine, then, them coming up with the four, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=386.56s)]
*  even if it is impossible to imagine them deciding [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=390.08s)]
*  on the merits in Trump's favor. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=392.76s)]
*  And so do they want to take the case? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=394.84s)]
*  They don't have to agree to have a incredibly radical, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=398.26s)]
*  stupid ruling in order to do Donald Trump a big favor here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=401.64s)]
*  They just have to agree to hear it and then go slow [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=405.06s)]
*  and hope that Trump gets elected, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=408.7s)]
*  in which case all these cases go away. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=411.1s)]
*  And that seems to me, I mean, that's, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=412.9s)]
*  I don't know what we should expect from this Supreme Court. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=416.66s)]
*  It's amazing they're gonna get the disqualification issue [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=418.72s)]
*  on Thursday and the immunity issue on Monday. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=422.58s)]
*  I don't know what to expect for them, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=425.38s)]
*  but certainly if they want to help Trump here, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=426.62s)]
*  they have lots of ways to do it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=429.42s)]
*  Yeah, and we should also say that this court's posture [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=430.62s)]
*  has been an incredibly imperious and greedy one [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=436.02s)]
*  about what they get to say [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  on what issues of public life they get to say. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=442.18s)]
*  They have been sort of sticking their noses [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=445.82s)]
*  in all kinds of places. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=448.29999999999995s)]
*  They've been telling executive agencies [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=449.34s)]
*  that they get to say. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=452.06s)]
*  They've been telling Congress [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  that it delegated things called major questions, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=455.94s)]
*  even though there's no sort of constitutional doctrine. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  They've invented it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=461.02s)]
*  So they seem to be a court, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=462.2s)]
*  at least the sort of conservative majority, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=464.0s)]
*  that is very much a court that's like, we're gonna say. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=466.24s)]
*  And I think that kind of sense of sort of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=468.88s)]
*  their own kind of grandeur and importance, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=472.92s)]
*  it's very hard for me to see them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=474.88s)]
*  To your point, Lawrence, I think they don't want the mess, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=477.64s)]
*  but they also wanna be the like, we're the ones who say. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=479.64s)]
*  And they're the most unpredictable [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=482.6s)]
*  Supreme Court of our lifetimes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=484.8s)]
*  Yes, I mean, particularly on the question of precedent, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=487.52s)]
*  which is what this entire opinion rests solely on, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=493.0s)]
*  which is also sort of somewhat worrying. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=496.0s)]
*  Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O'Donnell, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  what a pleasure to have you both off the top here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=499.0s)]
*  We really appreciate it. Let's do this all the time. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=500.68s)]
*  You bet, thank you very much. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=501.68s)]
*  Really appreciate it. Yeah, this is awesome. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=502.84s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. Great. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=504.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=504.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dc1ogCerLU&t=522.52s)]
