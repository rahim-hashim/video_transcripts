# Ex-Trump voters reveal why they’ve dumped Trump ‘Like a mattress with bed bugs’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k)
*  The election is going to come down to a small group of undecided voters in only about seven [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=0.0s)]
*  states, basically. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=5.08s)]
*  People who tend not to be diehard partisans, because if they were, they'd already know [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=6.32s)]
*  who they're voting for. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And a key part of President Joe Biden's 2020 victory was convincing enough conservative [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  or Republican voters to cross party lines and support him in states like Georgia and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=15.76s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=19.48s)]
*  It's a strategy that Harris-Walls' campaign is, of course, trying to emulate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=20.48s)]
*  The Democratic convention featured many Republicans backing Harris and trying to create a kind [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=24.04s)]
*  of permission structure for their fellow party members to do the same. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  Now I'm not left-wing, period. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=33.46s)]
*  But I believe our leaders should bring out the best in us, not the worst. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=36.66s)]
*  That's why I'm voting for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=43.86s)]
*  She's tough. She's going to tackle inflation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=49.06s)]
*  Trump will make it worse. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=53.3s)]
*  I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she'll make us proud to be American again. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=55.54s)]
*  Kyle Sweetser is a two-time Trump voter from Alabama, publicly backed Harris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=62.9s)]
*  The DNC has just heard. Robert Nix is a former Trump voter from Pennsylvania, and they both [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=67.14s)]
*  are now involved with the group Republican Voters Against Trump. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=71.62s)]
*  We put them on billboards urging their fellow Republicans not to back the former president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=74.69999999999999s)]
*  And they joined me now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=79.62s)]
*  It's good to have you, gentlemen, both. Welcome to the program. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=80.94s)]
*  Thanks for having us, Chris. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=82.66s)]
*  Kyle, let me start with you, because if I'm not mistaken, you live in Alabama, which is a pretty [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=83.94s)]
*  conservative place. Trump's going to win there by 20 points or something like that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  And you are a two-time Trump voter. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  And I guess I tend to think people that went back the second time, 16, 20, pretty locked in, but not you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=96.42s)]
*  What changed your mind? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=103.3s)]
*  Yeah, so I voted for Trump in 2016. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  I thought he was a good change of pace. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=108.58s)]
*  I thought he was a good change of pace. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=111.06s)]
*  I thought the people, especially down here, were not well represented. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=112.58s)]
*  In 2018, we had those steel tariffs, and those started to affect some products. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  So I got to see the firsthand effects of those probably before anyone else. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=123.62s)]
*  The inflation started then. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=128.98s)]
*  And in 2020, after all the things that Trump said, I was actually kind of holding my nose to vote for him, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=131.38s)]
*  kind of beat the Democrats, that kind of thing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  And so I just assumed he was going to go away. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=143.06s)]
*  I assumed it was over with, especially after January 6. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=145.86s)]
*  And in 2022, when I started paying close for attention to geopolitics and what was going on in the world, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=149.94s)]
*  I started to really look at Trump's record, especially on foreign policy and the things that he said. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=158.82s)]
*  I'm just a coddling of dictators and enemies, essentially the United States. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=164.34s)]
*  And I started to look really close at his record. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=168.82000000000002s)]
*  And he's a disaster. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=171.46s)]
*  Robert, you were a Trump voter, I think, in Pennsylvania in 2016, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  and then did vote for President Joe Biden in 2020. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=182.18s)]
*  I did. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  I voted for Biden. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=184.18s)]
*  I did, in fact, like Kyle said, I held my nose and I voted for Biden, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=185.06s)]
*  but because I simply couldn't bring myself to vote for Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=189.86s)]
*  In fact, the reason I'm involved with Republican voters against Trump and on billboards and writing op-eds [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  is because I think I'm trying to atone for even voting for Trump in 2016 and make up for my mistake. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=198.74s)]
*  And there's some people, I think, who would maybe sort of go from Trump and then vote for Biden. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=207.94s)]
*  Maybe they come back in the folder or not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  But you are now devoted. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=215.38s)]
*  What was it for you that pried you away from Trump? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=218.02s)]
*  Well, initially, I mean, from his very first term, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=224.02s)]
*  I began to see the problems right away with the undermining of the press, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=226.58s)]
*  undermining the Constitution, in particular the rule of law, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=230.74s)]
*  and in particular the checks and balances that hold our government together. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=234.02s)]
*  He's flaunted all of that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=239.62s)]
*  And it looked like we were headed towards disaster, you know, just in his first term. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=241.3s)]
*  And then came—and then I couldn't vote for him after that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=246.5s)]
*  But then came the loss of 2020, where he began to—he created the big lie. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=250.82s)]
*  He instigated an insurrection. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  I thought, how can he possibly even run in 2024, much less how people could support him? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=258.5s)]
*  So, yeah, I am appalled as I watched the Republican Party that I've been involved with for 44 years, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=264.18s)]
*  and not just as a voter, but I've run it for office as a Republican. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=269.78s)]
*  I've helped Hispanic outreach all over the state of Pennsylvania, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  with Bush going back to Bush Cheney in 2004, helping Senators Santorum and Specter with [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=277.78s)]
*  Hispanic outreach, the Republican State Committee working for them doing Hispanic outreach. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  And now to see what the Republican Party has been reduced to by Trump is just—it turns my stomach, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=289.38s)]
*  and it appalls me. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=295.05999999999995s)]
*  And so, yes, I could never vote for him again, and I work very hard to try to make as many people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=296.58s)]
*  as I can aware of the problems that we're facing here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=302.5s)]
*  It's not the issues. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=304.9s)]
*  It's the over-over problem of the destruction of our form of government, is what I fear. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=305.86s)]
*  And then I think too many people are thinking, oh, it's just a normal race about—between [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=310.66s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans, and I've got to go with issues like immigration, inflation, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=315.86s)]
*  or Israel, or abortion. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=321.06s)]
*  But those are—we can fix—we can get by with bad policy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=323.54s)]
*  We can survive it, as Liz Cheney said. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  And what we can't survive, the undermining and trampling of our Constitution. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=330.26s)]
*  That's the basis for what I believe in now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=334.26s)]
*  It's so interesting to listen to you two gentlemen, because there's this kind of, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=337.14s)]
*  I think, a little tired and trite, you know, pundit conventional wisdom that, like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=341.7s)]
*  you know, voters, the real voters don't care about things like foreign policy or democracy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  They care about kitchen table issues. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=349.94s)]
*  And yet here you are both talking about how your trajectory is, one talking about foreign policy, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=351.3s)]
*  you, Robert, talking about democracy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=355.86s)]
*  Let me come back to you on that, Kyle, on foreign policy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=357.06s)]
*  It's interesting you mention that, because a lot of times, again, the conventional wisdom is like, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=359.46s)]
*  people don't really care that much about it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, what specifically was there like, was it the Ukraine War? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=365.94s)]
*  Was there something where you started to be like, this is not right, that got you? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=368.66s)]
*  Yeah, so I just started to pay attention to Trump and basically his orbit and the things they say. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  And it was startling how they were pretty much pushing the same talking points as Russia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=381.38s)]
*  So, you know, I started to look back at Trump's record on what was it, S230, trying to come after [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=387.62s)]
*  freedom of speech and tie it into funding in 2020. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=395.94s)]
*  You know, just all those things and the tariffs and the trade and all that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=401.78s)]
*  I don't think people really understand that a lot of these things affect the prices that we have now [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=406.18s)]
*  and they cause inflation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=412.9s)]
*  It's just wild that there's not enough effort to educate voters on how important foreign policy is, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=414.82s)]
*  how important trade policy is, and really how that Trump himself has completely thrown out [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=426.26s)]
*  conservative economic and trade policies. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=434.82s)]
*  He's not fiscally responsible. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=439.86s)]
*  If you look at the current rate or the current federal budget, I think that he's proposed five [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=441.53999999999996s)]
*  times what the Democrats have proposed. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=448.18s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=451.3s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=451.94s)]
*  Trump, he had the single highest year rate of murder rate in 2020. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=454.42s)]
*  So he's not a law and order president. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=464.5s)]
*  Yeah, and that point about tariffs, I mean, he's proposing right now, at a minimum, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=466.58s)]
*  a 10% sale tax on every imported good in the country, which I think is underappreciated. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=471.86s)]
*  Robert, let me give the last question to you in the little bit of time we have here. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=475.94s)]
*  I know how you feel about Trump. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=479.3s)]
*  You were a Republican. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=480.58s)]
*  There's a crucial down-ballot race in your state. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=481.7s)]
*  Dan McCormick is running against the incumbent Democratic senator there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=484.02s)]
*  What is your feeling about that race? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=489.38s)]
*  Well, for me, if you have been endorsed by or endorsed Trump, you're tainted with the same [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=491.54s)]
*  problem that has taken over the entire Republican Party. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=498.74s)]
*  There's only a very few Republicans left, in my view, and they include Liz Cheney or Larry Hogan [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=502.02000000000004s)]
*  or Adam Kinzinger and everybody else. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=506.98s)]
*  If you're going to endorse—I mean, just to see even Haley, after she dropped out, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=509.22s)]
*  endorse Trump then made me sick. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=513.94s)]
*  So yes, David McCormick is tainted, in my view, as well. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=516.02s)]
*  The only way to fix the Republican Party is almost like to burn it down to the ground [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=519.22s)]
*  and start over. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=522.82s)]
*  Anybody who's either endorsed or supporting him or in any way affiliated with Trumpism, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=523.86s)]
*  we have to start over. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  It's like a mattress with bedbugs. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=530.1s)]
*  You think you can spray it with insecticide. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=531.62s)]
*  You think maybe you can steam it, but no. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=533.7s)]
*  You've got to burn it and throw it out and start over. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=535.5400000000001s)]
*  So that's how I feel about anybody who's been endorsed by or endorses or supports [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=538.6600000000001s)]
*  or stands on the same stage with Trump. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=542.9s)]
*  Yeah, time for new mattress policy, sir, and Robert next. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=546.4200000000001s)]
*  Yay. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o1T9nygR8k&t=549.22s)]
