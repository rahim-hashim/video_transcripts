# Trump is 'steering the Titanic towards the iceberg,' says CNBC reporter
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump spent the entire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=0.0s)]
*  2024 presidential campaign promising he would enact tariffs across the board attacks on imported goods. It wasn't a secret [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=4.08s)]
*  In fact, we covered it very extensively right here on this program [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  This week Trump made good on that promise unveiling a well even by his standards [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=15.6s)]
*  Ridiculous tariff proposal that has left nearly all serious economists across the political spectrum [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=20.8s)]
*  downright baffled in Nepal [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=26.96s)]
*  It amounts to an enormous multi trillion dollar tax hike on all Americans issued by fiat by the president [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=28.96s)]
*  Especially on working in middle-class families who spend a larger share of their income on the kinds of goods being taxed here [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=36.8s)]
*  Today in a post on social media Trump told Americans to brace for the damage [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  He's done to the economy with a call to quote Hank tough [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=47.82s)]
*  Adding quote only the weak will fail [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=51.3s)]
*  But the markets were not able to Hank tough [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  stocks falling off a cliff for a second straight session and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=58.96s)]
*  Closing right about at the lows all the major averages off five and a half to six percent with the Nasdaq closing in bear market [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=63.64s)]
*  territory S&P 500 wiping out more than four trillion dollars in value in two days this big beautiful economy that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=70.76s)]
*  Actually was rolling pretty good with jobs and inflation coming down feels more like the Game of Thrones red wedding [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=78.48s)]
*  I mean it is not going well. This is not just the market having a panic. This is bad policy having bad effects [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=84.68s)]
*  Though I will say Trump's friends over Fox Business. They did strike something of a different tone [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=92.28s)]
*  The Dow in correction it loses a third most points in history. That's gonna do it for us [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=98.28s)]
*  Now folks welcome to cut low I'm Larry Kudlow [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=108.28s)]
*  All right the stock markets tariff tantrum continues [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=110.8s)]
*  But you know what key countries around the world are lining up to negotiate with President Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=113.92s)]
*  How about that the action right now? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=119.22s)]
*  more and more nations are talking tariff deals with the White House and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=121.16s)]
*  Lowering their trade barriers barriers. We've got the growing list of names. It's beyond Cambodia and Vietnam [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=126.2s)]
*  I just want to say as an aside someone who works in industry whichever Fox Business producer [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=132.28s)]
*  Opted for the money flowing down animation in that clip like you definitely deserve some recognition [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=139.36s)]
*  Today the chair of the Federal Reserve who is elevated to that position by Donald Trump warned Americans [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=145.84s)]
*  That economic shocks of these tariffs will be real and they could last for a very long time [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=151.24s)]
*  Well uncertainty remains elevated [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=156.68s)]
*  it is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  The same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=163.88s)]
*  The size and duration of these effects remains uncertain [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=170.2s)]
*  While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=174.68s)]
*  It's also possible that the effects could be more persistent [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=179.1s)]
*  Trump called on the Fed which is of course an independent entity by statute to try and bail him out by cutting interest rates [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=183.12s)]
*  I'm not sure the pressure campaign is gonna work or make much difference [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=189.52s)]
*  JP Morgan now estimates the odds of a recession this year at 60% and keep in mind [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  Entirely as a result totally ex nihilo right generated by one man Donald Trump's self-inflicted [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=198.88s)]
*  sabotage of the US economy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=206.04s)]
*  As the Wall Street Journal reports analysts said retaliatory tariffs by other countries [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=207.88s)]
*  Weakening business sentiment in the US and the supply chain disruptions will make things worse [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=212.16s)]
*  Those retaliatory tariffs are already on the way [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=216.48s)]
*  Despite the Trump administration practically pleading with foreign nations not to retaliate [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=219.5s)]
*  China's finance ministry announced a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the US today [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=223.73999999999998s)]
*  Of course, that's a lot of stuff that US farmers export to China. We've been through this before [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump inched us one step closer to a potentially [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  catastrophic global trade war of all against all [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  On the Senate floor this afternoon Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut outlined just how bad it could get [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  Well in Trump's first term he imposed a 20% escalating tariff on washing machines [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=246.46s)]
*  And the idea was that you know, we want washing machines to be made in the United States instead of outside of the United States [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=252.22s)]
*  But because he didn't pair that together [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=258.54s)]
*  With any more comprehensive help for the washing machine industry in the United States [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=261.54s)]
*  It was only downside that's what's coming at scale [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=268.22s)]
*  Not just on washing machines, but on virtually every consumer product a big price increase [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=273.82s)]
*  Little to no domestic job creation all the pain on the middle class tariffs can work, but this is not the way [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=281.22s)]
*  That they work Senator Chris Murphy is going to join me in just a few minutes first [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=288.94s)]
*  I want to bring in Steve Leesman. He's a senior economics reporter for CNBC and Steve [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=292.94s)]
*  I've been watching your coverage with with some interest and I just start by saying [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=296.82s)]
*  What what's what's your takeaway from these last two days [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=300.92s)]
*  Well, you know we can go through the tick by tick I came into the studio about 650 this morning when China put those [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=305.64s)]
*  Retaliatory tariffs on it was clear to the market [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=314.0s)]
*  We're in the middle of a trade war and I watched the market go down another 500 points later in the day [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=316.56s)]
*  We learned that Fed chair Jay Powell. He cannot step in to rescue this market because he has to worry about inflation [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=322.32s)]
*  He can't just worry about the downside growth, but if you take a step back [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=328.72s)]
*  What's really happening here Chris is the market is pricing in the high probability of a recession? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=332.2s)]
*  That's really what this is all about right now how much how little we don't know [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=339.0s)]
*  I will say that if there is going to be a recession there could be further for stocks to fall here [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=342.92s)]
*  One way to think about this Chris is the future value of America is now seven to ten trillion dollars less than it was [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=348.64s)]
*  Less than it was before Donald Trump took office and I guess another way to think about it is this that you know [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=356.08s)]
*  The Titanic hit an iceberg by accident [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=363.64s)]
*  This is the equivalent of steering the Titanic towards the iceberg [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=367.08s)]
*  What's not happening here is the market is not pricing in some form of golden age where? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=372.4s)]
*  Manufacturing comes back to America and this country [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  Prosperous as a result of that the market prices in the future values and that's not happening and just one more thing Chris [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=382.64s)]
*  Which is a lot of conversations I've had with [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=388.84s)]
*  you know big investors people who manage a lot of money is this sense that the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=391.84s)]
*  thought that Donald Trump and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  Especially the lieutenants around him the Treasury Secretary who was a hedge fund manager [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=398.76s)]
*  the Commerce Secretary ran an investment bank that they cared about things like the market and the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=402.32s)]
*  Economy and they could keep the worst things of Donald Trump from happening. Well, that's gone [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=407.5s)]
*  There's not a sense that anybody I don't know if it's competent or anybody who can the adults have left the room is maybe [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=413.02s)]
*  One way to put it. Let me ask you one follow-up on that, you know all along right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=420.26s)]
*  He's promised us and I talked to people on Wall Street myself part of my reporting [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=423.94s)]
*  So there's sort of a bold case in a bear case, right and the bold case is this is all big talk to get leverage for [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  Negotiations and the bear case is no he's serious [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=433.18s)]
*  He means it the man truly loves terrorists, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm part of what you've seen in the last few days is the bear case winning out [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=439.02s)]
*  That's it dawned on people that he's serious now Trump just posting this a true social saying [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=442.94s)]
*  Big business is not worried about the terrorists and then he says because they know they are here to stay [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=447.9s)]
*  But they are focused on the big beautiful deal [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=453.46s)]
*  I think that's his tax bill which will supercharge our economy even as of now Steve [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=455.46s)]
*  You've got people who are like this is all leverage for a deal. I [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  Still don't think that's right. Has that truly sunk in on the street? I [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=463.90000000000003s)]
*  Don't think it has I think but let me let me go a step further Chris if I could please which is this I'm not sure [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=470.22s)]
*  How the president would gain the confidence of the market if he were to say I'm taking all the tariffs off [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  This is very significant for a couple reasons [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=486.22s)]
*  First of all, if you imagine the remember remember that to the great financial crisis [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=489.66s)]
*  The Fed chair could step in or the Treasury Secretary and say we are doing something and they could break the back of the panic [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=493.66s)]
*  That's what happened who will step in now and say what to break the back of this because I [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  Talked to a manufacturer who said he benefits from the tariffs [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=508.02000000000004s)]
*  But he said he cannot invest [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=511.74s)]
*  Because he doesn't know if the tariffs that will help him will be around a week from now a month from now or a year [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=514.42s)]
*  From now that would help him. So there is a [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=521.3s)]
*  Huge lack of credibility. We had Peter Navarro on our air on [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  Thursday afternoon [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=529.66s)]
*  He said we're these are not negotiable on Air Force one in the evening. President Trump said I'm waiting for them to make [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=530.7s)]
*  phenomenal deals [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=538.9s)]
*  This morning the president tweeted out my policies are not going to change [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=540.06s)]
*  So nobody knows and the problem with that is if you want to break the back of the panic [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=544.26s)]
*  You've got to be able to step in and say something definitive that the market believes [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=549.66s)]
*  I don't know that he can do that anymore. It's a really good and important point Steve Leesman great pleasure [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=554.8599999999999s)]
*  Have you on come back anytime? There's gonna be a lot more news on this. Appreciate it. Thank you [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=559.18s)]
*  You [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8B1xDmj_KU&t=570.06s)]
