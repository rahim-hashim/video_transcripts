# ‘GOP merry-go-round’ Congress still paralyzed by Republican speaker fight
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U)
*  It is day 16 without a Speaker of the House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=0.0s)]
*  The Republican Conference still cannot agree on a candidate to fill the leadership vacuum. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=3.0s)]
*  Tonight, after yet another day trying to wrangle votes on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=8.0s)]
*  Congressmen Jim Jordan of Ohio is no closer to the 217 votes he needs to win the gavel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=11.0s)]
*  On Tuesday, as you may recall in the first round of voting, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=17.0s)]
*  Jordan received 200 votes, 12 fewer than Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=20.0s)]
*  Yesterday, he tried again and suffered a net loss, winning the support of just 199 Republicans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=26.0s)]
*  Then, for a brief period of time today, it looked like Republicans, including Jordan, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=33.0s)]
*  were ready to move forward with a compromise plan. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=38.0s)]
*  It would temporarily empower that man, that is, Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry of North Carolina. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=41.0s)]
*  That deal, though, apparently fell apart. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=47.0s)]
*  Jordan went right back to work, lobbying support for a third vote. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=50.0s)]
*  We thought there might be a vote. He met with all 22 Republican holdouts. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=53.0s)]
*  And according to Jake Sherman of Punchball News, ready for this? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=57.0s)]
*  Every single one told him they would not back him for Speaker. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=61.0s)]
*  Ali Vitale is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=66.0s)]
*  David Jolly, a former Republican congressman of Florida, and they join me now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=69.0s)]
*  All right, Ali, I just, you were there today and you've been covering this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=73.0s)]
*  Just, I feel like this thing happens where every, it's like a cliffhanger every 24 hours, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=76.0s)]
*  and then a lot happens, but in the end we end up in the same place. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=81.0s)]
*  So, how did today unfold? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=84.0s)]
*  Oh, you feel that too, Chris? I love doing the same live shot for you, but 48 hours later. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=88.0s)]
*  So, that's awesome. I will say, it does feel like we just kind of are on this merry-go-round [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=94.0s)]
*  where Republicans keep thinking that they're going to get close to doing something [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=99.0s)]
*  and that it all seems to fall apart. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=103.0s)]
*  I think the stunning thing about what we saw from Jim Jordan tonight [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=105.0s)]
*  was the fact that initially, you're right, there was a point today where we thought [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=109.0s)]
*  there was going to be something bipartisan done to empower Speaker Pro Tem McHenry. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=113.0s)]
*  That ultimately fell apart, and after that, Jordan went to meet with the 22 people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=117.0s)]
*  who are current holdouts for him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=122.0s)]
*  Now, the explanations of that meeting start to fall apart depending on who you talk to. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=124.0s)]
*  For Jordan, it was a chance to speak to his detractors, see if it was a chance to get them on board. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=128.0s)]
*  For the members leaving that meeting, though, some of them told our team in the hallway [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=133.0s)]
*  that this wasn't a meeting for Jordan to try to change their minds. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=137.0s)]
*  This was a meeting for them to try to change Jordan's mind and get him to drop out. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=141.0s)]
*  Not a good sign if you're trying to get someone on board for your speaker bid, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=146.0s)]
*  and it's why Jordan wanted to buy himself the time by giving McHenry powers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=151.0s)]
*  and letting himself try to still cobble together votes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah, who is whipping who in this meeting, one might ask. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=158.0s)]
*  David, so one thing that's happening here that I think is a really interesting dynamic [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=163.0s)]
*  and worth paying attention to, we've now seen multiple members of the House Republican Conference [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=167.0s)]
*  who have come out against Jordan saying, reporting security concerns and death threats. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=172.0s)]
*  Multiple members, and they're speaking publicly and openly about this, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=177.0s)]
*  Politico saying multiple members are detailing threats and other intimidation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=180.0s)]
*  they face for opposing Jim Jordan's speakership bid. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=183.0s)]
*  Ken Buck, and this is not at all in the same category, I want to be clear about that, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=186.0s)]
*  Ken Buck said his landlord of his district offices in Colorado is booting him out [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=189.0s)]
*  because of this word, which is that, you know, that's fine, that's Democratic politics, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=194.0s)]
*  you can do that if you want, but the death threats, which have been part and parcel [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=197.0s)]
*  of public life, particularly acutely in the Trump era, for them to be speaking openly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=202.0s)]
*  and for them not bowing to it but speaking about it seems to me a little bit of a watershed moment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=208.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, it's very serious. I mean, one Republican member reported that their child [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=215.0s)]
*  in middle school, I believe, had to have a sheriff's escort or a sheriff's deputy assigned [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=220.0s)]
*  at the school. Another spouse said they slept with a loaded gun last night because of some [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=224.0s)]
*  of this intimidation. And so look, some of it's just grassroots lone actor, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=230.0s)]
*  Probably most of it is. But it is also Jim Jordan and his theme unleashing the conservative influencers [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=234.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=241.0s)]
*  in DC and also Fox News and Sean Hannity. Let's just be honest about it. But this is where I think [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=243.0s)]
*  the one tool that Jordan wants is time. Ali knows this very well. He wants time to continue getting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=247.0s)]
*  to 217. I don't think he has it. I think it's getting untenable because if none of those 22 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=254.0s)]
*  are going to move, that's just a vanity project for Jordan. And I think he knows that. I think he [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=259.0s)]
*  asked for the vote tomorrow because he cannot go into the weekend not having moved a single vote [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=264.0s)]
*  because then he's just taking time away from other possible speaker candidates and he's sucking [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=269.0s)]
*  the oxygen out of the conference. I think as much as Jordan is professing confidence, as much as [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=274.0s)]
*  Fox News is going to come down on people tonight, those 22 need to look over their shoulders, I think [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=279.0s)]
*  this is it for Jordan. I think tomorrow's vote should be the last. But this is somebody who acts by [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=284.0s)]
*  intimidation and brinkmanship, Jim Jordan. It just doesn't work. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=289.0s)]
*  These people haven't worked in two weeks. I mean, in all fairness, they take lots of recesses. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=292.0s)]
*  Right, exactly. They took a recess in the week before that. So in all fairness, it's a little like when [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=298.0s)]
*  COVID hit and everyone got taught like you're essential or non-essential. It's like, I guess I'm not [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=303.0s)]
*  essential, actually. Maybe it doesn't really matter. But it does because we are hurling towards a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=307.0s)]
*  shutdown. The president obviously, tonight, addressing these packages. I keep wondering, Ali, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=314.0s)]
*  like, what is the way out? The McHenry thing was floated. And here's my understanding. I want to tell [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=321.0s)]
*  you to tell me if I have this right. It's a little wheezy that Jordan and other pro-Jordan [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=326.0s)]
*  Republicans got onto the McHenry train with the thought being maybe you can do that to buy more [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=332.0s)]
*  time to whip votes. And then it fell apart because he said he was going to stay in the speaker race [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=339.0s)]
*  and everyone in different directions didn't like that arrangement, I think is my understanding. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=346.0s)]
*  What do you think? My understanding was that in this very lengthy, very tense GOP conference huddle [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=352.0s)]
*  behind closed doors, the fact that Jordan was staying in the race was reason enough for a good chunk [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=358.0s)]
*  of Republican members to say that they wouldn't back a pro-Tem McHenry bid because they felt that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=364.0s)]
*  one seemed to undercut the other in some way. And so initially what was meant to be a Jordan time-saving [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=370.0s)]
*  and face-saving mechanism ended up being not that at all. And I think it was really weird to, frankly, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=377.0s)]
*  cover the rise and fall of the resolution empowering McHenry because as we reported in the meeting, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=383.0s)]
*  McHenry sort of said to everyone in there, hey, if you try to get me to shoot first and ask questions [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=389.0s)]
*  later, if you try to make me bring something to the floor and test the limits of my power that I don't [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=395.0s)]
*  believe I have, I'll quit. You'll figure out who the next person on Kevin McCarthy's list was because it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=400.0s)]
*  sure ain't going to be me. That's a threat that you don't necessarily want when you're already looking for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=405.0s)]
*  a permanent speaker and your temporary one is like, I will turn this car around. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=410.0s)]
*  Such an important life lesson that credibly saying I'll quit gives you real leverage. I want to play what [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=415.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy said about the tense. There was a lot of tension in that meeting. David, I'm going to play for you [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=422.0s)]
*  what McCarthy said about an exchange he had with Matt Gaetz. Take a listen. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=428.0s)]
*  I was at the mic. I was speaking and Matt Gaetz tried to interrupt his hands. I told him to sit down. We sat down. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=432.0s)]
*  I think no, I told him to sit down. I think the entire conference screamed. People are. Listen, the whole country, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=437.0s)]
*  I think, would scream at Matt Gaetz right now. And he's right. But I wonder who's the guy who negotiated Matt Gaetz to make [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=445.0s)]
*  the motion to dismiss resolution able to be called up with one vote. Whoever did that? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=452.0s)]
*  That's right. McCarthy begged Gaetz for his vote or at least vote present in January. He gave him the keys to the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=457.0s)]
*  House. But the amount of vitriol and hatred and distrust in the Republican conference is what is driving all of this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=464.0s)]
*  And here's a perfect example why the McHenry temporary solution. We always framed it as something that would need [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=470.0s)]
*  Democrats. It doesn't need Democrats. Republicans could just say we're going to open the floor for two weeks under [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=476.0s)]
*  the McHenry and pass a GOP agenda on the budget in Israel and ignore Ukraine. They could actually do that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=482.0s)]
*  They're not even unified in that. And Chris, I would say tonight coming after the president's speech, there's also a role [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=487.0s)]
*  now, very public role for Senator Schumer and the Senate Democrats. We don't often talk about them as a political powerhouse. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=493.0s)]
*  They have an opportunity now to respond to President Biden's address, move critical forward, draw a contrast with House [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=501.0s)]
*  Republicans and their dysfunction. Yeah, so I've been coming out of the Senate. Yeah, it's interesting. Alivet Halley, David Jolly, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=509.0s)]
*  thank you very much. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKkrtHEl8U&t=514.0s)]
