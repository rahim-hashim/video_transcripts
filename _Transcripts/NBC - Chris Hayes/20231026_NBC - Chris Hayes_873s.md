# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 25
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow)
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=0.0s)]
*  He served on the January 6th committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=2.6s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=3.96s)]
*  Congressman, new speaker Mike Johnson, your thoughts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=8.48s)]
*  Well, you cannot get to the right of Mike Johnson in the mega caucus. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=11.88s)]
*  It's just, it's inconceivable that you could get to the right of him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=20.0s)]
*  I mean, there are people who are definitely more lunatic than he is, and he's got very [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=23.28s)]
*  good manners, and he's an able lawyer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=29.68s)]
*  But when we say he opposed democracy, we know that from his giving a legal gloss and finish [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=33.12s)]
*  to all of Donald Trump's arguments about electoral fraud and making the independent state legislature [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=40.88s)]
*  doctrine argument, which the Supreme Court fortunately did not bite on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=46.92s)]
*  But if he's not for democracy, what's he for? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=53.32s)]
*  He's for theocracy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=55.44s)]
*  He wants a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  He voted against affirming women's right to travel across state lines for the purposes [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=65.08s)]
*  of obtaining healthcare. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=70.64s)]
*  He's also voted against reaffirming women's contraceptive rights. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  He is a real enemy of Social Security. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  From my perspective, he wanted to increase the age of Social Security retirement to 70 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=82.36s)]
*  years old. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=89.36s)]
*  He's very much in the Steve Bannon mode of trying to dismantle the regulatory state, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=90.48s)]
*  by which they mean democracy itself. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=96.32s)]
*  And so he's a decent guy, and he's a nice guy, but nobody should be fooled by it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=99.36s)]
*  Donald Trump cemented his hold over the Republican Party today, and he is in control of that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=106.72s)]
*  He's the House of Representatives right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=112.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  Also, I'm just going to go out and make a prediction. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  I usually don't do this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=116.8s)]
*  Trump's going to be mad at him at some point. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=119.44s)]
*  He's going to turn on him at some point. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=120.44s)]
*  He's going to betray Trump at some point. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Like, we've watched this a million times, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  This is, I mean, Kevin McCarthy, you know, went down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=126.8s)]
*  He took all the wrong-colored starbursts out of his, you know, out of his bowl to present [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=131.56s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  And what good did that do him? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=138.6s)]
*  The guy got cut loose. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=139.72s)]
*  So like, I don't know how long the clock is on Mike Johnson. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=140.8s)]
*  The future's undetermined. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=145.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=146.28s)]
*  And they could end up having a major conflict over abortion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=147.28s)]
*  I mean, for Mike Johnson, he really believes that it should be a crime for someone to have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=151.4s)]
*  abortion. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  For Donald Trump, of course, he's completely flexible on the issue. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  He used it in order to take over the Republican Party, and he appointed radical anti-choice [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  justices. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=166.8s)]
*  But at this point, he'd like to leave it alone because he knows how to read a poll. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=167.92s)]
*  So it'd be interesting to see what happens between the two of them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=171.28s)]
*  Mike Johnson's a true believer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=173.92s)]
*  I was reflecting today as the voting was going on that if he watched the Handmaid's Tale, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=175.16s)]
*  he would not be rooting for June Osborne. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=180.66s)]
*  He'd be rooting for Gilead the entire time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  He comes from the religious right part of the party. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=186.32s)]
*  He worked for ADF, which is a sort of, you know, right-wing legal org that's brought [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=188.16s)]
*  a whole bunch of suits. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=192.32s)]
*  When Louisiana newspaper, he wrote an op-ed in 2003 decrying the Supreme Court striking [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=194.32s)]
*  down sodomy laws, saying that prescriptions against sodomy have deep roots in religion, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=198.92s)]
*  politics, and law. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=202.92s)]
*  When Louisiana instituted its abortion ban in June 2022, breaking late yesterday, the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=204.42s)]
*  Department of Health informed abortion facilities in our state, the right to life has now been [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  restored. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=213.88s)]
*  Perform an abortion, get imprisoned at hard labor for one to 10 years, and fined $10K [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=214.88s)]
*  to $100K. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=219.4s)]
*  What does it portend for democracy? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=220.4s)]
*  The defining feature of what happened to Emmer, like the interaction between Emmer [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=222.68s)]
*  coming, rising to the surface, Trump being like, nope, he's on the wrong side of the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  most important issue, which is that he's not a coup abetter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=231.36s)]
*  Emmer dropping out four hours later, and then Mike Johnson, coup abetter, that's my guy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=234.84s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=239.0s)]
*  What are the implications of that? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=240.0s)]
*  Well, Trump vetoed Emmer. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=241.0s)]
*  He plucked Johnson out of obscurity and propelled him to the speakership. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=242.4s)]
*  You know, if we were to allow these people to take over the House, the Senate, and the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=250.4s)]
*  White House, we would be where Hungary is today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=254.36s)]
*  It's illiberal democracy that they're interested in, tight control over the electoral process [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  to make sure the results always move in an authoritarian direction, and then cracking [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  down on civil rights and civil liberties, the rights of women. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=267.7s)]
*  They're profoundly anti-gay. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=270.88s)]
*  They're against the right of gay people to get married. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=272.92s)]
*  They would try to roll the clock back 50 years in America. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=274.94s)]
*  That's really where they are at this point. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=279.04s)]
*  So the stakes have been drawn real clearly in terms of the 2024 election. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=281.72s)]
*  We've got the Democratic Party, the Party of Democracy and Freedom, against the GOP, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=286.68s)]
*  which has a bag of tricks in voter suppression, gerrymandering of federal and state, legislative [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=292.04s)]
*  districts, right-wing judicial activism, the filibuster, all of those things to try to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=299.04s)]
*  prevent real democratic priorities. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=303.8s)]
*  And that's going to be the struggle against the theocrats and the autocrats and the kleptocrats [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=306.32s)]
*  and Vladimir Putin moving into the 2024 election. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=315.24s)]
*  Speaking of Vladimir Putin, we'll talk about that in a second, and our next guest about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=316.24s)]
*  how that next piece of legislation is going to look. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=318.92s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, thank you very much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=321.24s)]
*  Today, for the first time, Donald Trump took the stand in one of his many trials. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=323.88s)]
*  Not the two federal trials, not the George R. R. Aracatier trial, not the hush money [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=329.32s)]
*  trial, the civil fraud trial underway in Manhattan right now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=332.96s)]
*  Trump's been attending every day, doesn't apparently have anything better to do, and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=336.24s)]
*  he was summoned to the witness stand by the judge himself to answer for a potential violation [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=339.16s)]
*  of a gag order the judge imposed three weeks ago. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=346.12s)]
*  That gag order came after Trump posted a photo to social media of the court's clerk attacking [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=349.64s)]
*  her. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=356.12s)]
*  And the gag order banned Trump from reasonably, I'd say, quote, posting or speaking publicly [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=357.12s)]
*  about the judge's staff. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=362.16s)]
*  Well, this morning, Trump went to the cameras outside the courtroom and he said this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=363.8s)]
*  We had a jury. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  It would have been fair, at least, even if it was a somewhat negative jury, because no [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  negative jury would vote against me. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=374.12s)]
*  But this judge will, because this judge is a very partisan judge, with a person who's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=376.64s)]
*  very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=382.08s)]
*  He said the judge, the judges with a partisan person sitting alongside him. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=388.08s)]
*  The judge took issue with that comment, summoned Trump to the witness stand to answer for it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=393.12s)]
*  He asked him, quote, to whom were you referring when you said the person sitting alongside [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=397.96s)]
*  of him? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=401.96s)]
*  You and Cohn, Trump said. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  The judge asked, are you sure you didn't mean the person on the other side of me, my principal [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=404.68s)]
*  law clerk? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=409.2s)]
*  Yes, I am sure. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=410.2s)]
*  Later, the judge asked Trump, quote, don't you always refer to Michael Cohn as Michael [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=411.2s)]
*  Cohn? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=415.6s)]
*  No, Trump said. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=416.6s)]
*  His attorneys jumped in to help him out, with Chris Kyes insisting, many things even worse [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=418.08s)]
*  than that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=421.92s)]
*  He was seen a haba adding, quote, yes, your honor, I can confirm that much worse. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=422.92s)]
*  The judge then made his decision, and I quote the judge here, as the trier of fact, I find [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=426.76s)]
*  the witness is not credible that he was referring to my law clerk, who is principal law clerk, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=432.8s)]
*  who is sitting much closer to me, who doesn't have a barrier, whom I believe has been accused [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=438.32s)]
*  by the defendant of being partisan or Democrat or partisan Democrat. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=442.88s)]
*  I hereby fine you $10,000, which is on the low side, to be paid within 30 days to the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=446.88s)]
*  lawyer's fund for client protection. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=452.28s)]
*  Now, about 45 minutes after that, the judge denied a motion by Trump's lawyer, and to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=454.32s)]
*  the apparent surprise of his attorneys, Trump stormed out of the courtroom with secret service [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=458.96s)]
*  chasing behind. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=463.41999999999996s)]
*  Irate and red-faced, he stopped, only to talk to the scrambling cameras outside the courtroom. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=464.41999999999996s)]
*  The witness just admitted that we won the trial, and the judge should end this trial [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=469.64s)]
*  immediately. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=478.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=479.23999999999995s)]
*  The witness admitted and knows her thing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=480.24s)]
*  Joining me now are two people who are in the courtroom for that incredible scene in different [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=484.68s)]
*  roles, former federal prosecutor Donnie Perry, who represents Michael Cohn, and MSNBC legal [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=487.52s)]
*  analyst Lisa Rubin. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  I feel like in the times that I've reported from court, I have occasionally witnessed [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  dramatic scenes, but largely it's actually been pretty boring and rotted, not like television. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=501.36s)]
*  Today was wild. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=506.04s)]
*  Today, as Donnie and I were discussing before we came on set with you, it was a little bit [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=509.92s)]
*  like watching Legally Blonde. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=513.2s)]
*  For our viewers who know this movie well, there's a moment at the end of the movie where [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=515.3s)]
*  a witness on the stand breaks down, admits to a crime, and then the judge essentially [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=519.28s)]
*  rules the trial over because Elwood's client is not guilty. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=523.28s)]
*  And that is exactly what Cliff Robert, who represents the Trump sons, expected to happen [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=527.96s)]
*  today. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=533.12s)]
*  He moved for what's called a directed verdict. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=534.12s)]
*  That's asking the judge basically, truncate the trial, end it now, and fine for us. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=535.44s)]
*  And he didn't do that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=539.54s)]
*  But that's what they expected to happen. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=540.54s)]
*  And they honestly seemed surprised, and Trump seemed just downright angry that that's not [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=542.06s)]
*  what happened. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=546.62s)]
*  It was definitely like television or a film. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=547.62s)]
*  So your client, was he in the room today as well? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=550.06s)]
*  He was. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=552.98s)]
*  He started the day on the stand, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=553.98s)]
*  He was on the stand almost the entire day, other than for the portion of the day where [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=554.98s)]
*  the judge found Mr. Trump not credible. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=558.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=561.34s)]
*  So what happens is Trump comes out and says that thing, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=562.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  You guys were in the room and sort of caught the vibe. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=568.3000000000001s)]
*  It seems to me obvious he was talking about the judge's clerk who he has a fixation on, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=570.46s)]
*  who the lawyers apparently have a little bit of fixation on. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=575.1400000000001s)]
*  Is that a fair reading? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=577.46s)]
*  Do you think there's any context clues he was actually talking about your client, Michael Cohen? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=578.5s)]
*  Well, when he wants to talk about Michael Cohen, he says Michael Cohen. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=582.38s)]
*  In fact, he did in a true social post last evening. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=585.98s)]
*  He did in front of the cameras today. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  So he certainly knows how to direct his vitriol in Mr. Cohen's general direction. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=591.94s)]
*  So I certainly think the judge had ample support for his credibility determination. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=597.98s)]
*  You know, without the rest of the quote, it's a little bit arguable. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=604.1400000000001s)]
*  You could even be generous to Trump and say it's ambiguous. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=607.94s)]
*  But there was a portion of that quote that we didn't have an opportunity to play on air [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  where he returns to talking about Michael Cohen. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=614.86s)]
*  And that to me makes it even more clear that at the very beginning, he is indeed talking [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=617.38s)]
*  about the judge's principal law clerk because then he changes subjects to talk about Michael Cohen. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=622.18s)]
*  And just again, to be clear here, like just you guys putting on your like experience in a courtroom. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=626.54s)]
*  I mean, going after a judge's clerk, posting them on social media when you are a person [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=631.1s)]
*  who when you draw attention to people, often they will receive, they will have security concerns. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=637.06s)]
*  Posting a picture, being ordered by the judge to take it down, not taking down one of them, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=642.1s)]
*  getting a fine for that and then coming out and in your veiled and clever way, talking about that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=646.26s)]
*  I mean, that's totally out of bounds, right? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=652.58s)]
*  Totally. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=656.98s)]
*  I'm like, how is this? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=658.98s)]
*  And it just seems like one of these things where from the beginning, this started, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=660.18s)]
*  this is a guy who's got one mode, test, test, test, test. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=664.42s)]
*  And now we're seeing it in every different venue with Judge Shutkin, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=667.86s)]
*  Judge Shutkin gives him a gag order. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=672.4200000000001s)]
*  Then she temporarily lifts the gag order pending an appeal and he goes on to social and violates. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=674.6600000000001s)]
*  He's not violating gag order stayed the failing New York Times story leaked by deranged Jack Smith, blah, blah, blah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=682.26s)]
*  Goes after a guy who might be a witness like exactly go like. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=688.1800000000001s)]
*  Kyle Cheney of Politico said it right this morning. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=692.6600000000001s)]
*  He said it was like a checklist of how to violate the gag order. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=694.5s)]
*  Kirsten, I'd also point out to you, though, that even if the gag order is stayed, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=699.22s)]
*  he still has conditions of release that include not violating any state, federal or local statutes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=702.26s)]
*  There is a witness tempering statute, 18 USC 1512. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=708.34s)]
*  I encourage our viewers to look it up. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=711.94s)]
*  It's arguable that he violated that even if that federal gag order is stayed. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=714.1800000000001s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=717.54s)]
*  He's trying to test at every front. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=718.1s)]
*  And sometimes he might not even be trying. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=720.02s)]
*  I really do think he has a problem with impulse control [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=721.54s)]
*  and certainly has a problem with listening to his lawyers. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=724.02s)]
*  So I should note in the same way that there's like this colorable claim was about Michael Cohen. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=726.1s)]
*  In this case, the Troop Social Post was about the documents case, right, which is not Tonya Shetkin's case. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=730.4200000000001s)]
*  Now, at the same time, all this drama is happening, right? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=735.7s)]
*  Trump gets pulled up onto the witness stand to testify in his own defense by the judge [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=738.34s)]
*  about whether he's going to find him in violation. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=742.26s)]
*  Your client is in the room and he gets a subpoena today. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=744.5s)]
*  Last night, last night about cross examination in the Manhattan District Attorney's criminal case. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=747.78s)]
*  Trump's lawyers in that case, and there's some overlap, and they were in the courtroom today, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=754.74s)]
*  issued a subpoena to him. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=759.5400000000001s)]
*  And I don't want to get into it because I haven't had time yet to formulate my legal strategy. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=761.38s)]
*  But this was a subpoena to testify in that case? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=767.0600000000001s)]
*  For documents. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=769.94s)]
*  For documents. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=770.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=771.0600000000001s)]
*  Documents that, you know, clearly it has the stink of witness intimidation once again, at least to me. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=771.38s)]
*  After all of this, I mean, there's the, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=780.74s)]
*  this judge has tried hard to keep this trial going, right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=783.54s)]
*  And there's been back and forth about the different arguments that are made. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=788.02s)]
*  Where is the trial now in terms of its arc? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=791.7s)]
*  There are about 27 witnesses that the New York Attorney General intends to put on. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=795.78s)]
*  I'd have to go back to the list to see where we are. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=800.66s)]
*  I don't think we're halfway through that yet. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  Tomorrow, we're expecting testimony from Sherry Dillon, who is the Morgan Lewis [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=805.38s)]
*  partner who was principally in charge of Trump's legal tax work. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=809.54s)]
*  She's a person known to us because she was at that infamous press conference with huge stacks of paper. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=813.2199999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=817.78s)]
*  Yeah. See, I say that to someone who's a cable news host. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=818.18s)]
*  And they're, oh, Sherry Dillon, I know her. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=820.3399999999999s)]
*  I know that sound. We play that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=822.02s)]
*  But I think we'll be here for a few more weeks. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=823.14s)]
*  And certainly they are trying to delay install at every turn. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=825.38s)]
*  You saw that yesterday they made a huge issue out of a COVID outbreak on the Attorney General's side, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=828.5799999999999s)]
*  trying to use that to delay trial a day further. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=833.4599999999999s)]
*  And yet nobody on the Trump side of the courtroom was wearing a mask. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=835.9399999999999s)]
*  Which Judge Engoran noted to them were widely available and they were free to wear. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=839.46s)]
*  No one's more, you know, COVID neurotic, Donald, Donald J. Trump. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=843.38s)]
*  Dona Perry, Lisa Rubin. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=849.14s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=850.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=851.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GvJmzm3cow&t=869.46s)]
