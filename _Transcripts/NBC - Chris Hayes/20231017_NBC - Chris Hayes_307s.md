# Raskin floats Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney, Angus King as consensus speaker options
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A)
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=0.0s)]
*  He served on the January 6th committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=2.4s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=4.1s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=6.4s)]
*  How much insight do you and your caucus [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=8.8s)]
*  have into what is happening now? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Because we were having a conversation today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=14.5s)]
*  I mean, we were really out past precedent here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=16.3s)]
*  Hasn't really happened. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  No one really knows what happens next. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  We were having a conversation today [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=21.3s)]
*  about trying to game this out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=22.2s)]
*  It's just kind of hard to say. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  What's your understanding? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=25.2s)]
*  Well, on the House floor on the Democratic side, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=28.099999999999998s)]
*  there were discussions today at the macro level [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=30.7s)]
*  and the micro level. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=33.4s)]
*  And at the macro level, we are seeing this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=34.4s)]
*  in the context of a series of attacks [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=36.8s)]
*  by the mega rule-or-ruin faction [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=40.2s)]
*  on the constitutional order. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=44.2s)]
*  And it began on January 6th with a violent insurrection [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  and an attempted political coup [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=48.9s)]
*  to overthrow President Biden's victory [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=50.9s)]
*  in the Electoral College. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=54.4s)]
*  Then we went to the Republicans [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=56.7s)]
*  trying to sabotage any investigation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=59.2s)]
*  into what happened on January 6th. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  We know that Kevin McCarthy pulled the plug [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=65.0s)]
*  even on their own plan [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=66.8s)]
*  for an outside bipartisan commission. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=68.2s)]
*  Then we went from there to an attempt to default [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=70.9s)]
*  on the debts of the United States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=73.4s)]
*  Then we went from there to an attempt [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=75.4s)]
*  to shut down the government of the United States. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=77.4s)]
*  And now they're trying to install [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=79.10000000000001s)]
*  one of the critical pro-insurrection, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=81.5s)]
*  pro-political coup actors in the House, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=85.0s)]
*  if not the key one, as the Speaker of the House. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=88.1s)]
*  So it's a remarkable moment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=91.3s)]
*  Now, in terms of the daily back and forth [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=92.5s)]
*  and the inside Machiavellian moves, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=96.0s)]
*  we get it secondhand, of course. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=98.1s)]
*  We're not there in the Republican Conference. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=99.6s)]
*  But I will tell you that many of us [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=101.8s)]
*  were told on the way in today [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=104.1s)]
*  that at most the GOP defectors [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=106.3s)]
*  amounted to around 10 or a dozen, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=108.9s)]
*  and they got 20 votes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=111.4s)]
*  And I think that they were planning on going [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=113.1s)]
*  to the second or third ballot today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=115.5s)]
*  And obviously the pro-Jordan forces needed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=117.6s)]
*  at least a day or a night to try and regroup [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=120.8s)]
*  to go after the large numbers [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=123.4s)]
*  of unexpected votes against him. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=126.6s)]
*  Yeah, I should note that the Democratic minority leader, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=130.2s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, got more votes than Jim Jordan did today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=133.4s)]
*  And in fact, were at a first-past-the-post election, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=137.8s)]
*  he would be the Speaker. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=140.8s)]
*  It's not the way it works in the U.S. Constitution. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=141.6s)]
*  You need an outright majority of those seated. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  Here's what Hakeem Jeffries said about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=145.1s)]
*  bipartisan conversations that are happening [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=148.1s)]
*  about resolving this speakership crisis. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=153.0s)]
*  I have no meetings planned with Henry, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=155.1s)]
*  but high-level members on the Democratic side of the aisle [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=157.2s)]
*  are ready, willing, and able to have those conversations. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=161.7s)]
*  There have been ongoing, informal conversations [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=163.9s)]
*  that have been undertaken over the last few days. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  I think there's a possibility those can accelerate [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=171.1s)]
*  now that Jim Jordan clearly does not have the votes to be Speaker. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=174.6s)]
*  Would you be open to some kind of pact, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  some sort of deal struck to elect a Speaker that was a Republican, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=184.4s)]
*  but in exchange for, you know, some sort of demands on rules [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=189.2s)]
*  or a vote on a CR or something like that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=194.9s)]
*  Well, obviously we favor Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=197.7s)]
*  This was the 16th time we've voted unanimously [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=200.1s)]
*  and passionately for Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=203.9s)]
*  He's a super well-organized, efficient, effective leader, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  and you can take him in his word. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=209.5s)]
*  He's totally trustworthy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=211.1s)]
*  But if we can't get six Republicans to come over to our side, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=212.2s)]
*  I've said from the beginning, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=216.6s)]
*  there are a number of Republicans that I could support [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  on a principled power-sharing basis, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  assuming that our caucus were to endorse that, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  and we operate as a caucus. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=226.5s)]
*  We're not out there wheeling and dealing on our own, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=227.8s)]
*  but one of the things that I've said from the beginning [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  is Liz Cheney would be a perfect choice herself. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=233.3s)]
*  She was the chair of the Republican Conference. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=235.5s)]
*  She was the number three Republican for several years. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=237.9s)]
*  Well, we're here, a very conservative Republican, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=241.4s)]
*  but she believes in the constitutional order, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=244.4s)]
*  and so we trust her. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Mitt Romney is another name that has been floated [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=248.3s)]
*  as someone who we could trust. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=250.9s)]
*  Angus King, who's the independent from Maine, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=252.9s)]
*  is another person that we could look at. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=255.5s)]
*  And a lot of my colleagues, Chris, come from states [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=257.5s)]
*  where there have been state legislative power-sharing arrangements [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=260.4s)]
*  where gavels are shared, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=264.5s)]
*  half of the committees to one side, half to the other side. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=266.4s)]
*  The parties can take turns holding the gavel during the week. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=269.9s)]
*  It would be a very positive thing for us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=273.1s)]
*  We need to get aid to our Democratic allies in Ukraine and in Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=275.0s)]
*  We need to keep the government going. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=279.8s)]
*  This is a very serious condition [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=281.3s)]
*  that the GOP chaos has plunged us into right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=283.6s)]
*  The GOP is a very important party. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=287.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=289.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=291.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=293.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=295.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=297.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=299.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=301.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=303.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=305.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=307.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=309.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=311.5s)]
*  It's a very important party. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdsSDe95_A&t=313.5s)]
