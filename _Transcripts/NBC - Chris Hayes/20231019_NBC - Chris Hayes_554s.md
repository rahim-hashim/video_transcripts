# Psaki: Biden address reminded America of ‘stakes’ of Israel-Hamas, Ukraine wars
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw)
*  Joining me now to talk about what we just heard are my MSNBC colleagues Joy Reid, host [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=0.0s)]
*  of The Readout, and Jen Psaki, host of Inside with Jen Psaki. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=4.92s)]
*  Jen, as someone who worked in a White House doing communications, that was quite a task [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=8.24s)]
*  that he had in front of him. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=13.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=15.0s)]
*  I mean, first, I think we should take a moment and recognize Vladimir Putin as someone Joe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=16.0s)]
*  Biden met with two years ago, and now he just compared him to Hamas in a speech, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  That is a significant road that Putin has traveled. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=26.16s)]
*  What also stuck out to me, Chris, is that he continued to say, if we walk away, if we [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=30.96s)]
*  walk away, and the consequences. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=36.1s)]
*  And what I heard there is him reminding the public of the importance of this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=38.28s)]
*  He also said, terrorists, if terrorists don't pay a price, if dictators don't pay a price, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=42.3s)]
*  this will continue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  So what I heard from him is just a reminder to the public of why this is so important [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  for the United States to be engaged, why the United States as an indispensable power [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=54.68s)]
*  needs to be engaged in these conflicts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=59.56s)]
*  I think it was very important, and I don't think it's going to satisfy everybody who [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=61.8s)]
*  is hurting right now and feels in pain right now, but that he talked about not just anti-Semitism, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=65.32s)]
*  but also Islamophobia. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And those are two concerns also we've seen kind of grow across the country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=72.76s)]
*  So a very tricky verbal speech there, no question. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=75.76s)]
*  But I do think, hopefully, what he did was remind people of the stakes here and also [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=80.0s)]
*  take it back to the domestic impact. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=84.5s)]
*  Yeah, he talked, Joy, about when he was talking domestically about some of the things that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=86.22s)]
*  we've seen domestically. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=92.34s)]
*  He talked about Jewish families. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=93.58s)]
*  And I know I'm sure everyone has experienced this firsthand, worried about Jewish day schools, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=95.54s)]
*  worried about sending their children, worried about wearing yarmulkes out in the streets [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=101.38s)]
*  in the days after this attack. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=105.44s)]
*  He talked about the murder of Wadia Alfayumi in Illinois, who was murdered by a man who [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=106.7s)]
*  had been wound up and enraged, apparently, according to his wife, in a sheriff's statement, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  listening to conservative radio, urging Americans not to turn on each other. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=116.1s)]
*  What do you think about that section of the speech, Joy? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and this is the thing that Joe Biden does better than most politicians, the sort [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  of empathy and being able to relate to and connect to the pain of very different communities. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=128.62s)]
*  And I think he did that very well, as Biden does, in talking about the pain of the Jewish [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=136.38s)]
*  community, who is terrified. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=142.06s)]
*  The attacks by Hamas raised these fears that are ancient in some ways, that go back decades. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  And then at the same time, there's this little boy, this six-year-old boy, who didn't deserve [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=152.9s)]
*  to pay for that with his life. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=157.22s)]
*  He's just a child. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=158.74s)]
*  And you have Muslim and Arab communities who are not just afraid, but they're also angry. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=160.1s)]
*  And in many instances, they're angry at him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=167.54s)]
*  And to me, this was a difficult tightrope for him to walk, because right now, a lot [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  of Muslim and Arab communities are actually angry not just about what's happening in Gaza [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=174.7s)]
*  and looking at the horrors there and the bomb that exploded near that hospital. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=180.66s)]
*  They're also angry at Joe Biden. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=186.06s)]
*  I'm not sure that his expressions of empathy do that much to degrade that anger, because [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=189.46s)]
*  it was difficult for him to walk this tightrope of describing two unlike conflicts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=198.78s)]
*  I think everyone understands very clearly what Russia is doing to Ukraine, as he said, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=202.98s)]
*  describing Ukraine as being a gift that was given by Russia and that they can take it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=208.94s)]
*  back at any time and say, but these are not unlike. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=213.18s)]
*  These are unlike conflicts. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  In the case of Russia and Ukraine, it is a country trying to annihilate a neighboring [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  democracy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=223.66s)]
*  In the case of Israel and the Palestinians, this is a conflict taking place within one [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=224.66s)]
*  country and the territories it occupies. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  And so these are not neighboring countries in the Middle East. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=235.66s)]
*  It is Israel and its occupied territories. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=239.18s)]
*  It is an internal fight inside that country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=242.78s)]
*  And the issue of occupation was not brought up by President Biden. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  And it's difficult. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=253.5s)]
*  They're not the same conflict. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=254.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=257.02s)]
*  I think he did mention, we should say that he mentioned talking to Mahmoud Abbas, who [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=258.02s)]
*  of course is the president of the Palestinian Authority, which has no real role in Gaza, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=262.1s)]
*  the West Bank, and saying that he told Mahmoud Abbas that he supports essentially dignity [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=267.22s)]
*  and the right to self-determination, I believe, was the phrase he used for Palestinians at [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  Hamas's evil attack, do nothing to diminish belief in that rights. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=278.66s)]
*  But to your point, Joy, and Jen, this is, I think, where the sort of rubber hits the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=282.86s)]
*  road on both these conflicts is, if you're the best speechmaker in the world, you're [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=287.06s)]
*  taking sides in both of them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=293.26000000000005s)]
*  There are American allies, and there's going to be money and weaponry flowing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=295.94s)]
*  And it's going to be a fair amount of money, not in the context of the American government's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=299.54s)]
*  budget. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  In fact, it's basically a rounding error in the American budget and even in the defense [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  budget, but in sort of sheer dollar terms. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=308.82s)]
*  And so, Jen, on both the geopolitics of this, where there's an international audience, and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=311.18s)]
*  the domestic politics, there's a certain amount of straddling that's just not really possible. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  That is true. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=320.3s)]
*  I also think a certain amount of things you can't accomplish in a 15-minute speech. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=321.3s)]
*  And when I worked for President Biden, what I know of how he kind of uses these moments [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  and speeches and words is he recognizes that he is going to have to play a role and likely [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=331.7s)]
*  is behind the scenes right now in encouraging Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israelis, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=337.98s)]
*  who he has stood behind publicly very, very strongly, to exercise some caution, to exercise [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=343.46s)]
*  some consideration of civilians and civilian casualties. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=351.94s)]
*  He is going to need to use that leverage. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  That also may mean, and I think likely means, he could not get into details here about occupation [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=358.74s)]
*  or about the history of this conflict, because he is still in a role of playing chief diplomat [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=364.78s)]
*  and the president of the United States. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=370.7s)]
*  And so as much as people want to hear those words and hear that recognition, I mean, some [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=372.6s)]
*  of these people who are leaving Gaza have been refugees multiple times over, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=377.12s)]
*  Their grandparents have been refugees. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the pain and suffering, the fact that these people haven't had a home is so visceral. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=384.0s)]
*  But this wasn't the moment in the speech, because he has to think about the role he [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  has to play as president. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=393.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=394.04s)]
*  And there's been reporting on this, about the sort of hug Netanyahu strategy, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=395.04s)]
*  full and 100% public support. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=399.52s)]
*  So as a means of whatever private conversations, back channels and leverage, there can be leverage [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=402.64s)]
*  there because nothing public is going to work. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  Although he did reiterate, I think, the thing that you said, Jen and I agreed with, what [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  I thought was the sort of most significant thing he said about that 9-11 comparison. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=414.44s)]
*  And he made two points about it that I thought were interesting and I think echoed things [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=419.24s)]
*  that I've been thinking. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=422.28s)]
*  sort of the rage and the anguish and the grief leading to mistakes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=424.28s)]
*  That's the term he used. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  And also the fear of a kind of hysteria, a kind of self-censorship, a kind of heavy weight [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  that hangs over discourse. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  That means that people either, you know, don't worry about what they say or they worry about [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  their neighbors. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=444.78s)]
*  Joy, I thought that was an interesting thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=445.78s)]
*  He himself used that touchstone in the speech was striking to me. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=447.55999999999995s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=451.28s)]
*  And again, this is probably the most difficult tightrope in the world that a president would [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=452.28s)]
*  have to walk and, you know, and trying to weave these two conflicts together. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=462.0s)]
*  And he talked about people, you know, needing to be able to be America, right? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  And you know, there is a sense in which Biden is a nostalgia candidate and, you know, and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  that Trump is as well, right? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=474.28s)]
*  Trump is a nostalgia for something dark in our past. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=475.28s)]
*  But Biden is a nostalgia politician, too. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=477.9s)]
*  He still refers to America as the essential nation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=481.68s)]
*  He still views America as the greatest peacemaker. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=485.36s)]
*  And he still seems to believe that he can rhetorically call on Americans to also be [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=488.8s)]
*  at peace rhetorically with each other, to be able to talk about this conflict in a way [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVOxdDZFqBw&t=495.04s)]
