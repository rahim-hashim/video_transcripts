# 'Epic downfall': Giuliani bankruptcy reveals depths of financial ruin
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng)
*  Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy filing includes lists of creditors. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=0.0s)]
*  He owes over $150 million. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=4.1s)]
*  And as Daily Beast reporter Roger Sollenberger points out, these lists are like a roadmap [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=6.3s)]
*  to the downfall of the man once known as America's mayor. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=10.3s)]
*  One of the people on the list, for instance, is attorney Robert Costello's firm. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=13.18s)]
*  Now, Costello represented Giuliani in a whole bunch of things, from the federal investigation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=17.22s)]
*  into his business dealings in Ukraine, to the FBI raid on his home and office, to the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=21.6s)]
*  January 6 committee's investigation into the insurrection, to disciplinary proceedings [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=25.64s)]
*  that could lead to his disbarment for helping Trump try to steal the election. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=30.3s)]
*  And the criminal case against Giuliani in Georgia, where he is now indicted on 13 felony [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=34.14s)]
*  charges. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=38.54s)]
*  Now, according to the filing, Costello's firm, Davidoff, Hutcher, and Citron, is claiming [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=39.54s)]
*  they are owed over $1.3 million, an amount that Giuliani disputes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  But that amount pales in comparison to the $146 million a judge ordered Giuliani to pay [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=49.86s)]
*  former Georgia election workers Rumi Freeman and Shea Moss for defamation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=55.72s)]
*  Roger Sollenberger is a senior political reporter for Daily Beast. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=60.0s)]
*  He's been reporting on Giuliani for years, and he's been poring through this filing all [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=63.44s)]
*  day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=66.76s)]
*  Roger, I've been following your reporting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=67.76s)]
*  So just first sort of take a throw through what you gleaned from this bankruptcy filing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=69.08s)]
*  of federal court today. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=73.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the most fascinating thing to me, like you're saying, is this roadmap. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=74.36s)]
*  Very rarely do you get to see a look at someone's personal downfall laid out so neatly before [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=81.94000000000001s)]
*  you, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=89.26s)]
*  The list of creditors is really the roadmap or just the story, a path through the last [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=90.26s)]
*  four years or so of Rudy Giuliani's precipitous public decline, which we have seen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  And because he's been such a character and has been through so many events in that time, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=101.26s)]
*  you tend to forget just how many things have happened. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=107.78s)]
*  And yeah, this filing really takes you through that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=113.04s)]
*  There's an accounting firm from his 2019 divorce proceedings that is suing him, just sued him [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=116.88s)]
*  in November, I think, for $10,000. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=124.12s)]
*  They just seen the writing on the wall. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=127.16s)]
*  There's a lawsuit from a former assistant that is suing him for pretty revolting claims [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=129.72s)]
*  of sexual harassment. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=136.12s)]
*  I don't know if we remember those. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=137.12s)]
*  There are two law firms that are suing him for fees that are owed him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=140.54s)]
*  One of them is or at least was representing him in Georgia for free, but they are also [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=143.8s)]
*  claiming back fees. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=149.36s)]
*  There's Costello's firm claiming back fees. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  There's the IRS. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=152.12s)]
*  There's the New York State Department of Taxation that is claiming from him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=153.12s)]
*  It's really a, you know, looking at it as a portrait of a man. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=157.58s)]
*  It's not so flattering. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=161.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that the Times noted, of course, too, just in terms of this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  sort of epic downfall, just this almost Greek mythic sort of trajectory of this individual [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=168.96s)]
*  who, to my mind, has for much of his career displayed precisely the same attributes consistently. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=173.96s)]
*  But I should note that he really lived a lavish life. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=180.44s)]
*  He made millions of dollars a year in his private law practice after he left public [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=184.68s)]
*  office. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  He had this consulting firm that was enormously lucrative after 9-11. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=189.12s)]
*  His divorce from his third wife exposed the couple's once lavish lifestyle, a $230,000 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=193.68s)]
*  a month spending habit, six houses, 11 country club memberships. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=198.44s)]
*  Now, he says he's broke. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  He's filed for bankruptcy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=204.52s)]
*  He owes all these people money. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=205.68s)]
*  I guess the question is, given the judge saying she doesn't trust he's not hiding assets, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=208.4s)]
*  like what do we know about how much this is an actual full display of his actual finances [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=212.28s)]
*  if there's some secret money squirreled away somewhere or there isn't? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we don't really quite know. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=222.76s)]
*  We can take him at his word. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=226.6s)]
*  Some assets that I don't think have been listed are four World Series rings that he got when [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  he was mayor that are diamond encrusted and valued. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=234.72s)]
*  I think about $200,000 back in 2007. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  They've got his name on them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if those lawyers are aware that they've existed or if those things might be [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  hawks somewhere, but those are assets. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=246.4s)]
*  He does have money. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=250.56s)]
*  And his wife, his ex-wife, when she was suing him in this divorce proceeding, was alleging [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  that he was concealing his money and that he was doing so, by the way, through his relationship [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=257.44s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=263.68s)]
*  It was through that 2018-2019 mess in Ukraine where Rudy really needed money. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=265.44s)]
*  He was spending a lot of it, allegedly, to keep it from his wife. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=272.64s)]
*  The filing also tells this story of spite of him. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=277.36s)]
*  It reveals sort of his character in that way, too. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=280.88s)]
*  But again, working for Trump for free, by the way, to get him impeached the first time, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=283.6s)]
*  working for him again, 2020, and then trying to charge him not getting paid, getting him [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=290.0s)]
*  impeached the second time, going hat in hand to Donald Trump this past year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=295.92s)]
*  I'm not really sure if he has squirreled away money somewhere to make that speculation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=301.76s)]
*  I think one tell is that he has not been paying his bills. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=311.84s)]
*  His lawyer, like you were pointing out, Robert Costello, a longtime friend of Rudy Giuliani, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=319.84s)]
*  right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=324.0s)]
*  And that law firm is suing him for $1.4 million. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=324.4s)]
*  So is he actually really stiffing his friend on this money to keep something somewhere [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=328.56s)]
*  away from other creditors that he really hates and really doesn't want to have his money? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=334.0s)]
*  Who's to say? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=339.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the Occam's razor here is he's broke. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  We should just note, and you note this in the piece, that the actual damage he did to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=346.88s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and Seamus' lives is remarkable and acute and lasting. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=352.32s)]
*  It's why the jury found in their favor, and one hopes that they do see some actual restitution, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=359.2s)]
*  whatever comes out of this process. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=366.4s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether that will happen, but that remains my hope. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=370.08s)]
*  Roger Sollenberger, who's done great reporting on this throughout, thank you very much. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=373.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W36wF6OcAng&t=382.32s)]
