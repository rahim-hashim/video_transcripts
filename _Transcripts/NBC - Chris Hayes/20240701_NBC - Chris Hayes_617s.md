Video Description: Rachel Maddow on the Supreme Court's immunity decision: "This is a death squad ruling. This is a ruling that says that as long as you can construe it as an official or quasi-official act, you can do absolutely anything.

# ‘Death squad ruling’: Maddow reacts to Supreme Court Trump immunity decision
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4)
*  I'm joined now by Rachel Maddow, host of the Rachel Maddow Show, whose award-winning podcast [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=0.0s)]
*  Ultra is now in its second season, and I've been gobbling up every episode of that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=4.16s)]
*  Rachel, just your thoughts. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=9.76s)]
*  I remember talking to you the day of oral arguments when we did a special, and I think [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=12.32s)]
*  everyone's reaction to that was, whoa, this is, are they going to do this? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=16.8s)]
*  We got our answers today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=23.04s)]
*  I remember talking to you about this, Chris, the day they chose to take it up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=24.76s)]
*  The decision to take it up itself was so gobsmacking. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=28.56s)]
*  And I'm generally a glass half empty kind of person. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  I always see the cloud before I see the silver lining. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=38.96s)]
*  But even when they took it up, I remember you and I talking about the radicalism of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=41.48s)]
*  that decision in itself, because when the district court, the first level federal court, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=45.04s)]
*  ruled on this issue, basically the rule was, you know, duh, of course a president isn't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=50.44s)]
*  when the appeals court then looked at that and reviewed that decision. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=56.76s)]
*  It was a unanimous, absolutely bulletproof decision from that appeals court where the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=61.32s)]
*  bottom line was essentially, duh, of course, no, a president can't be immune. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=66.84s)]
*  So it was gobsmacking when the Supreme Court took it up. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=71.78s)]
*  But I remember talking to you that day and in my glass half empty kind of way, I thought, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  well, the worst, even under the worst case scenario, it's not like they're going to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=80.0s)]
*  decide that he's immune. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=83.6s)]
*  It's just outrageous that they've taken it up because this will allow for months of delay [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=85.48s)]
*  and will effectively give him temporary immunity before the election. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  And once the election happens, if he wins, he makes all the prosecutions go away anyway. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=95.04s)]
*  I really did not expect that they would do this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=99.56s)]
*  And they, you know, Donald Trump and his counsel asked for this 100 percent absolute immunity [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=102.44s)]
*  thing, which was insane. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=110.84s)]
*  I would say they got 105 percent of what they were asking for. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  They got immunity from this court, despite some of the language in Judge Justice Roberts's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=116.04s)]
*  ruling saying that there was some some some measure of humility or some measure of restraint. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  The practical impact of what they have done is to give Trump immunity that even he and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=128.88s)]
*  his counsel did not ask for. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=133.76s)]
*  And given that the hypotheticals over the course of these arguments, as you rightly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=135.88s)]
*  pointed out, included things like can the president assassinate a rival? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=140.2s)]
*  I think we have to look at the Supreme Court's affirmative answer to that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=144.28s)]
*  Yes, you can. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  With as much seriousness as it deserves. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=151.16s)]
*  I mean, this is a death squad ruling. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  This is a ruling that says that as long as you can construe it as an official or quasi [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  official act, you can do absolutely anything, absolutely anything and never be held [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=161.16s)]
*  accountable, not only while you are president, but forever. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=169.76s)]
*  And this is a president who has activated pro-Trump paramilitary groups that wear insignia [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  and t-shirts and hold placards celebrating literally right wing death squads. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. This is a president who has talked about absolutely using the Justice Department [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=184.88s)]
*  to go after his to go after his rivals. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=189.68s)]
*  This explicitly immunizes anything the president wants to do through the Justice Department, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=194.68s)]
*  but all but explicitly justifies anything the president wants to do full stop to anyone. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=200.08s)]
*  And that is as serious as it gets. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm 100 percent with you on that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to I want to stay on the Department of Justice thing, because obviously, and there's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  reason why in those in the hypothetical offered by a federal judge in the Appeals Court arguments [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=212.56s)]
*  about SEAL Team 6 and then we talked about it in SCOTUS and then in the decision why [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  that has had such significance. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=224.28s)]
*  Right. But that is a hypothetical. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  It hasn't happened in American history. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  What has happened in American history is a president, Richard Nixon, using the Justice [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  Department, the IRS, all kinds of faculty. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he had the IRS audit his political enemies. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=240.12s)]
*  He attempted to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=243.56s)]
*  That's not a hypothetical. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  That's just American history. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=247.88s)]
*  And coming out of that, you're someone who's been a sort of historian of this period for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=249.68s)]
*  a lot of reasons. There was a there was a conclusion that Watergate was wrong and that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=254.12s)]
*  what Nixon did to the federal government was wrong. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=260.32s)]
*  And one of the readings of Roberts today is. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=262.92s)]
*  Watergate was not prosecutable, maybe. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  And what Nixon did as president, he probably was immune for. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=270.12s)]
*  And too bad that John Roberts wasn't around in 1974. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the executive sort of the imperial executive idea pioneered by Republican [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=280.0s)]
*  Justice Department officials like Ed Meese and brought to its sort of governing apex under [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=287.04s)]
*  Dick Cheney and the kinds of people who worked in Republican politics to approve the sorts of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  things that happened, particularly after 9-11 under the under the George W. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=297.16s)]
*  Bush White House. Those have now been brought by bringing a bunch of people who are part of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=301.44s)]
*  that, that cultural milieu in the legal world, by bringing them into a super majority in the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  Supreme Court. That has brought us to a place where a president has had his lawyers asked by a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  justice in open court. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  Are you saying your guy can assassinate someone and they have and he will have immunity for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  that? The answer was yes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  And the court wrote it down. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=325.52s)]
*  And that answer is the logical apex of where those things are, the nadir, I suppose, of where [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=327.92s)]
*  those things go over time. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=337.36s)]
*  But to have that radicalism land when you have a potential next term of Donald Trump on the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=339.68s)]
*  horizon if he wins in November, where he is saying exactly what he will do with this power is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=348.64s)]
*  quite a remarkable thing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=354.28s)]
*  You'll notice that nobody in reacting today's ruling is saying, wow, how scary. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=355.36s)]
*  What is Joe Biden going to do with this power? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=360.76s)]
*  Right. Nobody is saying that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=363.8s)]
*  Nobody is worried that a president like Joe Biden is going to, you know, abuse this in such a way [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=365.12s)]
*  that is going to bring about a de facto dictatorship. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=371.32s)]
*  But because that is what Trump is explicitly promising for any next term that he wins in the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  White House and this conservative court knows it and a third of it was appointed by him, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  they're doing this in the full context, the full knowledge of the radicalism of what they're [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=385.12s)]
*  bringing down upon the country. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=389.76s)]
*  And the only solution to this, the only way out of this is to have non criminals and non [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=391.64s)]
*  authoritarian minded would be dictators win presidential elections. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=399.12s)]
*  That is the only way to fix this, because if you have somebody who is a criminal or is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=404.04s)]
*  authoritarian minded, when they get in there armed with this ruling, there is nothing they [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=408.8s)]
*  cannot do. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  On that final point, the prospective implications of today's ruling are more profound in some [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=416.64s)]
*  ways and more unnerving than the retroactive ones because because I mean about about the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=423.92s)]
*  try and we're going to talk about this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=429.36s)]
*  What does it mean actually for the case that Jack Smith has, which is still alive, we should [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=430.56s)]
*  note, which I can think can actually they can cabin enough of this to bring that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=434.0s)]
*  We'll see and talk about it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=439.36s)]
*  Little. Yes. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  Little a little unclear, but the symbolic meaning to me is almost as important as the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=441.72s)]
*  legal meaning. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=448.36s)]
*  For the reasons that you say what it says to Trump, what it says to Republicans, what it's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=451.6s)]
*  I mean, the joke I made today was like John Roberts pulled down the American flag, turned [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=456.36s)]
*  it upside down and like hoisted it back up on the Supreme Court. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=461.8s)]
*  It felt to me like the opinion was like, we're with you on this. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=471.04s)]
*  Over and above its its findings, its holdings as a matter of constitutional law, it's it's [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=471.92s)]
*  sort of communicative aspect. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if the president the the the when when Donald Trump running for president [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=480.24s)]
*  in 2016 started leaving leading crowds and that lock her up chant the as shocking as [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=486.56s)]
*  it was to most of the country, it was a transgressive thrill to Trump and his followers [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=493.8s)]
*  because they knew it sounded so wrong. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  But they enjoyed that transgressive thrill so much that it became policy. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=504.36s)]
*  And we know that Trump, in fact, tried to get his Justice Department to bring improper [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=508.88s)]
*  politically motivated prosecutions against people while he was president and indeed to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=513.08s)]
*  improperly exclude him from federal investigation in the case that ultimately resulted in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=517.4s)]
*  state court in his 34 felony convictions in New York. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=521.84s)]
*  So we know that he is very, very fessel with this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=524.88s)]
*  This is what he wants to do. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=528.44s)]
*  This is what he thinks power should be. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=529.6s)]

*  Yeah, you can do that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=539.64s)]
*  We promise you explicitly in the ruling and the language of the ruling, not even in a [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYyzhIeuPV4&t=540.9200000000001s)]
