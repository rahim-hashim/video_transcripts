# JD Vance really, truly believes childless women are 'valueless'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg)
*  Is it me or does it feel like every day the Harris campaign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=0.0s)]
*  under some new clip of JD Vance repeating the same exact [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=3.92s)]
*  offensive ideas about childless women is not some gotcha [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  moment. Like the guy very clearly believes what he's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=10.88s)]
*  saying. It's it's not just a few childless cat lady moments [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=12.8s)]
*  here or there for years. Vance has been appearing on lots of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=15.52s)]
*  right wing bro podcasts talking about how women's only purpose [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  on this earth is to give birth to children and that if these [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=21.6s)]
*  women do not fulfill said purpose, they are both miserable [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=24.32s)]
*  and useless. We're effectively run in this country via the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=27.2s)]
*  Democrats via via our corporate oligarchs by a bunch of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=31.2s)]
*  childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=34.48s)]
*  the choices that they've made and so they want to make the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=37.28s)]
*  rest of the country miserable too. If you look at Kamala [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=39.6s)]
*  Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=41.68s)]
*  Democrats is controlled by people without children and how [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=45.76s)]
*  does it make any sense that we've turned our country over [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  to people who don't really have a direct stake in it? You go [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  on Twitter and almost always the people who are most [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  deranged and most psychotic are people who don't have kids [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  at home. So many of the leaders of the left, I hate to be so [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=60.16s)]
*  personal about this, but they're people without kids trying [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=63.44s)]
*  to brainwash the minds of our children. Randy Winegarden, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=65.84s)]
*  who's the head of the most powerful teaching union in the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=69.52s)]
*  country, she doesn't have a single child. If she wants to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=71.6s)]
*  brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=74.56s)]
*  some of her own and leave ours to hell alone. Now, we just got [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=77.28s)]
*  another one. This is JD Vance on a podcast in 2021. I'm [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=80.72s)]
*  going to play it for you at length because I think it's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=84.08s)]
*  really worth hearing the Republican nominee, vice [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  president, fully explain this worldview. What elite culture [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=88.16s)]
*  does, what these elite institutions do is they take [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=93.28s)]
*  some very smart people in our society, they filter them into [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=96.72s)]
*  a very small place and they basically tell them to want the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=100.08s)]
*  same things. Clerkships, law firm jobs, consulting gigs, you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=103.44s)]
*  know, nice cushy jobs at private equity firms and they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=108.88s)]
*  tell them that the only way they're going to be happy is to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=112.64s)]
*  get those things and so those people end up focusing on [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=114.96s)]
*  career and on credential at the expense of the things that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=118.88s)]
*  actually make people happy and so you have people at Yale [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=121.6s)]
*  Law School, you have women who think that truly the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=125.12s)]
*  liberationist path is to spend 90 hours a week working in a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  cubicle at McKinsey instead of starting a family and having [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=131.92s)]
*  children. To me, what it is is is sort of a value system to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=134.8s)]
*  replace the fact that they're all fundamentally atheist or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=138.48s)]
*  agnostic. They have no real value system. Their only value [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  system is achieve in a very conventional way and so the idea [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=143.92s)]
*  that somehow they're pursuing racial or gender equity is like [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  the value system that gives their life meaning. Clearly, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=154.72s)]
*  this value set has made me a miserable person who can't have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=157.76s)]
*  kids because I already, you know, passed the biological [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=162.56s)]
*  period when it was possible and I live in a 1200 square foot [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=164.88s)]
*  apartment in New York and I pay $5000 a month for it, but [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=168.16s)]
*  I'm really better than these other people. What I'm going to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=171.44s)]
*  do is project my like racial and gender sensitivities on the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=175.6s)]
*  rest of them and like the reason that our society is broken [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  is because these people don't think the exact way that I [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=183.12s)]
*  think even though the way that I think it's made me a miserable [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=185.2s)]
*  person. I just need to make more people think like that just [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=187.28s)]
*  the women you notice the guys that were 90 hours a week in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=190.8s)]
*  McKinsey. That's great. I guess it's no accident JD Vance [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=194.4s)]
*  repeated these ideas so often he was speaking to a specific [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=197.2s)]
*  audience as he auditioned for a role as a future Republican [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  Party and the spot he now holds on the ticket, you know, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  influential people on the right Tucker Carlson those in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's inner circle. They agree with Vance. It's how [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  he got where he is now. In fact, we have new reporting that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  shows just how close Vance has been to the creators and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=212.72s)]
*  visionaries behind the project 2025 from the very beginning or [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=215.76s)]
*  more on that next. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=220.16s)]
*  Donald Trump keeps insisting he and his campaign have nothing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=224.08s)]
*  to do with project 2025 JD Vance makes that extremely [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=227.12s)]
*  difficult to believe as the New York Times uncovered back in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=230.56s)]
*  2017, the Heritage Foundation, the right wing group behind [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  project 2025 put out an equally weird series of essays [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=236.24s)]
*  lambasting IVF and abortion rights scapegoating the poor [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=239.36s)]
*  called the index of culture and opportunity. We'll never guess [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=242.72000000000003s)]
*  who wrote that introduction to that report and delivered the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  keynote speech at his public release. What we're less [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=248.08s)]
*  comfortable talking about is this question of culture and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=252.32s)]
*  that's what I think is so important about this index and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=255.2s)]
*  about the conversation we're having today. We're recognizing [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=258.08s)]
*  the importance of culture and most of all, we're recognizing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=260.88s)]
*  that it influences the opportunities that children who [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=263.76s)]
*  grew up in the circumstances that I grew up in that it that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=266.32s)]
*  it affects their their opportunities. Shelgo Lerg is an [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=269.28s)]
*  opinion columnist from the New York Times and she joins me [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=272.96s)]
*  now. You know that we I remember the childless cat lady [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=275.12s)]
*  comment on Tucker Carlson at the time as being like really [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=277.92s)]
*  gross and offensive, but you could be forgiven for thinking [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=280.48s)]
*  like oh he's trying to play up to Tucker. Right. You think [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=283.68s)]
*  it's funny that he says something stupid sometimes and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=286.16s)]
*  now it's like every other day. It's a fix and it's the way [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=288.16s)]
*  that he started his go to insult right because it's it's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=291.92s)]
*  about different kinds of people. It's about politicians. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=294.88s)]
*  Oh they're I hate them because they're they're so they're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=297.44s)]
*  corrupt because they're childless. They're not [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  invested in the future. It's teachers. It's journalists, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=300.8s)]
*  right. It's lawyers. It's kind of his go to expression of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  contempt is to say that this group of people globally is [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=307.12s)]
*  childless. Yes and what's striking about it like in that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=311.44s)]
*  riff that we played you know in the in the previous block, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  you're right here for it. If you took gender out of it, you [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  said look elite culture just like tells people that oh the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=320.08s)]
*  most important thing is like these getting these these you [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=323.44s)]
*  know grabbing the brass ring and working all the time. I'd [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=325.52s)]
*  be like yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah and like that's not [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=327.52s)]
*  great and there's more to life than that, but it's always [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=329.76s)]
*  women. It's always women. It's women women women. Oh now [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=332.32s)]
*  remember he is married. He's talking about getting these [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=335.92s)]
*  clerkships becoming a corporate lawyer. I mean that was his [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=338.72s)]
*  wife. He's talking about his wife right literally until this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=341.44s)]
*  summer when she you know she quit her job after he became [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=344.16s)]
*  the vice presidential nominee and yes and he it is with this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=347.04s)]
*  story. It's interesting because when some of the original [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=350.0s)]
*  childless cat lady's comments, he said well, I wasn't talking [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  about people who can't have children. I was talking about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=354.48s)]
*  people who choose not to have children now. He's very [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  explicitly talking about people who can't have children, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=358.48s)]
*  right because he says the your biological window has closed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=361.12s)]
*  right and so it's this you know I didn't read Hillelilge [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=363.92s)]
*  when it came out and so I didn't read it through the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=367.92s)]
*  filter of the discourse at the time I read it when he [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=369.76s)]
*  reemerged as a presidential bird vice presidential prospect [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=373.36s)]
*  and that is a book that just seeds with anger right and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=377.12s)]

*  because we think embryos are full human beings and you know [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=464.72s)]

*  could circumvent the natural life course that we have to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=485.2s)]

*  right that there's a sort of weirdness. I mean Donald Trump's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  problem. Donald Trump has his own problem with women but it's [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=517.6s)]
*  more like his kind of desire to like molest and objectify them [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=520.24s)]
*  as irrepressible whereas JD Vance's desire to condemn and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=523.84s)]
*  control them is what's irrepressible and people I think [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  they get that from him. Yeah and I do think it's it's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  interesting to think about the degree to which the Harris [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=533.04s)]
*  Walls campaign has more like how like they're just like [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=536.8s)]
*  sitting on some enormous podcast stockpile because [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=540.24s)]
*  every day there's a new one. You know I mean I've said this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  on the show before I still think that we don't pay nearly [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=545.92s)]
*  enough attention to the fact that JD Vance blurbed a book [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  that came out this summer calling for fascism like [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  literally you know praising Francisco Franco and talking [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=555.92s)]
*  about how democracy isn't enough to destroy the kind of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  subhuman class. I mean it's this really vicious book. I do [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=562.88s)]
*  think that there's so much JD Vance has just done. He spent [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=566.08s)]
*  so much time in that nether world that there is probably an [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=569.2s)]
*  inexhaustible supply. Yeah and it's also that the final point [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=573.36s)]
*  on this which I think is important is this stuff isn't [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=577.44s)]
*  accidental like him making the tour of podcast bros to go talk [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  about this stuff is not unconnected to him getting the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  gig. Oh right like that's that was the audition and that was [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  also his path out of like never trumpism into the heart of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=592.72s)]
*  my god. Yes. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcX_pHaGxg&t=596.88s)]
