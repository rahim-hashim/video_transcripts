# Sen. Chris Murphy reacts to Supreme Court overturning ban on gun bump stocks
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY)
*  Today we got confirmation that the Supreme Court is fully in the pocket of the far right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, they're even further to the right than former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=5.8s)]
*  In 2017, a gunman opened fire on a crowd of people at a music festival in Las Vegas. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=10.88s)]
*  More than 850 people were injured and 60 died. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=17.2s)]
*  The shooter managed to fire 1,000 rounds in about 11 minutes because 12 of his rifles [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=21.52s)]
*  were outfitted with bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire bullets faster. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=26.96s)]
*  In the aftermath and under pressure, the Trump administration enacted a ban on bump stocks. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=33.92s)]
*  But today, the Supreme Court ruled that one small protection against gun violence was too much, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=39.92s)]
*  striking down the ban. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=46.32s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy is a Democrat from Connecticut. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=49.0s)]
*  He's one of the leading voices in the fight against gun violence, and he joins me now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Senator, I want to thank you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=56.48s)]
*  As someone who has been frighteningly close to multiple mass shootings at multiple universities [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=59.92s)]
*  that I have attended and worked at, I want to personally thank you for the work that you have done [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=67.28s)]
*  about this epidemic and this crisis in this country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=72.56s)]
*  I'll start with this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  What is your reaction to the Supreme Court's just naked dismissal of the gun crisis that our country is in right now? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=76.56s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=86.48s)]
*  I'm sorry for your experience. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=88.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, it is not the exception these days. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=89.84s)]
*  It is the norm. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Listen, the Supreme Court got it wrong, plain and simple. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=93.92s)]
*  And it's yet another decision from this Supreme Court that makes it clear that they are on their way [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=97.68s)]
*  to a radical rewriting of the ability for Congress and the ability of the executive branch [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=103.44s)]
*  to keep our communities safe. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=109.76s)]
*  Listen, everybody who knows anything about a bump stock knows that it effectively turns [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic weapon through a single pull of the trigger. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=116.8s)]
*  You can fire multiple rounds. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=122.56s)]
*  That is the definition in law of a machine gun, and the Supreme Court should have allowed for this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=125.44s)]
*  regulation put in place by the Trump administration to stay as law. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=132.88s)]
*  And now with this ruling, once again, you are going to be able to have very deranged individuals [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=137.52s)]
*  like the Las Vegas shooter once again be able to easily modify a semi-automatic weapon [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=144.24s)]
*  in which you can get off 60 rounds per minute and modify it into an automatic weapon in which you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  are firing off multiple hundreds of rounds a minute. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  And that means in these mass shootings, more and more people will die. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=161.12s)]
*  Lives are going to be cost by the decision of the Supreme Court today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  Senator, I feel like we've been saying this a lot over the last five or six years, and unfortunately [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=169.84s)]
*  maybe saying it for another 30 or 40. How do we work around the Supreme Court? Because it seems [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=174.56s)]
*  like every time Congress or elected officials make some effort, they cut it off at the knees. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  What can other branches do in order to sort of provide some gun safety for Americans if the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=185.28s)]
*  court is consistently opposed? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=190.88s)]
*  Senator John M. Bumstock, Jr. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=193.2s)]
*  So it is important to note that this decision on Bumstock's is actually not a decision [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  on the scope of the Second Amendment. The Bruin decision, which is a decision from [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  a prior conservative court, did reinterpret the Second Amendment and creates a really confusing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=206.32s)]
*  new test for district courts in which they have to look at the historical precedence of regulating [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=213.28s)]
*  firearms in this country, which of course is very difficult when you have technologies changing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=219.44s)]
*  very fast. But as it stands today, the Supreme Court has not fundamentally overruled the Heller [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=224.24s)]
*  decision. And the Heller decision says that things like universal background checks and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=231.12s)]
*  restrictions on weapons like assault weapons are still legal. Now, the Supreme Court may [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=236.4s)]
*  eventually overrule Heller. But for the time being, when states pass assault weapons bans, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=242.0s)]
*  they are largely upheld by the courts. And unquestionably, when states or the federal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=246.96s)]
*  government expands background check requirements, which is the intervention that saves the most [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=251.68s)]
*  lives in this country, those are upheld by the courts as well. So we have to be worried about [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=256.64s)]
*  the Supreme Court, but we can pass new laws today and they will pass constitutional musters. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=261.68s)]
*  So there's no reason for us to wait to pass an assault weapons ban or universal background [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=267.2s)]
*  checks. Let's worry about the court down the line. Let's just choose to save lives right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=272.08s)]
*  Speaking of the court, one of the most consistent stories we've seen pretty much since last summer [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=277.44s)]
*  is that we have one particular member of the court, many of whom are compromised, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=282.4s)]
*  but one particular member of the court, Clarence Thomas, has consistently been shown to be basically [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=285.92s)]
*  in the pocket of a Bond villain, Harlan Crowe. I mean, he is the puppeteer for everything Clarence [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=291.04s)]
*  Thomas seems to do. He is the Jim Henson to his Kermit. And that is affecting our ability to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=296.8s)]
*  not just pass legislation, but have that legislation respected. What kinds of reforms [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  do you think the president and Democrats and Republicans who care about democracy should [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  be trying to initiate now to rein this court in and weed out this kind of compromise and corrupt [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=312.96s)]
*  justices? Yeah, I mean, this is a straight up grift, right? There's no question what is happening [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=318.64s)]
*  here. Harlan Crowe, who is one of the most politically involved multimillionaires or [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=327.12s)]
*  billionaires in the country, who has got a clear political agenda, who has multiple interests before [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=332.88s)]
*  the court, is paying off Clarence Thomas in a multitude of different ways, giving him lavish [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=338.16s)]
*  trips, paying the rent of his mother. We probably have only under covered the tip of the amount of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=345.12s)]
*  money that Harlan Crowe is directing to Clarence Thomas. And he is not doing that because they are [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=352.08s)]
*  best buddies. This is not a legacy relationship that goes back to their childhood days. He only [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  started giving Clarence Thomas money once Clarence Thomas got in a position to rule on Harlan Crowe's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=362.64s)]
*  interests. What can we do? Well, we can take a look at Supreme Court reform. There are really [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=368.56s)]
*  interesting proposals that would limit the terms of Supreme Court justices. We can impose a statutory [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  code of conduct that would require these justices to report these interactions that would ban these [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=380.16s)]
*  kind of gifts and would have consequences if they violate the law. So we are not powerless to try to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  do something about this just extraordinary corruption that specifically Justice Thomas is [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  involved in and we should get moving on it. And listen, I don't know why this has become a partisan [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=400.72s)]
*  issue. Why do Democrats only care about the corporate corruption of the court? Republicans [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=404.8s)]
*  should care about this too. Exactly. Senator Chris Murphy, thank you so much for your time and coming [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=410.16s)]
*  on tonight on All In. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=414.56s)]
*  you [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWBeFTa8GY&t=434.8s)]
