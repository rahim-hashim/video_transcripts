# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today, one day after the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year-old law outlawing nearly all abortions, Republicans in that state's legislature threw away a chance to repeal the wildly unpopular ban. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=0.0s)]
*  Arizona Democrats, who are a slim minority just barely in the Senate, tried to bring up legislation that would repeal the 1864 law, and in some sense is calling the bluff for Republicans who said, oh, this is terrible. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=17.0s)]
*  And yet what happened? Republican leaders in the statehouse removed the bill from the agenda. In the House, Republicans called for a recess before any votes could be cast on a similar bill. Democrats quickly reproached their Republican colleagues on the floor. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=29.0s)]
*  Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=44.0s)]
*  Blood on your hands! Blood on your hands! Blood on your hands! Shame! Shame! [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=55.0s)]
*  Arizona is now set to be ground zero and what will be the first true nationwide abortion [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=66.0s)]
*  election in this nation's history. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=73.66s)]
*  It's the product of 50 years of anti-abortion activism by the Republican Party and conservatives. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=76.42s)]
*  For half a century, Republicans have kind of argued out of both sides of their mouths [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=81.22s)]
*  about reproductive rights. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=85.42s)]
*  This is important to understand. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=86.42s)]
*  So in one side, right, they called abortion murder, your baby killers, and they claimed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=87.9s)]
*  that fertilized eggs are full human persons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=93.58s)]
*  At the same time, they claim that their real objection to the right to an abortion, as [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=96.76s)]
*  enshrined in the Supreme Court's decision, Roe v. Wade, was that it prevented Americans [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  from voting on the issue. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=105.86s)]
*  They said it should be left to the states and to the democratic process. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=107.32s)]
*  Well, thanks to the successful efforts of the Republican anti-abortion movement and Donald [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=110.8s)]
*  Trump and his conservative majority on the Supreme Court, abortion rights have been kicked [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=116.18s)]
*  back to the states. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  The right to safe and legal reproductive care is now up in the air in every state in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=122.34s)]
*  the nation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=127.14s)]
*  Since the Supreme Court's decision over turning Roe, abortion rights have been explicitly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  on the ballot in statewide referenda or initiatives in six states and in every single one. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  The pro-abortion right side won. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=138.58s)]
*  Even conservative states, states that Donald Trump won, like Kansas and Kentucky and Ohio, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  where Republicans pulled out every trick in the book to stop it from even getting on the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=145.82s)]
*  ballot. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=149.06s)]
*  Arizona now will have this on the ballot in the fall. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=150.06s)]
*  It's expected to be next, along with several others, including Florida. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=153.26s)]
*  And of course, now this year, for the first time since the Supreme Court overturned Roe, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=156.98s)]
*  we are facing a national presidential election. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=161.74s)]
*  On one side, we have the man who nearly single-handedly destroyed Roe v. Wade, as he will be the absolute [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=164.18s)]
*  first to tell you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal scholars [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=175.1s)]
*  both sides wanted and in fact demanded be ended. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=180.7s)]
*  Roe v. Wade. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=185.54s)]
*  For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated and I did it and I'm proud [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=187.26s)]
*  to have done it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=192.84s)]
*  Roe v. Wade, I did something that nobody thought was possible and Roe v. Wade was terminated, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=193.84s)]
*  was put back to the states. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=198.74s)]
*  Point of fact there, not all legal scholars on both sides wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=200.26s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=204.98s)]
*  Now, on the other side of this election, there's a Democratic president, Joe Biden, who promises [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=205.98s)]
*  explicitly to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land through legislation if he's able [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  to work with the Democratic House and Senate. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=217.26s)]
*  The thing about all this is, and it's really wild to watch this, I got to say, I don't [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  think I've ever quite seen something like this in my 20 years covering American politics. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=224.62s)]
*  Republicans, at least the ones with like a modicum of sense, understand they are in desperate [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=229.38s)]
*  trouble on this issue. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=234.74s)]
*  It is just clear as day that voters are not in line with their position on abortion. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=235.94s)]
*  So they're just running around saying anything they can to anyone, just trying to like run [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  away from themselves, from their own position. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump is the prime example. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=250.58s)]
*  In a recent statement, desperately trying to create some distance from the political [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=254.3s)]
*  catastrophe of his own making that he keeps bragging about, he said he supported leaving [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=257.58s)]
*  abortion rights up to the states. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=262.64000000000004s)]
*  Of course, that includes states like Mississippi, where a 13-year-old who's the victim of rape [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=264.64000000000004s)]
*  has to give birth to her rapist child. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=268.64000000000004s)]
*  And this comes after Trump spent years just flip-flopping all over the place on the issue. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, look, I'm very pro-choice. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=278.04s)]
*  I am strongly for choice, and yet I hate the concept of abortion. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=282.8s)]
*  But you would not ban it? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  I used to not be pro-life. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  I've become pro-life. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=291.6s)]
*  I build buildings. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=292.6s)]
*  They're not asking me about am I pro-choice? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=293.6s)]
*  Am I pro-life? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=295.8s)]
*  What am I? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  But yeah, I don't use the word flip. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=298.12s)]
*  I've evolved on a lot of different things. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=300.88s)]
*  I mean, as you know, I'm pro-life. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=303.12s)]
*  I have been pro-life. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=306.88s)]
*  For the woman? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=310.88s)]
*  Yeah, there has to be some form. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=311.88s)]
*  Again, pick any position. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  He said it at some point. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=315.64000000000004s)]
*  None of that matters. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't matter what he says. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=318.44s)]
*  Remember, Republicans are trying to hide their true position. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  And the ones that are trying to hide their position, like Trump, those are the ones who [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  know that they need to actually win an election. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=327.12s)]
*  But if you listen to conservatives who don't need to win votes, well, then they sound like [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=329.72s)]
*  this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=335.68s)]
*  If you had to travel to another state to get an abortion, it's not the worst thing in the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  world. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  Hopefully, this is a very rare occurrence in your life. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  Once in your life, maybe you would do it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=344.04s)]
*  Buying a bus ticket to go somewhere to get it is not the worst thing in the world. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=346.04s)]
*  Come on, cheer up, toots. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=349.72s)]
*  Just a bus ticket. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=352.0s)]
*  Just a bus ticket. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=354.72s)]
*  Just get on a bus. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=355.72s)]
*  15 years old, victim of sexual assault. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=356.72s)]
*  Get on a bus. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  Figure it out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  Maybe this happens once and most twice. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  That's what they think. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=364.8s)]
*  Remember, no matter what Donald Trump or anyone else says, this Republican Party is devoted [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  to completely eliminating bodily autonomy for all American women as a matter of fervent, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=373.8s)]
*  zealous belief. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=380.48s)]
*  And they will not stop until they are definitively politically defeated over and over and over [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=381.64s)]
*  until it's ground out of them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=389.18s)]
*  And believe me, they have the tools to accomplish this, robbing women of their full bodily autonomy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=391.66s)]
*  at every level. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=395.68s)]
*  They have it in the judiciary, in state judiciaries, federal judiciary, in state legislatures, in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=396.68s)]
*  governor's mansions. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=401.44s)]
*  And if they win the presidency this November, they will control a federal government that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=403.08s)]
*  they can, for instance, order the FDA to overturn the approval of abortion medication like methamphet [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=406.4s)]
*  pristone, take it off the shelves. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=412.08s)]
*  They can revive another 19th century law still on the books, which is basically just like [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=413.64s)]
*  fallen into disrepute and not used, called the Comstock Act, which, and I quote it here, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=419.24s)]
*  outlaws mail in quote, every article or thing designed, adapted or intended for producing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=424.24s)]
*  abortion. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=428.6s)]
*  That would mean the federal mail would shut down all the shipping of anything related [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=429.6s)]
*  to abortion. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=433.92s)]
*  How do you think that would work? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=434.92s)]
*  What do you think that would do? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=435.92s)]
*  And you may be saying, well, it sounds a little far-fetched to just thaw out a dormant law [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=438.44s)]
*  from the 1800s to attack abortion rights, but that's exactly what they literally just [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  did in the Arizona Supreme Court yesterday. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=447.6s)]
*  So we are now seeing the spectacle of Arizona Republicans running for office, twisting themselves [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=452.36s)]
*  into knots. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=459.44s)]
*  Take for instance, this candidate, you know her, Carrie Lake. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=460.92s)]
*  She lost the race for governor to Katie Hobson in 2022, though she never conceded. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=465.26s)]
*  She is now running for Senate against Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=470.16s)]
*  Yesterday, in the wake of that disastrous Arizona Supreme Court decision, she put out this statement, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=473.88s)]
*  desperately trying to run away from what she knows is the wrong side of the issue. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=478.88s)]
*  She can read a poll, quote, I oppose today's ruling. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=482.78s)]
*  I'm calling on Katie Hobs. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=485.48s)]
*  That's a funny one. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=486.96s)]
*  Oh, I guess Katie Hobs is the governor now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=488.44s)]
*  So you're not the governor? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=490.52s)]
*  I'm calling on Katie Hobs and the state legislature to come up with an immediate common sense [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=491.52s)]
*  solution Arizonans can support. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  Of course, her party blocked that today. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=498.04s)]
*  And that statement, which was fine as these statements go, would be slightly more credible [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=502.26s)]
*  if Carrie Lake hadn't explicitly endorsed the very same 1864 law on stage into a microphone [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  on camera just two years ago. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=516.4s)]
*  Obviously, I think Roe v. Wade should be overturned. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=519.48s)]
*  And I think the Supreme Court, I have a good feeling that they're going to do the right [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=522.36s)]
*  thing this time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=525.82s)]
*  We have a great law on the books right now. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=526.82s)]
*  If that happens, we will be a state where we will not be taking the lives of our unborn [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=528.36s)]
*  anymore. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=534.2s)]
*  We have a great law on the books right now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=535.46s)]
*  So this is what the abortion election looks like. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=541.08s)]
*  As Election Day approaches, Republicans like Carrie Lake will continue to lie about their [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=544.74s)]
*  own positions because they understand how toxic they are, but make no mistake, they [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=549.3000000000001s)]
*  have already shown us and continue to show us every day what they do when they have power. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=555.46s)]
*  Donald Trump has a long history making anti-Semitic remarks, in particular invoking the dual loyalty [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=562.82s)]
*  stereotype which implies Jewish Americans must care about some other loyalty they have, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  their religion or the state of Israel and its politics, more than they care about domestic [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=574.46s)]
*  issues in the U.S. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=578.0200000000001s)]
*  When he said, your prime minister, he was talking to American Jews, he's their president. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=579.0200000000001s)]
*  It's been especially true in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=583.5400000000001s)]
*  Just today, the ex-president again invoked this stereotype in an attack on President Joe Biden. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=587.28s)]
*  He has abandoned Israel. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=592.28s)]
*  He's totally abandoned Israel. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=595.28s)]
*  And frankly, you know, he's a low IQ individual. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=597.28s)]
*  He has no idea where he is and who he's supporting. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=600.28s)]
*  He doesn't know if he's supporting the Palestinians, but he knows one thing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=603.28s)]
*  He is not supporting Israel. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=607.28s)]
*  He has abandoned Israel. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=609.28s)]
*  And any Jewish person that votes for a Democrat or votes for Biden should have their head examined. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=611.28s)]
*  Now, this comes at a time when Democrats, President Biden, progressives, Jewish Americans [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=616.28s)]
*  of all different stripes are engaged in intense debate over the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=620.28s)]
*  the conduct of the war under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the path forward. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=626.28s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, is one of a handful of Jewish senators who's [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=631.28s)]
*  been particularly outspoken about the crisis in Gaza. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=635.28s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=638.28s)]
*  I don't think you're going to take any head examination advice from the former president, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=640.28s)]
*  but I suspect you don't think your head needs to be examined as you've been very vocally critical of the conduct. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=645.28s)]
*  Well, it probably does, but not for the reasons that Trump articulates. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=650.28s)]
*  Fair. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=653.28s)]
*  But that's another story. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=654.28s)]
*  Look, you have a president who is a pathological liar, who spends his life trying to divide us up in every which way, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=656.28s)]
*  who apparently has no compassion within his DNA. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=666.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm Jewish. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=671.28s)]
*  I'm proud to be Jewish. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=672.28s)]
*  But it doesn't matter whether you're Jewish, whether you're Christian, whether you're Muslim or whatever you are. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=673.28s)]
*  If you take a look at what is going on in Gaza today, your heart is breaking. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=678.28s)]
*  And you're looking at one of the most horrific humanitarian disasters in the modern history of this country. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=684.28s)]
*  Chris, as we chat here tonight, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza are starving. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=692.28s)]
*  The New York Times documented last week, last week, that 28 children there have died of malnutrition. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=700.28s)]
*  I think that number is way, way lower than reality. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=708.28s)]
*  So we are sitting here while children are dying, starving, they're dying of malnutrition. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=712.28s)]
*  Gaza has been demolished. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=717.28s)]
*  The housing units have been destroyed. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=718.28s)]
*  1.8 million people have been taken from their homes, put on the road, not knowing where they're going, living in unsafe, horrible conditions. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=721.28s)]
*  That is the reality. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=730.28s)]
*  And it really does amaze me that people like Trump could care less, could care less that hundreds of thousands of human beings, children, are starving to death. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=732.28s)]
*  And he uses this moment for his stupid politics to tell us how much he loves Benjamin Netanyahu, who is the architect of this disastrous policy. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=745.28s)]
*  I want to play for you something the president said about Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=754.28s)]
*  It's very clear that there is tension and conflict between them about this point. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=758.28s)]
*  They had a conversation the other day after the airstrike that killed the aid workers for World Central Kitchen. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=762.28s)]
*  This is what in an interview with the Univision, President Biden had to say about Netanyahu. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=768.28s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=774.28s)]
*  What I will tell you is I think what he's doing is a mistake. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=776.28s)]
*  I don't agree with his approach. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=779.28s)]
*  I think it's outrageous that those four or three vehicles were hit by drones and taken out on a highway where it wasn't like it was along the shore. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=781.28s)]
*  It wasn't like there was a convoy moving here, et cetera. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=792.28s)]
*  So I'm what I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call for ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks total access to all food and medicine going into the country. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=796.28s)]
*  What do you think of that position, sir? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=814.28s)]
*  Well, I think the president is absolutely right. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=817.28s)]
*  There's got to be a ceasefire right now. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=819.28s)]
*  And there has got to be the world has got to respond to this horrific emergency. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=821.28s)]
*  I mean, a few days ago, Biden talked to Netanyahu. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=827.28s)]
*  Apparently, he got some commitments from him to open up the borders more to allow more humanitarian aid. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=834.28s)]
*  The New York Times just reported a few hours ago that that may not be happening or happening to any significant degree. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=841.28s)]
*  So I think the president is right. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=847.28s)]
*  There's got to be a ceasefire. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=848.28s)]
*  The world has got to respond in a in a dramatic way to get food to starving people. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=850.28s)]
*  It's only food when children are dying of malnutrition. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=856.28s)]
*  It's not just food. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=859.28s)]
*  You need certain types of food. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=860.28s)]
*  The medical facilities have been destroyed. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=861.28s)]
*  But I'll tell you this also, Chris, we have the president is wrong. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=864.28s)]
*  You don't have to be begging that Yahoo to doing anything. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=867.28s)]
*  We are supplying and have supplied Israel with huge amounts of money for decades. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=870.28s)]
*  Right now, there is legislation that would give Israel and I voted against that legislation. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=876.28s)]
*  Ten billion dollars more for unfettered military aid. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=881.28s)]
*  The president has got to say, sorry, Netanyahu, you are not getting one penny more until that situation in Gaza radically changes. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=885.28s)]
*  We're not begging you anymore. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=893.28s)]
*  We're telling you you want money. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=894.28s)]
*  That's what you got to do. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=896.28s)]
*  End of discussion. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=897.28s)]
*  I want to ask you about a development that's happened over the last few days and then just reporting your time. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=898.28s)]
*  Obviously, for months now, they've been talking about some kind of deal, some sort of ceasefire deal. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=902.28s)]
*  And obviously, of the utmost importance from the Israeli side are the hostages. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=906.28s)]
*  We don't know how many of those hostages are alive. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=910.28s)]
*  We just don't know the number. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=913.28s)]
*  And this harrowing headline today, which suggests some real complications here, Hamas does not have 40 hostages who meet terms of potential swap with Israel, officials said. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=916.28s)]
*  Senior Hamas officials said on Wednesday they don't have the 40 living hostages in Gaza who meet the criteria for an exchange. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=926.28s)]
*  You know, obviously any deal has to have some reciprocity and hostage release is one of them. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=931.28s)]
*  And now you've got Hamas saying we don't have them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=936.28s)]
*  Look, this is a nightmare on top of a nightmare. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=940.28s)]
*  I mean, I read that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=943.28s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=946.28s)]
*  Who knows how they died, why they died? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=948.28s)]
*  But obviously, you're absolutely right. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=951.28s)]
*  Our hostage exchange people now have been held under terrible conditions for months. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=954.28s)]
*  And Israel has a right to demand their release. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=960.28s)]
*  And that has got to be part of any package. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=963.28s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmirdAP2Eg&t=966.28s)]
