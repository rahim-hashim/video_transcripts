# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 20
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q)
*  This week as Donald Trump faces a possible indictment related to that very attack on January 6th, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  many Senate Republicans who also had to flee to safety that day are still out defending him. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=5.84s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, the Democrat of Connecticut, was in the Capitol that day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=12.72s)]
*  He joins me now. Senator, good to see you in person. We talk a lot but not often face to face. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=16.48s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=20.88s)]
*  I will never not be fascinated by folks whose lives were endangered on January 6th by this mob [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=22.48s)]
*  in many cases we can clearly acknowledge, encouraged by President Trump, who don't seem [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=29.68s)]
*  to be able to want him to hold to be held to account for that. Does any of what has happened [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  this week surprise you? I mean I thought at one point Republicans would take the exit ramp, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=41.36s)]
*  but say all right this is the second time he's had a federal indictment. This is really kind [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  of crazy. We need to break with him. Yeah listen I think you need to understand that there is a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=48.72s)]
*  growing element of the Republican Party that is no longer supportive of democracy. They believe [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=52.8s)]
*  their leader, right? They are part of this cult of personality and they are willing to throw out [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=59.12s)]
*  democracy in order to keep their people and their guy in power. What was most extraordinary that day [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=64.56s)]
*  on January 6th is that after the attack was over Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, my colleagues had an [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=70.64s)]
*  opportunity to stand down to say we're not going to inflame this movement by continuing our protest [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  of an election that everybody knew was solid and yet they went forward with their contest and we [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=83.28s)]
*  still had to have a vote later that night to shut down the insurrectionist attempt by our colleagues. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=89.52s)]
*  So I just think you have to understand that there are a bunch of Republican leaders, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  the vast majority, the vast minority of Republican senators, but really important guys in the party [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=102.72s)]
*  who actually are willing to get rid of democracy if that's what it takes to get Trump back in power. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=109.84s)]
*  I mean look in fairness to Mitch McConnell, he has been the best at generally distancing himself [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=113.92s)]
*  from Donald Trump or saying opaque things about how maybe Donald Trump is not the best guy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=121.92s)]
*  to be the candidate. Why the thrall, particularly with the United States Senators who don't work [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=125.84s)]
*  on the same electoral cycles as the presidency, they have the ability, they're statewide elected, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=130.8s)]
*  they've got a broader base generally. We know why we see some of this in the House, it's structural. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=136.32s)]
*  Why in the Senate do you have colleagues who do this? Well so listen I think this is an opportunity [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=141.92s)]
*  for us to take a step back. Listen everybody that stormed the Capitol that violated the law [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=146.64s)]
*  should be held accountable but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a reckoning with the country [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=151.84s)]
*  as to why so many people are willing and were willing to throw out democracy and to essentially [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=156.48s)]
*  install an autocrat. Part of that is because there is a real unhappiness with democracy. There [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=162.48s)]
*  is a real belief that it has been used to protect the elites and that doesn't excuse insurrection, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  that doesn't excuse political violence but it is important for us to recognize that there is a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  growing number of Americans, almost all of them on the right but a handful on the left, who are kind of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  ready to entertain other offers besides democracy because democracy isn't delivering and that's a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=185.44s)]
*  really important conversation for us to have. Really important. Germany in 1933 was looking to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=191.04s)]
*  embrace another offer. Italy under Mussolini was looking to embrace another offer. These are people [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=196.88s)]
*  who had the vote, who made choices for this. So there's a little bit of empathy coming out in you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  here, something that maybe some of our viewers are not willing to hear. What do you do about that? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=207.2s)]
*  If what you're saying is true, does that feel like a reach out? What are you saying about people who [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  are that frustrated that they would choose to overturn democracy? Yeah, I don't have any empathy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=217.68s)]
*  for people who chose to storm the Capitol on January 6th but I also think it's a mistake for us [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=222.16s)]
*  to ignore the underlying causes of this unrest with democracy because it exists not just with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=227.28s)]
*  people who are engaging in political violence, it exists with a lot of folks who are never going to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  engage in that kind of activity but may choose through the vote to throw out this form of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=238.64s)]
*  government. And so that's frankly why this week I introduced a bill that sets up an office to study [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=243.6s)]
*  the epidemic of American social isolation and loneliness because I bet you a lot of the people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=250.0s)]
*  who are part of Trump's movement are really lonely people who have been unable to find positive [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=256.32s)]
*  identity and positive meaning because we've had the power of family and work and community atrophy [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=261.44s)]
*  and so they're searching out for any meaning and identity they can find and they find it often in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  really dark dangerous places like demagogic movements like the one led by Donald Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  So I think we've got to start studying these sort of underlying anxieties in this country like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  loneliness and isolation, trying to give people more positive connection, places where they can [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=284.55999999999995s)]
*  find friends and people to connect with and I think that is one of the ways in which we prevent [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  another January. Yeah unfortunately social media was apparently also trying to find people friends [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=296.4s)]
*  who were otherwise thinking up conspiracy theories on their own. This is a good long-term solution [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  in between now and when what you're hoping to do gets done we may have a presidential election in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=307.84s)]
*  which Donald Trump gets stronger with each indictment it seems. Well and listen that's why [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  in the short term we do have to shore up our democracy right? We have to move forward with [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=318.4s)]
*  laws to protect the right to vote and protect the ability to count the vote. We made a pretty good [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=323.36s)]
*  step forward at the end of the last congress. We rewrote the electoral count act so some of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=329.2s)]
*  tricks that Trump and his lawyers tried to pull will be much less likely and we can do more. So [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=334.32s)]
*  we need to walk and chew gum at the same time try to address these long-term sources of American [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=339.6s)]
*  anxiety, the reasons that people are walking away from democracy but also try to make it a lot harder [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=345.36s)]
*  for Trump and his allies to steal the election. Is it your sense that it would be harder because [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=350.88s)]
*  Jamie Raskin said to us on Tuesday night the best predictor of a successful coup is a failed coup. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=354.96s)]
*  If Donald Trump gets elected he had a quite a speech on on Saturday night in West Palm Beach [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=360.48s)]
*  where he talked about all the things he's going to do if they if you re-elect him. Is it your sense [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=365.92s)]
*  that that that we're safer or not? Well I do think we're safer in part because we have changed the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=370.56s)]
*  laws and it is just harder to get a state to send the wrong electors to Washington than it was prior [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=376.64s)]
*  to the change in law but I also think we have a president who recognizes that by elevating the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  stakes on the question of democracy he actually has a better chance of winning right? A lot of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  people thought that Biden made a mistake at the end of the midterms when he went and gave that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=392.0s)]
*  speech in Philadelphia on democracy being one of the key issues. Seems like we apparently do care [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=395.84s)]
*  about this. We do care about this and I think Joe Biden is going to continue to make the 2024 election [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=400.64s)]
*  about the future of American democracy's survival and in that way I think we're safer because Biden [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=406.8s)]
*  gets that putting the stakes in that way actually serves to make it a lot harder for the race to be [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=412.88s)]
*  close enough for there to be any credible question. You put forward two bills that talk about some [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=418.4s)]
*  very important social issues. I want to make sure we invite you back to have a good thorough [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=423.36s)]
*  discussion on both of those things because I think they will help solve our problems. Thank you sir. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=427.2s)]
*  Thanks Ali. Good to see you. You've probably heard of the political organization called [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  No Labels. It's one of those groups that vacuums up a lot of donor money by claiming to be bipartisan [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=436.4s)]
*  without offering any real solutions. One glance at the organization's scant platform reveals the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  same platitudes that voters have been hearing for years. Stuff like quote, America must strike a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=446.96s)]
*  balance between protecting women's rights to control their own reproductive health and our [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=452.08s)]
*  society's responsibility to protect human life and quote, Americans have a constitutional right [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  to own guns but society has a responsibility to keep dangerous weapons away from dangerous people [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=462.64s)]
*  end quote. It's fantastic stuff. Despite that less than inspiring message, No Labels has some pretty [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=468.24s)]
*  ambitious plans and wants to run a so-called centrist candidate for president and while No Labels [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=474.24s)]
*  may call itself bipartisan, it's pretty obvious to anyone paying attention that such a plan could [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=480.0s)]
*  help re-elect Donald Trump by siphoning moderate voters away from Joe Biden, the only candidate who [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=484.72s)]
*  has a substantial base of moderate voters. But don't take my word for it. Listen to one of the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=491.2s)]
*  group's former top advisors who quit this year over the plan to run a third-party candidate. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=496.08s)]
*  I do not believe that an independent bipartisan third-party ticket has any chance of success [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=503.28s)]
*  in 2024. I fear that despite its intentions to the contrary, if it proceeds it will end up [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=515.2s)]
*  it will end up helping Donald Trump. The Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah said effectively the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=524.96s)]
*  same thing telling the Hill unequivocally quote, the No Labels effort would elect Donald Trump. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=531.92s)]
*  Going on to say quote, I asked my chief strategist what would a candidate have to be like in order to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  draw voters from Donald Trump as opposed to drawing from Joe Biden. He said it would have to be someone [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  to the right of Donald Trump end quote. No Labels may claim to be unaffiliated with any party but [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=550.7199999999999s)]
*  and this is a big but. When you look at what the group wants to do, one is left with the impression [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=557.6s)]
*  that it is effectively operating as a Trojan horse to help elect Republicans, especially [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=563.12s)]
*  considering how steadfastly No Labels is refusing to reveal its donor list. Something that would [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=568.72s)]
*  give all of us a better insight into who exactly wants to see a spoiler candidate run next year. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=575.2800000000001s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hill, you recently pressed the group's founder [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=582.24s)]
*  on this matter. Listen to how that went. Why not reveal your donors? Because the truth is about [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  the time in which we live in, you reveal first of all we're not a party. You're registering as a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=594.4s)]
*  political party. But that's just language but we know how the game works in politics these days. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=600.32s)]
*  It's not that people really want to see the donors because there's nothing nefarious going on here, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  it's because they shouldn't trust that though. You know what they're going to have to see us [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=610.88s)]
*  through our work. Oh yeah. Now No Labels may not want to reveal its donors but Mother Jones got [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=614.64s)]
*  its hand on a partial list of them and while some have indeed donated to both parties as many ultra [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=621.12s)]
*  rich donors do, the report found quote generally these No Labels supporters appear to favor [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=627.68s)]
*  conservative candidates. We know the ultra conservative billionaire Harlan Crowe, the man [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=633.28s)]
*  who takes Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on all those expensive vacations, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSIOW7lh1Q&t=638.56s)]
