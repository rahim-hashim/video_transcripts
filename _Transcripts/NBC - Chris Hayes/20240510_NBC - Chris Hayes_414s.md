Video Description: Instead of poring over evidence or arguments related to his legal defense, today in the courtroom Donald Trump leafed through positive press clippings about himself. “Much like a child with an iPad at a restaurant, the ex-president needs to be entertained during the less-salacious portions of his trial,” says Chris Hayes.

# Trump reads positive press clippings about himself to bide time during trial
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and today marks day 15 of Donald Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=0.0s)]
*  It was obvious to everyone involved the ex-president who is not known for what you might call a strong attention span [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=5.88s)]
*  Is losing his patience [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  They don't like it when I talk during the day because they'd rather not have me talk at all [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=14.7s)]
*  so I'll now go and sit in a freezing cold courtroom for eight or nine hours and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=19.22s)]
*  Think about being on the campaign [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=25.02s)]
*  After complaining about the temperature the 77 year old ex-president sat down the defense table and began shuffling through a large stack of papers [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=27.939999999999998s)]
*  You might think he was poring over evidence or notes or arguments related to his legal defense [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=35.66s)]
*  But no, Donald Trump was leafing through positive press clippings about himself [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=39.68s)]
*  Much like a child with an iPad at a restaurant [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=44.82s)]
*  the ex-president needs to be entertained during the less salacious portions of his trial as [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=48.1s)]
*  Maggie Heberman in the New York Times puts it quote part of the reason the aides supply Trump with these articles during trials as they [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=52.62s)]
*  Did at his civil fraud trial last year as well is to keep him occupied during the proceedings [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=58.42s)]
*  That was president [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=63.46s)]
*  the whole country [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=64.98s)]
*  Now as we've covered on this show before those articles come courtesy of one of Trump's aides [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=66.9s)]
*  Who his staff have nicknamed the human printer? I'm not making any of this up [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=71.7s)]
*  Okay quote because she travels around with a portable printer so that she can quickly produce mood boosting articles for Trump to read [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=75.98s)]
*  She has also been spotted running after Trump's golf court [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=84.42s)]
*  Cart on the golf course so that he can read things presumably positive press between holes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=88.42s)]
*  Donald Trump's need to be mollified [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=95.1s)]
*  Validated apparently even extends to his actual legal defense [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=98.18s)]
*  so today the ex-presidents attorneys displayed this January 2017 New York Times front page as [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=101.06s)]
*  Evidence with its rather critical headline quote tax plan sows confusion as border tension sore [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=108.14s)]
*  Strange thing to introduce in evidence according to reports Trump is enamored [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=114.58000000000001s)]
*  With how he looks in the attached picture [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=120.18s)]
*  Which I find sort of adorable and his former aide testified today that he sent a copy of the photo to multiple people like [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=122.22000000000001s)]
*  Don't look good. Is that a good picture of me? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=128.72s)]
*  Now Trump's need for additional distractions may have stemmed from the somewhat more technical nature of today's testimony [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=131.9s)]
*  Compared to the past two sessions with bombshell testimony from Stormy Daniels today was a little on the drier side [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=138.22s)]
*  NBC News referring to it as quote the metaphorical eye of the storm [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=144.3s)]
*  Caught between yesterday's testimony from Daniels and Monday's expected testimony from [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=148.22s)]
*  Former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. We're having much more on him a bit later in the show [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  Much of today's proceedings was so run-of-the-mill that many reporters spent part of the day on a rather particular [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=158.66s)]
*  Fixation was something stuck in Donald Trump's hair [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=163.82s)]
*  Our eyewitnesses in the courtroom noticed what looked like a piece of ribbon [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=166.98s)]
*  Affixed to the back of his head what it's worth Maggie Heyman reported. It was a particularly dark spindle of hairspray [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=171.06s)]
*  As for today's substance we heard from a number of prosecution witnesses about the relevance of potential evidence including [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=178.1s)]
*  representatives from AT&T and Verizon about phone records multiple paralegals from Manhattan District Attorney's Office about social media posts and phone data because for as much as [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=184.06s)]
*  Donald Trump whines about this process and how long it's taking and how unfair the gag order is and how he should be on the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=192.22s)]
*  Campaign trail he is part of the reason why the trial is taking as long as it is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  Because his lawyers have taken this strange and rare step of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=203.32s)]
*  refusing to stipulate as it's called to the evidence being presented by the prosecution as [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=207.55999999999997s)]
*  The Washington Post explained last month quote in many court proceedings opposing lawyers stipulate to basic facts to avoid [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=212.55999999999997s)]
*  Wasting time on minor details that aren't really disputed on Trump's legal team a decision was made to stipulate to nothing and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=219.82s)]
*  Fight over everything but because of course Trump's tactic of choice has always been to delay things as much as possible [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=227.12s)]
*  So he can return to the White House and immediately make his legal woes disappear [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=233.88s)]
*  Joining me now are two people who watch this unfold at the courthouse today Suzanne Craig an investigative reporter in New York Times [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=238.68s)]
*  Who's been covering the trial as well as Robert F. Kennedy's brain worms and Christy Greenberg served as a federal prosecutor for the Southern District [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=243.92s)]
*  It's one of the best scoops I've read recently, okay, so can we start on this you're a lawyer and I want to start on this weird process thing because that dominated much of today [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=251.56s)]
*  You've got this sort of we've seen this before essentially custodial testimony, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=258.32s)]
*  This record is what it purports to be and I can tell you that because I'm the paralegal who did it or I'm the person who transcribed it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=263.0s)]
*  Right. Why is this necessary again? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=270.0s)]
*  Okay, so [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  You have to be able to do this because you have to be able to do this because you have to be able to do this because you have to be able to do this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=274.32s)]
*  You have to be able to show kind of that there is a basis to have these this evidence be admitted and usually that's a thing where again if it's something like phone records [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=280.32s)]
*  There's usually not really a dispute that this phone called this number at this time and this is how long the call lasted for these are usually like pretty basic facts that everybody can agree to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=290.32s)]
*  But they are not stipulating to those right the parties can't agree [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=301.32s)]
*  So they have to bring in an evidence a witness somebody from Verizon some from AT&T to just walk through what those mean now there I think are probably two reasons why the defense is doing this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=305.32s)]
*  I want to hear them because I'm confused as to why no honestly. Yeah, so one reason is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=316.32s)]
*  Yeah, the jury is bored right there. They're bored with this. This is not, you know, the most scintillate [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=321.32s)]
*  This is a letdown from Stormy Daniels fireworks from yesterday, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=328.32s)]
*  They're bored and so they're sitting there and they're listening to all of this and you know, who do they blame for it? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=332.32s)]
*  Who's the one putting on these witnesses the prosecutors? So right. These are prosecutions witnesses [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=337.32s)]
*  Yeah, and they have to because the defense is making them right. But the jury doesn't know that the defense is the jury doesn't know what a stipulation is like the jury doesn't know that in usual cases [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=343.32s)]
*  These kinds of things aren't put on as evidence. So they're like, ah, the prosecution they're kind of lumbering in their case. That's one two [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=352.32s)]
*  It actually seems like the defense attorneys were really questioning the witnesses like they weren't necessarily agreeing everything was what it would said like well couldn't this just you know this call couldn't it just be a pocket dial? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=359.32s)]
*  They're trying to raise actual doubts about it. Yes. Like, oh, there's this says this says a minute but really that could be 15 seconds and it's rounded up to a minute and that's how it works. Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=370.32s)]
*  Like they're trying to like, oh, when you have this call number calling this call number, but you don't know who's behind each of these calls. Okay, there's actual substantive doubt. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=381.32s)]
*  So correct. So they were doing two things I think at the same time. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=389.32s)]
*  You [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIWrrU9mnao&t=411.32s)]
