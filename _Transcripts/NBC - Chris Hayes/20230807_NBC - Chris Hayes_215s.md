# Indicted ex-president celebrates America’s World Cup defeat in ‘deranged’ rant
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k)
*  For those of you who are soccer fans, it was a heartbreaking weekend as the US women's soccer team was defeated at the World Cup in Australia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=0.0s)]
*  Two-time World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe was one of three US players to miss their penalty kicks against Sweden. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=8.0s)]
*  It was her final World Cup match, and with that the US team, the reigning champions, were eliminated. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=15.0s)]
*  But what was frankly shocking was to see people who claimed to be patriots and lovers of America, nationalists even, just openly trashing an American national team. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=22.0s)]
*  Look at these reactions from the MAGA folks. I'm glad they lost. What an embarrassment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=31.0s)]
*  Even outright rooting for the opposing foreign team, Sweden. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=36.0s)]
*  Because they say this women's team, this American women's team, is too woke that Megan takes a knee during the anthem. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=40.0s)]
*  I mean, grow up, guys. Stop being such snowflakes and learn to love your country and your fellow Americans. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=47.0s)]
*  Still, the most deranged response of all to this World Cup defeat came from who else? Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=53.0s)]
*  The ex-president, who has been indicted three times and faces another possible indictment, took time in between court dates to attack the women's team, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=59.0s)]
*  claiming many of our players were openly hostile to America, singling out Rapinoe with, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=67.0s)]
*  Nice shot, Megan. The USA is going to hell. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=72.0s)]
*  This was part of a weekend of completely unhinged social media posts that included attacks on former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and her husband, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=75.0s)]
*  who are also apparently going to hell. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=83.0s)]
*  But let's be clear, this has nothing to do with wokeness or anything else like that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=86.0s)]
*  It has to do with his petty grievances and the fact that Trump is a man who holds on to grudges, especially against women. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=89.0s)]
*  He gives it away in singling out Rapinoe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=96.0s)]
*  Back in 2019, when Trump was in the White House and the women's team was making a run at a second consecutive World Cup title, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=98.0s)]
*  she was asked about a potential White House visit during a photo shoot. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=105.0s)]
*  Are you excited about going to the White House? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=109.0s)]
*  I'm not going to the f***ing White House. No, I'm not going to the White House. We're not going to be invited. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=113.0s)]
*  You're not going to be invited? I doubt it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=119.0s)]
*  Trump, who was president at the time and presumably had more important things to do, shot back at her writing, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=121.0s)]
*  quote, Megan should win first before she talks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=127.0s)]
*  Well, 11 days later, that is exactly what she and the women's team did, becoming World Cup winners and skipping the White House visit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=130.0s)]
*  So it's not about woke-ness. It's about Trump's thin skin, which is why he went after the US women's soccer team this weekend. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=138.0s)]
*  He wrote that the loss is fully emblematic of what is happening to our once great nation under crooked Joe Biden and woke equals failure. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=145.0s)]
*  But that makes no sense because nine of the 23 players, basically 40 percent of the roster, were on the World Cup winning 2019 squad. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=153.0s)]
*  And five of those women were also on the 2015 winning team, including Megan Rapinoe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=160.0s)]
*  When I look at the ex-president and then I look at the US women's national soccer team, I see two major differences. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=165.0s)]
*  First, this women's team won the World Cup twice. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=172.0s)]
*  Donald Trump couldn't win the presidency twice. He barely won it once. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=176.0s)]
*  And second, this team, particularly Rapinoe, can handle loss with dignity and grace. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=180.0s)]
*  They can accept and own their defeat, something Donald Trump continues to remain incapable of doing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=186.0s)]
*  You [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CjaaQbE8k&t=195.0s)]
