Video Description: “I can't help but ask: Is this one of the stupidest, most pointless crimes ever committed?

# Hayes: Trump advisor Navarro committed one of 'stupidest, most pointless crimes'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. One of the men behind Donald Trump's attempted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=0.0s)]
*  coup is facing justice tonight. Serious repercussions. Former Trump White House [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=4.0s)]
*  adviser Peter Navarro has been found guilty on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress by a jury [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=9.36s)]
*  of his peers. Navarro was subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee back in February of last year, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=15.68s)]
*  like hundreds of others. Committee investigators were seeking testimony and documents related to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=21.52s)]
*  his involvement in Trump's attempted coup, specifically charges that Navarro, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=26.08s)]
*  reportedly worked with Steve Bannon and others to develop and implement a plan to delay Congress's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=31.04s)]
*  certification of and ultimately change the outcome of the 2020 election. And just to be clear here, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  it's not like Navarro was hiding his involvement in the coup. He self-published this document full [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=44.08s)]
*  of bogus claims of election fraud that he called the Navarro Report, in case anyone wanted to know [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=49.04s)]
*  who wrote it. He wrote about the coup in his book, including his signature political strategy to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=54.16s)]
*  overturn the election, which he called the Green Bay Sweep, reference to an old football play. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=59.68s)]
*  Navarro went on the record with the Daily Beast to talk about his role in the coup. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=64.88s)]
*  And he appeared on this very network multiple times to discuss the coup with Ari Melber. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=69.2s)]
*  We had over 100 congressmen and senators on Capitol ready to implement the sweep. The sweep [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=76.72s)]
*  was simply that. We were going to challenge the results of the election in the six battleground [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=83.6s)]
*  states. The votes were sent back to those battleground states and looked at again that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=90.16s)]
*  there would be enough concern amongst the legislatures that most or all of those states [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=97.52s)]
*  would decertify the election. Do you realize you are describing a coup? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Ari Melber, President of the United States of America [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=108.88s)]
*  No, I totally reject many of your premises there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Peter Navarro, President of the United States of America [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=113.92s)]
*  Ari, it's like a naked bootleg, but for ending the American experiment. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=114.72s)]
*  So it's not like Peter Navarro wasn't willing to talk about the coup. He just wouldn't talk about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=118.8s)]
*  it with one group of people, the January 6th committee, even though, as former committee chair [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=124.0s)]
*  Liz Cheney pointed out, plenty of other Trump allies defied their work while still complying [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=128.16s)]
*  with a lawful subpoena. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=134.72s)]
*  Ari Melber, President of the United States of America [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=136.0s)]
*  Roger Stone took the fifth. General Michael Flynn took the fifth. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=137.2s)]
*  John Eastman took the fifth. Others like Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=141.2s)]
*  simply refused to comply with lawful subpoenas and they have been indicted. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=146.16s)]
*  Peter Navarro, President of the United States of America [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=150.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon was also convicted of contempt of Congress last year for doing the same thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=150.56s)]
*  I really can't help but ask, is this one of the stupidest, most pointless crimes ever committed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  by anyone? Even if Navarro wanted to obstruct the investigation, he could have just hired a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=160.88s)]
*  lawyer for the week, pleaded the fifth at every question, he'd be well within his constitutional [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=165.92s)]
*  rights to do so, others did it, and now he wouldn't be facing prison time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=170.16s)]
*  Because even as Navarro pledged to appeal, this was obviously such an open and shut case. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=174.96s)]
*  The trial only lasted about two days, the jury only deliberated for a few hours. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=180.0s)]
*  Probably a few hours too long, actually. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=184.96s)]
*  And when NBC asked Navarro's lawyer why he did not call any witnesses to defend his client, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=187.6s)]
*  he replied, and I quote him here, what defense do I have? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=192.48s)]
*  you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgL3UKMSCgw&t=216.72s)]
