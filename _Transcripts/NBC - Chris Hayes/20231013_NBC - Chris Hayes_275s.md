# ‘Calm before the storm’: Israel-Lebanon border braces for crisis to expand north
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84)
*  NBC News foreign correspondent Josh Letterman joins us now from the northern coast of Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=0.0s)]
*  in the city of Nahariya. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=6.2s)]
*  Josh, what are you hearing today as the mobilization seems to be nearing the beginning of some [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=8.22s)]
*  kind of ground offensive? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=15.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Chris. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  We're about three hours past that 24-hour deadline that you just described for those [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=20.48s)]
*  1.1 million people in the northern Gaza Strip to get to the south. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=25.6s)]
*  I think a lot of people both in Israel and in the Gaza Strip are really bracing for a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=29.48s)]
*  major ground incursion to potentially start when the clock struck midnight here in Israel [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=33.64s)]
*  and in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=39.92s)]
*  So far, we haven't seen any signs that that major ground incursion has yet begun. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=41.4s)]
*  But we did hear from Israel's military that for the very first time that we know about [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=46.84s)]
*  since the terror attacks of Saturday, Israeli ground troops conducted raids into the Gaza [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Strip, where they went into Gaza to not only try to wipe out Hamas terrorists and seize [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  weapons but also, according to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, to search for evidence [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=65.56s)]
*  that could help them ultimately free the hostages that are located there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=71.36s)]
*  As far as we know, they didn't manage to get any hostages out during this one incursion, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=75.92s)]
*  It does seem to suggest that Israel is building up very quickly towards a much larger offensive [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=81.64s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip as the humanitarian situation, as you described, is really just getting worse [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=88.76s)]
*  and worse. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=94.2s)]
*  In fact, we learned that as those civilians are trying to evacuate to the south, some 70 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=94.76s)]
*  or so of them were killed today in three convoys that were heading south by Israeli airstrikes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=101.88s)]
*  That's according not only to Palestinian health officials but also to local witnesses that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=107.56s)]
*  NBC News was able to speak to within the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  And there are real concerns tonight within Israel that this crisis could soon start to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=117.0s)]
*  expand beyond the Gaza Strip to the other fronts that Israel has to deal with, most [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=122.04s)]
*  notably up where I am in northern Israel along the border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah made [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  clear today that they do not plan to sit this out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=134.44s)]
*  They have been fairly restrained compared to what we've seen many times in the past. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=137.4s)]
*  There have been some skirmishes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military over the last couple [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=142.52s)]
*  of days, but the leader is making clear that at some point they do plan to get involved. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=146.44s)]
*  And that has people in the community where I'm at, Nahariya and other areas along this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=151.0s)]
*  border, very concerned, anxious, walking the streets, feeling like this is the calm before [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=155.4s)]
*  the storm, and they are worried that just like rockets have been falling daily into [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=161.64s)]
*  southern Israel near the Gaza Strip, that they will also be facing that kind of rocket [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=166.44s)]
*  attacks here in northern Israel, Chris. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  Josh, yes, I mean, I want to just follow up on that because I saw some reports today about [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  exchanges of fire. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  There was a Reuters cameraman who was killed in southern Lebanon where he was covering [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  this earlier today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=184.92s)]
*  Is there, are the Hezbollah rockets more advanced, less advanced, or about the same as what Hamas [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=187.56s)]
*  has been firing from Gaza and does Iron Dome, which is the sort of infamous system that has [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=193.24s)]
*  been able to shoot those rockets down, rather effectively function as well in the north? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=198.12s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  So one thing to remember is that both Hamas and Hezbollah get a lot of support from Iran, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  a country that has a very advanced missile system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  And so in both of these countries, it's not simply pedestrians who are making their own [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=215.72s)]
*  rockets out of whatever they can find. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=221.32s)]
*  They have training, they have support, they have supplies being brought in. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=222.76s)]
*  That having been said, Hezbollah is known to have longer-term rockets. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=226.12s)]
*  And in fact, the air defense system here in the north, it's a layered air defense system, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=229.72s)]
*  but they have a special program in place really to address rockets that are of the longer [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=234.36s)]
*  range, somewhere in the 60 to 100-mile range. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=239.8s)]
*  And so they really are acutely aware of that threat from those longer-range rockets that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=244.6s)]
*  could reach deeper into Israel because of the capabilities that Hezbollah has amassed over the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=250.12s)]
*  years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=254.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1mypDDy-84&t=269.72s)]
