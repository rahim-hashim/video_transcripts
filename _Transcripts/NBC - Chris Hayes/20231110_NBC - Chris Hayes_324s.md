# MAGA Mike Johnson believes ‘Bible comes first over the Constitution,’ says Raskin
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees)
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat in Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=0.0s)]
*  He served on the January 6th committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=2.12s)]
*  He's now the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=3.72s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=6.32s)]
*  Did I get anything wrong there about the way this math works? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=8.52s)]
*  No, I think you got it all right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=14.56s)]
*  My only caveat here is I don't know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=16.04s)]
*  that the conflict within the GOP is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=18.72s)]
*  between those who want to spend more [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=21.72s)]
*  and those who want to spend less. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=23.68s)]
*  As we saw during the Trump administration, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=24.96s)]
*  they don't really care about debts and deficits. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=26.76s)]
*  That all goes out the window. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=28.84s)]
*  What's really happening here is you have a kleptocrat, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=30.88s)]
*  Donald Trump, who runs the GOP, and he's in it [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=35.08s)]
*  as family business. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=39.12s)]
*  He is a guy who does take $1 for his salary annually [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=40.16s)]
*  when he's president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=45.64s)]
*  Because he's collecting tens of millions of dollars [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=46.14s)]
*  from the autocrats of the world, Saudi Arabia, United [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Egypt, you name it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  But how does a person like that form a working majority [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=54.96s)]
*  within the GOP? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=58.44s)]
*  The kleptocrats have to reach out to the theocrats. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=59.8s)]
*  And that's where Mike Johnson and the right wing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  white Christian nationalists come into it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=66.12s)]
*  And the problem is that those people really [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=68.44s)]
*  want to legislate anti-abortion, like Mike Johnson, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=71.36s)]
*  whose position is no abortions in the country at all, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=75.16s)]
*  with no exceptions for rape or incest. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=78.24s)]
*  And they start attaching, like graffiti, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=80.8s)]
*  all of these anti-abortion amendments, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=83.72s)]
*  all these homophobic anti-gay amendments, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=85.52s)]
*  anti-diversity equity inclusion. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=89.0s)]
*  And there are about a dozen Republicans [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=91.0s)]
*  left who are in non-completely gerrymandered districts. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  In other words, they're not in districts [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=97.56s)]
*  that have been drawn bright red in the image of Donald Trump [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=99.96s)]
*  and MAGA. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  And so those people don't want to be [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=105.28s)]
*  voting to ban abortion in the District of Columbia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=107.44s)]
*  They don't want to be bashing gay people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=111.32s)]
*  And they certainly don't want to be legislating against choice [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=113.76s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=116.4s)]
*  And that's the fix that they're in. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=117.36s)]
*  Those people's political future depends [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=119.0s)]
*  on moving away from MAGA. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  But MAGA will only give their votes if they get that stuff. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  OK, so that's super illuminating. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  There's all these sort of poison pill culture war amendments [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=127.72s)]
*  they want to attach. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=130.68s)]
*  And there's some group of the caucus [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=131.76s)]
*  that just can't vote for them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=133.28s)]
*  Well, my understanding, too, is that basically those top line [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=134.6s)]
*  numbers for all the funding this year that was worked out [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  in that debt ceiling deal between McCarthy and Biden [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=139.28s)]
*  and then the Senate, those are the numbers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=143.04s)]
*  The numbers are working off in the Senate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=145.6s)]
*  But there's a faction of the House [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  that will think those numbers are too big and wants to cut. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=148.88s)]
*  And if they do that, the appropriators [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=152.04s)]
*  don't want to cut that much. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=154.36s)]
*  And so they're irreconcilable. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=155.6s)]
*  Well, that's true, too. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=160.04s)]
*  There's a faction of the Freedom Caucus, the Chipp Roy [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=161.04s)]
*  people, who will not vote for those numbers [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=164.16s)]
*  if it's a Democratic administration. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=166.6s)]
*  If it's Trumpy, of course they'll vote for those numbers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=168.28s)]
*  And much more inflated than that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=173.0s)]
*  But that's true. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=175.28s)]
*  In other words, they want to show that somehow they're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=176.8s)]
*  slashing into the social budget. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=179.08s)]
*  They want to cut SNAP benefits. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=181.68s)]
*  They want to dismantle anything the government does that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=186.0s)]
*  doesn't directly benefit Donald Trump [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  and that doesn't directly benefit them [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  and the corporations that they serve. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=194.08s)]
*  So that's a problem, too. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=196.28000000000003s)]
*  What we've got is a rule or ruin mentality. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=197.44000000000003s)]
*  Either Trump is going to be in and he's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=200.84s)]
*  going to rule all the way to the point of dictating [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=202.4s)]
*  who gets prosecuted and who doesn't. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=205.04s)]
*  And we already saw with Roger Stone sentencing, for example, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=207.12s)]
*  how micro he wants to get in terms [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=211.08s)]
*  of telling the Department of Justice what to do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=213.24s)]
*  Or if they can't rule, they're just going to ruin everything. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=215.68s)]
*  They'll shut the government down. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=218.6s)]
*  They'll impeach Joe Biden for absolutely nothing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=220.08s)]
*  They'll just be a wrecking ball against Democratic purposes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't think the main story here [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=227.36s)]
*  is sort of the personalities at issue or their experience. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=229.44s)]
*  I don't think the most gifted legislator in the world, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, for example, if she [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=234.72s)]
*  was trying to sort of whip this caucus, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=236.68s)]
*  would have that much success. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=238.28s)]
*  But I also do think that one of the things I've learned [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=239.24s)]
*  in my life is like, you know, there's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=242.36s)]
*  certain technique and expertise that comes with any craft, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  whether you're building cabinets or you're teaching kids, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  you're working as a crossing guard, you're serving food. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=250.56s)]
*  And that sure as heck is true for like trying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=253.56s)]
*  to get a caucus together, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  It just seems like of all the people to try to do this, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  you know, you've served in Congress. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=261.35999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't, he's starting from zero on the task at hand. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=263.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, there are complicated rules [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=269.96s)]
*  and traditions and relationships that actually govern [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=271.84s)]
*  the real legislative process. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=274.76s)]
*  But someone like Mike Johnson says, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  the Bible comes first over the Constitution, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=279.12s)]
*  then the Constitution, and then the laws and the rules [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  and the regulations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=284.96s)]
*  And by the time you get down there, it's too late. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=285.72s)]
*  I mean, you know, they're sending us something. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=287.88s)]
*  I don't even know what it is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=290.96s)]
*  A few days before the government is about to shut down, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=292.44s)]
*  they don't have respect for the actual legislative process. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=296.24s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, thank you so much for your time, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=300.68s)]
*  sir. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=303.08s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlSidVWCees&t=303.2s)]
