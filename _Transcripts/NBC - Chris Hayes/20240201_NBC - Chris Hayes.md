# All In with Chris Hayes - Feb. 1  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=0.0s)]
*  He's used 50 million dollars of his campaign funds on legal fees. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=3.52s)]
*  Donald Trump takes the money and runs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Trump was pushing them to do that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=14.08s)]
*  He wanted to be named the presumptive nominee. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=15.52s)]
*  Tonight, how Trump has effectively destroyed his own political party, up and down the ticket. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=18.12s)]
*  Then. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=23.48s)]
*  This is a dangerous moment in the Middle East. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=24.64s)]
*  The latest on a possible U.S. military response as a Republican frontrunner avoids the issue. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=27.16s)]
*  If you were in the White House today, would you strike a lawn directly? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=33.6s)]
*  It wouldn't have happened if I were in the White House. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=36.6s)]
*  Plus Republican infighting over border security and tax cuts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=39.4s)]
*  Which one will win out? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=43.08s)]
*  Get your taxes down. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=45.32s)]
*  And the podcaster from Texas under pressure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=50.6s)]
*  I'm right now, as you know, in a very tough reelection race in Texas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=54.72s)]
*  One of the Democrats seeking to topple Ted Cruz joins me when All In starts right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=59.56s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=69.48s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=70.4s)]
*  Well, we got some news today that confirms something that we kind of knew already, which is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=71.08s)]
*  the Republican Party doesn't really exist anymore as an institution. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=74.72s)]
*  It has essentially been cannibalized by Donald Trump, subsumed into MAGA, with profound implications [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=79.4s)]
*  both for Republicans and for the American democratic system as a whole. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=86.36s)]
*  You can see the evidence of this everywhere you look, like a new revelation that the Republican [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=90.84s)]
*  National Committee's anemic fundraising has left it with a paltry $8 million on hand. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=95.84s)]
*  Not exactly the war chest a major political party needs in an election year, especially [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=102.2s)]
*  considering Democrats have nearly three times as much in their coffers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=106.36s)]
*  Speaking to Puck, one RNC member offered this blunt assessment, quote, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=110.16s)]
*  Puck also reports Trump world is rather unhappy with the state of affairs at the RNC and they [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=119.88s)]
*  are looking to install a MAGA loyalist at the top. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=124.4s)]
*  Something Steve Bannon openly advocated for earlier this week when he called for the ouster [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=127.36s)]
*  of party chair, Ronna Romney McDaniel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=132.04s)]
*  Why is Ronna McDaniel and that team over there, they don't want to do it because they understand [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=136.2s)]
*  they're culpable. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  What in the hell was the RNC doing? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=141.44s)]
*  They're guilty of a mortal sin against this Republic and that sin is not going to go away [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=145.56s)]
*  until she is removed as the chairman of the RNC. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=151.88s)]
*  I'm tired of the happy talk and we're going to you know why she's got to take out a line [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=166.04s)]
*  of credit because you cut her off, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=169.56s)]
*  The war room, I said not another penny, not another 25 bucks or 50 bucks a month, not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=173.56s)]
*  one cent until they're gone. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=179.6s)]
*  OK, now let's just be clear here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=182.6s)]
*  The idea that Steve Bannon, two shirt is strategic genius, is solely responsible for the pitiful [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=184.56s)]
*  fundraising the committee is laughable. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=189.88s)]
*  That's not it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=191.88s)]
*  But it does remain true the MAGA movement has had it with the RNC, which is ironic for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=193.24s)]
*  a number of reasons. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=197.12s)]
*  First of all, because RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel is so unabashedly pro MAGA, she tried [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=198.12s)]
*  to pressure Nikki Haley, Trump's only credible remaining opponent in the Republican primary, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=203.76s)]
*  to drop out, only for Trump to then stab McDaniel in the back so he could play benevolent dictator [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=207.68s)]
*  and say that Haley should stay in the race. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  It's also ironic because Trump, of all people, is partially responsible for the RNC's financial [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=215.72s)]
*  Because his super PACs are hoovering up all of the small dollar donations so he can use [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=221.56s)]
*  them to pay his tens of millions of dollars in legal bills. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=227.4s)]
*  And to be clear, it is always the case to some extent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=232.08s)]
*  The presidential candidate and their movement controls the purse strings of their respective [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=234.4s)]
*  parties during the election year. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=237.72s)]
*  But Trump is just on another level as he subsumes the Republican Party into his own party of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=239.4s)]
*  one. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=244.76s)]
*  And you can see the trickle down effects of this all over the country as the Republican [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=245.76s)]
*  Party as a party destroys itself like a snake eating its own tail. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=249.0s)]
*  A lot of the problems that becomes Trump himself is a conspiracy obsessed maniac who cultivates [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=252.84s)]
*  the most deranged characteristics in his diehard policies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=259.28s)]
*  In Michigan, the state Republican Party voted to fire its head, Christina Caramo, earlier [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=264.12s)]
*  this month and replace her with Pete Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman and Trump [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=269.04s)]
*  ambassador to the Netherlands. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=273.6s)]
*  If you're a regular watcher of this program, you might remember Caramo. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=275.6s)]
*  She's the election denying conspiracy theorist who ran to be Michigan's secretary of state [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=278.88s)]
*  in 2022. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=283.0s)]
*  Having intimate relationships with people who are demonically possessed or oppressed, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=285.56s)]
*  I strongly believe that a person opens themselves up to possession. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=289.8s)]
*  Demonic possession is real. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=293.6s)]
*  How people become possessed, I don't know all the details of it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=295.76s)]
*  But I was surmised that the sexual licentiousness in our culture, it's a lot of spiritual things [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=298.8s)]
*  that go wrong. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=305.0s)]
*  So she didn't win that race in 2022, thankfully, and you can see why Michigan Republicans have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=307.28s)]
*  decided they don't want Caramo running the show anymore. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=311.84s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=314.8s)]
*  She's refusing to step down and it's now splitting its party in half. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=315.8s)]
*  In fact, the RNC held a big meeting today with representatives from across the nation [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=319.76s)]
*  and Michigan Republicans did not have a seat at the table because Caramo refuses to step [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=324.12s)]
*  down and hand the reins to Hoekstra. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=328.88s)]
*  In fact, both of them showed up today, each claiming they are in charge of the Michigan [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=331.6s)]
*  Republican Party and neither one was officially recognized by the RNC. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=335.92s)]
*  Now, factional weirdness happens in politics all the time, these kind of party fights. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  So if this was a one-off, you could say, ah, yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  But it's not just Michigan. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=346.88s)]
*  This is like, this is a trend, okay? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  In Arizona, you've got the failed MAGA gubernatorial candidate, Kerry Lake, who is now involved [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=350.04s)]
*  in a convoluted feud that has pushed out that state's Republican chairman, Jeff DeWitt. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=355.86s)]
*  Now, depending on who you ask, DeWitt either tried to bribe Lake to stay out of the upcoming [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  Senate race or he was the victim of an elaborate scheme from Lake to oust him from his position [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=364.84s)]
*  so that she can claim total control of the state party. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=370.28s)]
*  Now, there's a new head of the Arizona Republican Party, a so-called election integrity activist [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=373.08s)]
*  who worked on Trump's 2020 campaign. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=379.08s)]
*  Although her election to party chair wasn't all smooth sailing, as the New York Times [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=382.12s)]
*  reports, get this, quote, the vote was delayed by a lengthy debate over a motion to ban [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=385.92s)]
*  the use of electronic tabulators, mistrusted by many election deniers in the party to count [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  the ballots. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=397.44s)]
*  But we're not done. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=398.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Nevada, where the Republican Party is run by a guy who was literally criminally [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=400.48s)]
*  indicted for his role in Trump's fake elector scheme, the state is holding both a Republican [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=405.04s)]
*  primary and a caucus next week. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=409.56s)]
*  Because of some complicated infighting, Nikki Haley would be on the primary ballot while [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=412.58s)]
*  Donald Trump would be competing in the caucus. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=417.46s)]
*  Now, the caucus is the one actually awarding delegates, which means the whole contest is [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=419.06s)]
*  basically rigged in his favor, which is the whole point of them concocting this entire [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=424.06s)]
*  enterprise. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=429.18s)]
*  Also, another irony, of course, because if the situation was reversed, Trump would be [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=430.18s)]
*  railing to anyone and everyone about how the contest is being stolen from him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=434.86s)]
*  And this is what you got to understand. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=439.14000000000004s)]
*  When he calls things rigged, that is an aspiration. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=440.62s)]
*  It's not moral condemnation. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  He wants things to be rigged in his favor. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=446.86s)]
*  That is his model. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  He thinks everything is rigged and should be rigged in his favor. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure, to be fair, he would win a fully fair, unrigged Republican primary. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=453.5s)]
*  That said, it's hard to disentangle the current mess the party finds itself in from Trump [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=459.06s)]
*  and his movement's obvious power grab. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=462.86s)]
*  The complete control the MAGA movement has over the entirety of the party apparatus. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=465.62s)]
*  And again, this isn't just some like backroom politics of the RNC and the Republican Party. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=471.54s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's vision for the entire country to bend the fabric of reality and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  the American experiment and its political system to his whims. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=485.06s)]
*  The current broken state of the Republican Party, you see, which is now run by cranks [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=489.2s)]
*  whose only qualification is their filthy to him, is his vision for the whole U.S. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=494.1s)]
*  government. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=499.18s)]
*  Just Macintosh's Democratic strategist who served as a senior advisor to the 2016 Hillary [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=501.58000000000004s)]
*  campaign, Sarah Longwell, was the publisher for the Bullwork, host of the Focus Group [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=506.02000000000004s)]
*  podcast, and they join me now. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  Certainly start with you as someone who's been in and around Republican politics for [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=512.22s)]
*  a long time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=515.14s)]
*  I mean, from time to time, you'll see like weird party fights crop up. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=516.14s)]
*  It's not, you know, and those happen in Democratic parties sometimes, but like the sort of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=519.98s)]
*  full spectrum nuttiness and fighting from state to date again in states that are going [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=524.02s)]
*  to be really crucial for the election. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=529.38s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=531.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, here's what's crazy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=535.42s)]
*  Back before Donald Trump took everything over, he was the crank. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=537.34s)]
*  He was like the head crank in charge and he was surrounded by lots of other cranks. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=541.42s)]
*  But the voters wanted him and normal Republicans sort of eschewed him and wanted to walk away [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=546.06s)]
*  from him. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=551.86s)]
*  But what has happened over the last seven years is the total inverse of that, the reverse [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=552.62s)]
*  of it. So right now, Donald Trump now is surrounded by people like Suzy Wiles and Chris [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=557.46s)]
*  LaSavita and has real people around him. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=562.98s)]
*  But he has stacked the rest of the party with lunatics and cranks whose only qualification, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=565.7800000000001s)]
*  you just said this, but this was this was sort of my point, too, is the reason that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=572.1s)]
*  there's been this brain drain is because the litmus task or the qualifications necessary [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=576.5400000000001s)]
*  now to be in the party apparatus is only are you the most maga? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=580.74s)]
*  Are you the most loyal to Trump? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=585.14s)]
*  And people who are willing to be like in the Kerry Lake sort of vein of total [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=587.1s)]
*  sycophant to Trump, those are the people who are rising to the top. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=592.78s)]
*  But they don't they don't have any real skills. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=595.42s)]
*  You know, they're not capable of running state parties that are capable of making things [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=597.7s)]
*  happen. And so weirdly now, Trump controls the money. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=601.74s)]
*  He controls the center of gravity and he's populated by sort of this pygmy colony of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=605.46s)]
*  weirdos who do nothing but support him. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=610.26s)]
*  There's also this rigged charge. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=613.26s)]
*  I mean, you know, you're a veteran of that 2016 contest, a primary Democratic party, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=614.78s)]
*  which which was which was very bitterly contested in many ways and lots of sort of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=618.34s)]
*  frustration about like, was the DNC being a neutral arbiter? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  There's nothing like they have had two contests and there was a move of Ronald [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=626.58s)]
*  McDaniel getting on air to be like, you need to drop out. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=634.22s)]
*  There was a move for a resolution like not even pretending any neutrality. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=636.54s)]
*  And of course, again, this is the vision that he has for all politics, like that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=640.66s)]
*  Yes, I win heads. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=644.94s)]
*  I win. Tales you lose. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=646.1s)]
*  Absolutely. You can see how he has reshaped just about every aspect of the electoral [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=647.14s)]
*  system. The voters are different now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=653.26s)]
*  The the local officials are different now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=656.18s)]
*  The candidates are different now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=658.62s)]
*  But almost nowhere is it more stark than in the party apparatus itself. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=660.14s)]
*  And it's for the exact point that you and Sarah have both made. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=663.82s)]
*  If you make your litmus test absolute fealty to an unhinged racist weirdo, guess what [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=666.82s)]
*  kind of people you get. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=672.78s)]
*  That's what's stacked top to bottom now. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=674.86s)]
*  And at some point, usually chafe when we're like Donald Trump is so new and different [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=676.58s)]
*  and he's totally remade the Republican Party. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's like, now you can trace this back to Newt Gingrich and Lee Atwater and sowing [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=682.78s)]
*  the seeds that would eventually get you the kind of racist, unhinged autocrat that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=686.98s)]
*  Donald Trump is. I think where the Republicans didn't necessarily lay the groundwork for [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=692.7s)]
*  it is in such a grifter. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=697.38s)]
*  I don't think they ever expected that somebody like that was going to come in and then [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=699.3000000000001s)]
*  scoop up all of their small dollars for his own legal fees to pay his own. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=702.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, well, that's the thing about the money, right? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=705.7800000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, one of the things Sarah long Sarah is that the parties have gotten weaker [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=708.22s)]
*  over time. Partly that's because they can only raise as hard as money. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=714.0200000000001s)]
*  And so the combination of McCain fine gold plus Citizens United means the super PACs [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=717.34s)]
*  can raise unlimited amounts of money. You've got this whole different structure. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=721.86s)]
*  The parties, both parties have less financial relevance. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=724.94s)]
*  But it's also like there is one to one displacement happening here. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=729.1800000000001s)]
*  I think the RNC raised, if I'm not mistaken, like 80 million dollars last year. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=731.98s)]
*  And Trump had 50 illegal fees. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=735.7s)]
*  That's like I mean, those dollars, it's it is a fixed pie. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=738.74s)]
*  Like there's a certain amount of small dollar Republican conservative donors. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=743.58s)]
*  There's a certain amount of money that's going to come flowing in. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=746.98s)]
*  And right now, 50 mil yoink into the legal fees. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=749.38s)]
*  And I've got bad news for them. It's about to get worse. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=756.26s)]
*  I mean, the guy is going to be in court the entire time that they are trying to raise [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=758.74s)]
*  money to run races. And it's not Donald Trump's not the only person in the Republican [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=763.7s)]
*  Party, right? They have Senate races. They have down ballot races. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=767.94s)]
*  There's a lot of other people who are hoping to have money. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=770.98s)]
*  And this is what has always been so crazy to me about the Republican Party in a normal [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=773.4200000000001s)]
*  world and in a healthy political environment. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=777.82s)]
*  They would be upset with him about this, about draining resources for the better [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=780.38s)]
*  of the party. But that's always been the thing about Donald Trump. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=785.5400000000001s)]
*  He doesn't care about the Republican Party. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=788.34s)]
*  And the less he cares about the Republican Party, the more desperately they are trying [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=790.6600000000001s)]
*  to help him and do whatever they can for him. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=795.7s)]
*  Always to the detriment of the party, certainly to the detriment of any kind of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=799.38s)]
*  principle or meaningful, ideological place, like thing that they want to do. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=803.9s)]
*  It's just all about Trump. They're not going to have a platform. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=811.82s)]
*  They're not going to be able to raise money for their Senate candidates. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=815.22s)]
*  They're just going to go all in on Trump. That's the only game in town anymore. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=817.0600000000001s)]
*  It is the whole Republican Party. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=820.1s)]
*  And Republicans have nobody to blame but themselves because they let this happen. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=821.98s)]
*  They could have stood up a million different times in a million different ways. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=826.58s)]
*  They chose not to. And that's why we're here. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=829.9s)]
*  Well, and to Sarah's point, Jess, I mean, you know, as a veteran of campaigns and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=832.14s)]
*  politics, like resources really do matter and they matter the more the lower down [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=836.4200000000001s)]
*  you get. Right. So like when you're talking about, you know, presidential campaigns, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=839.98s)]
*  it's like these are people with very high name recognition. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=843.54s)]
*  The marginal dollar matters less. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=845.98s)]
*  We're talking about a contested House race. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=847.38s)]
*  Like it matters a lot. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=849.94s)]
*  And again, he's going to face more legal troubles this year. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=851.26s)]
*  He's already got eighty three million dollars got paid. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=854.58s)]
*  Eugene Carroll could be two hundred million plus from New York. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=856.46s)]
*  We'll see. And then actually paying his lawyers. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=859.26s)]
*  And he the one thing he's gotten great at is small dollar donors off his legal [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=862.0600000000001s)]
*  fees. That is going to suck up even more of that money. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=866.02s)]
*  Well, that's his strategy. His strategy is to use every bit of legal liability [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=868.98s)]
*  that he has to raise small dollar donations. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=873.7s)]
*  And you're absolutely right about how important that is. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=876.5s)]
*  Lower down the ballot. If you have ten dollars to send to a political candidate, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=879.02s)]
*  send it to a state legislative race. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=883.62s)]
*  It will matter. It's a drop in the bucket for a presidential. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=885.82s)]
*  So he is he's just siphoning off everything that would possibly be able to help [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=888.62s)]
*  rebuild the Republican Party if and when he steps off of the stage, he's going to [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=894.34s)]
*  make sure that he leaves it just an absolute abject wasteland. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=898.7s)]
*  Yeah. And one of the arguments Nikki Haley is making right now is that she's [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=901.46s)]
*  pulling better than him. And also those will have implications for down ballot. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=905.82s)]
*  I think it's a totally legit argument based in data and a rational one. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=908.74s)]
*  I don't think anyone's listening or the people she needs to persuade are [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=913.18s)]
*  listening. But, you know, what can I do? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=916.3s)]
*  Jess McIntosh and Sarah Longwell. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=917.9s)]
*  Thank you both. Coming up, podcaster and part time Senator Ted Cruz complains [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=919.66s)]
*  he's been forsaken by his party. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=925.3s)]
*  But first, as they try to take back the White House, Republicans once again [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=927.42s)]
*  reveal the only policy, the only one that truly matters to them. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=930.0600000000001s)]
*  That's next. Something pretty amazing happened on Capitol Hill yesterday in [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=934.1800000000001s)]
*  the midst of an election year and deep political divisions, a big bipartisan [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=941.98s)]
*  majority in the House passed a major piece of legislation. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=945.42s)]
*  The 78 billion dollar tax bill that passed yesterday is a compromise that [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=949.38s)]
*  gives each party something it wants. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=953.62s)]
*  Democrats get an expansion of the child tax credit, albeit scaled back from the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=955.78s)]
*  version that passed in 2021 and lapsed after a year. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=960.18s)]
*  Legislation would get eligible families an average tax cut of six hundred and [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=963.78s)]
*  eighty dollars and lift as many as four hundred thousand children above the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=967.62s)]
*  poverty line in one year, according to estimates. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=970.98s)]
*  So that was a big priority for Democrats. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=974.1800000000001s)]
*  Now, you will never guess what Republicans wanted in exchange. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  A bunch of tax breaks for businesses and corporations. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=981.0200000000001s)]
*  And they got it. As Bloomberg explains, the bill would restore expired tax [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=983.46s)]
*  breaks, allowing businesses to more quickly recoup the cost of domestic [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=987.6600000000001s)]
*  research and development, interest on business loans and investment in [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=990.94s)]
*  equipment. Boeing, General Motors, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple are among [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=994.6600000000001s)]
*  the companies that stand to benefit. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=999.86s)]
*  Now, this is sort of a perfect illustration of the priorities of the two [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1002.66s)]
*  parties and whose material interests they pursue. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1005.42s)]
*  Democrats are like, please, just a few hundred dollars a month for families [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1007.9399999999999s)]
*  with kids. And Republicans responded, OK, if you give us tax breaks for some [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1010.9s)]
*  of the wealthiest companies in the world, we can get to a deal. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  But the compromise worked, at least in the House, and may not hold in the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1018.02s)]
*  Senate. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1021.8199999999999s)]
*  Passing a tax bill that makes the president look good, mail out checks before [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1023.58s)]
*  the election means that he could be reelected and then we won't extend the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1031.9s)]
*  2017 tax bill. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1036.42s)]
*  Oh, well, he's being honest about it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1038.46s)]
*  We don't want to do any good because it might help Biden. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1039.8600000000001s)]
*  For Grassley and some of his colleagues, it is more important to reelect Donald [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1044.22s)]
*  Trump than literally to put more money in working families' pockets or even in [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1047.26s)]
*  the coffers of big businesses. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1052.46s)]
*  So this will be a test for Trump's Republican Party. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1054.02s)]
*  Will they destroy a deal for political purposes or seize the opportunity [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1056.66s)]
*  actually get something done? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1061.1000000000001s)]
*  Right now, that very same question is hanging over another bipartisan deal that [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1063.38s)]
*  has been teetering on the edge of collapse. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1067.94s)]
*  You've probably heard about this one because after months of intense [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1069.82s)]
*  negotiations, a bipartisan group of senators hammered out an agreement on the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1072.5s)]
*  border. And it is pretty much a clear win for Republican policy priorities there. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1076.46s)]
*  The deal would, as far as we know, again, they haven't released a text, impose new [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1082.22s)]
*  limits and standards for people seeking asylum in the United States. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1085.8200000000002s)]
*  It would speed up the processing of those asylum claims and make it harder for [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1089.54s)]
*  migrants to appeal if they are rejected. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1093.8600000000001s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security will also gain new authority to basically [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1096.5s)]
*  close the border if the number of crossings passes a certain threshold, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1099.46s)]
*  though it's a little unclear how you implement that. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1102.94s)]
*  You got Republican senators, including key negotiator James Langford of Oklahoma, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1105.5s)]
*  who are desperately begging in every venue they can for their colleagues to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1109.18s)]
*  support what they say is like enormous win. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1114.46s)]
*  The best deal they're going to get. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1116.66s)]
*  This is a historic moment to reform the border in a way that would give tools to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1119.82s)]
*  the next president they don't have today and lessen the flow to take pressure off [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1124.98s)]
*  people in Texas and Arizona and all throughout the border. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1129.9s)]
*  The Democrats will not give us will not give us anything close to this if we have [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1133.38s)]
*  to get 60 votes in the United States Senate in a Republican majority. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1140.5400000000002s)]
*  We have a unique opportunity here and the timing is right to do this. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1143.7s)]
*  This is our moment to actually say, let's do as much as we can possibly get done. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1149.3400000000001s)]
*  But this has a very significant change in our border security. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1153.5800000000002s)]
*  And that's what Americans are crying for. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1156.3000000000002s)]
*  By the way, everyone basically agrees on that. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1158.18s)]
*  I mean, immigration advocates don't like the bill at all, are very worried about it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1159.86s)]
*  Again, we don't have bill tech yet. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1165.26s)]
*  So like they're not just like Trump and this up. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1166.3799999999999s)]
*  This is true. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1168.8999999999999s)]
*  OK, so here they got to win. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1169.58s)]
*  But once again, what's going to happen? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1171.02s)]
*  Well, the problem is Donald Trump and his insatiable thirst for another term in the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1172.1399999999999s)]
*  White House. You see, Trump and his allies desperately want to use the crisis of the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1175.86s)]
*  border and the real human lives on each side of it as a political tool. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1179.58s)]
*  So what they're going to try to do is just kill the deal. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1183.4199999999998s)]
*  So the border remains in, as they say, crisis and they can attack President Joe Biden [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1186.6200000000001s)]
*  on the campaign trail. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1191.98s)]
*  There is zero chance I will support this horrible open borders betrayal of America. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1194.3000000000002s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1200.7s)]
*  I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill, a bad bill you can't have. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1202.14s)]
*  And that's what was happening in the House. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1205.98s)]
*  Donald Trump named three things in the bill. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1209.94s)]
*  Just give me three. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1212.8200000000002s)]
*  It's funny to even think about. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1214.3799999999999s)]
*  So as usual, Trump's lackeys in Congress are lining up to do his bidding. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1217.1s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson already called the deal dead on arrival in the House. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1220.62s)]
*  So now you've got on both these issues, right, two bipartisan compromises in each [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1223.98s)]
*  House, the border and taxes, and Republicans face this really interesting test. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1228.34s)]
*  What do they actually care about and what do they just like to talk about? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1232.54s)]
*  And I'm going to make a prediction. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1236.58s)]
*  I think you're going to kill the border deal because they like to talk about [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1238.78s)]
*  immigration, the politics of the border, and they love beating up on Democrats and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1242.9s)]
*  love beating up on immigrants. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1246.18s)]
*  But they don't actually care about the substance of it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1247.8600000000001s)]
*  They don't care about the policy, about improving it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1250.3400000000001s)]
*  Just look at what happened the last time they unified government. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1253.18s)]
*  Remember this happened the first half of Donald Trump's term. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1255.7s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1259.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, right. Yeah, nothing. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1260.66s)]
*  They didn't build the wall. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1261.7800000000002s)]
*  They didn't stem the flow of migrants seeking asylum. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1262.8600000000001s)]
*  They did absolutely nothing to solve the problem when they had unified control. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1265.38s)]
*  But you know what they did do? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1268.6200000000001s)]
*  You know what they got done. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1269.98s)]
*  They enacted, again, massive tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1271.38s)]
*  because at its core, underneath all the rhetoric, cutting taxes for businesses, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1275.58s)]
*  corporations and rich people is it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1281.66s)]
*  It's the single policy focus, the modern Republican Party. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1284.1s)]
*  It is the only thing, the only thing they are actually invested in getting done. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1287.58s)]
*  And so my prediction is that they find a way to pass the tax bill, that it will pass [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1292.34s)]
*  and the border bill will hit the cutting room floor. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1297.74s)]
*  We'll see if I'm right. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1300.98s)]
*  I'm right now, as you know, in a very tough reelection race in Texas. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1304.8600000000001s)]
*  The Democrats, Chuck Schumer has made clear I'm his number one target. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1309.54s)]
*  The Democrats intend to spend over a hundred million dollars to defeat me in Texas. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1313.18s)]
*  We just had a poll last week that showed it as a one point race. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1317.94s)]
*  And yet we can expect Mitch again not to spend any money to defend me. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1321.82s)]
*  I'm sitting in a glass house throwing stones. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1327.82s)]
*  Take it from someone who knows that guy really likes the sound of his own voice. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1330.02s)]
*  The last time that Ted Cruz ran for reelection, he sweated out a narrow victory [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1334.78s)]
*  over Beto O'Rourke of less than three points. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1338.9s)]
*  You would think that would be a wake up call for the Texas senator to start laser [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1341.1399999999999s)]
*  focusing on the needs of his constituents. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1344.58s)]
*  But instead, just over two years after his narrow victory, he tried to secretly jet [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1346.58s)]
*  off to Cancun during the worst weather disaster his state had seen in a long time, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1351.3s)]
*  one that killed nearly 250 people. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1355.18s)]
*  Recently, it seems like he's basically reduced himself to being a part time [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1358.3799999999999s)]
*  senator and nearly full time podcaster. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1362.06s)]
*  Get this, last week he posted five different episodes, five different podcast [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1365.62s)]
*  episodes. He's a senator. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1371.3799999999999s)]
*  He is now facing another real reelection challenge. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1374.34s)]
*  As you heard, he's a little worried he's not getting the support he needs from [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1377.02s)]
*  fellow Republicans. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1380.1399999999999s)]
*  Congressman Colin Allred of Texas is running in the Democratic race against Texas [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1381.6999999999998s)]
*  state Senator Roland Gutierrez and others to challenge Cruz. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1385.26s)]
*  He previously served in the Department of Housing and Urban Development under [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1388.3799999999999s)]
*  President Obama. For that, he was an NFL linebacker. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1391.74s)]
*  And I just learned he's a fourth generation Texan. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1394.22s)]
*  He joins right now. Good to have you here. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1396.34s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1397.34s)]
*  OK, this is people might think this is weird or petty, but I'm going to talk. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1398.98s)]
*  I think it's weird for a U.S. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1402.42s)]
*  senator to do five podcasts episode a week. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1403.86s)]
*  I'm not wrong. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1406.34s)]
*  That's right. No, that's right. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1407.06s)]
*  I mean, it's very time consuming. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1407.94s)]
*  Like when I appear on a podcast, it takes time. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1409.7s)]
*  But being the host and he normally does three a week. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1412.18s)]
*  So I was actually news for me that he was up to five. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1415.46s)]
*  He's a media personality. He's not serious about being a senator. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1418.94s)]
*  I feel like there's some level at which maybe you're a help. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1420.94s)]
*  If you beat him, you help him because he really just wants to do that full time, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1423.54s)]
*  which, again, no shade. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1427.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? But I mean, you might be giving him a hand. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1429.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he wants to do. He's not a serious legislator. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1431.62s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about these negotiations in the Senate right now. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1434.1s)]
*  You'll never see him a part of those negotiations. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1437.22s)]
*  He won't be rolling up his sleeves and trying to figure out a compromise on how [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1439.26s)]
*  we can legislate to move forward. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1442.26s)]
*  This is what he does. He goes on podcasts. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1444.18s)]
*  He goes on cable news. And that's what he does. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1445.94s)]
*  And in fact, I mean, this I thought this border story that we just talked about, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1447.78s)]
*  you would have a lot to say about. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1451.06s)]
*  You have been critical of the handling by this president, Joe Biden of the border. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1452.34s)]
*  You are among three Texas Democrats who voted to condemn the president's [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1457.34s)]
*  handling southern border. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1460.1s)]
*  You touted your own bipartisan legislation would help secure the border, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1462.18s)]
*  provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers and others who are living here. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1465.34s)]
*  Follow laws, surge resources to border patrol and border community. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1468.26s)]
*  So you've been sort of trying to work on something like this. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1471.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1473.98s)]
*  The Senate compromise doesn't even have some of the stuff in here. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1475.1399999999999s)]
*  Like, there's no path to citizenship for the dreamers. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1478.62s)]
*  All that. Right. That's right. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1480.5s)]
*  You I know we don't have paper on it yet, but would you support that legislation? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1481.6999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think so. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1485.5s)]
*  We haven't gotten all the details, but from what we are seeing, it looks like [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1486.6599999999999s)]
*  it's an attempt to deal with an asylum system that's broken to a faster process [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1490.06s)]
*  and to set some standards that I think probably have to be set in terms of [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1494.86s)]
*  what's the threshold to have your asylum claim heard. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1497.9s)]
*  But listen, you know, Ted Cruz is not going to be a part of any of this. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1500.8600000000001s)]
*  And he said in a Senate meeting, it kind of leaked out, I guess, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1504.02s)]
*  a lunch meeting of theirs. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1507.42s)]
*  He's worried about the politics of it, not the policy, the politics of it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1508.74s)]
*  And that's where the cynicism comes in. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1512.22s)]
*  That's what I think Texans are so sick of. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1514.22s)]
*  I mean, I think he said both privately and publicly. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1515.74s)]
*  So I think what happened was that there was that caucus lunch [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1517.98s)]
*  they all had after the deal was struck. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1520.7800000000002s)]
*  And it was after Trump won New Hampshire. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1522.5s)]
*  McConnell's like the politics of this has changed. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1524.3000000000002s)]
*  We need the crisis. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1526.5s)]
*  Basically, he didn't say this, but we want the crisis to keep going. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1527.5s)]
*  I guess it makes me wonder, like, maybe they don't think it's correct. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1531.3s)]
*  I mean, like, I just find it pretty wild. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1534.5s)]
*  Like, to me, it's a really defining issue about the nature of these different senators. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1536.78s)]
*  Like, Langford is a conservative dude in your neighboring state of Oklahoma. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1540.7s)]
*  He's not like a squish. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1545.22s)]
*  And he's running around being like, guys, we got it. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1546.66s)]
*  Let's do it. That's right. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1549.26s)]
*  Also for Texas, you know, we're a border state. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1550.06s)]
*  And so there's probably no state that would that needs this to be addressed more. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1552.86s)]
*  The vast majority of the crossings are happening in Texas. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1556.26s)]
*  That's right. You know, we have a record number in December of over 300000. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1558.94s)]
*  Texas feels that. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1562.5s)]
*  So you would think that a Texas senator would then say, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1563.86s)]
*  I want to respond to this and find a way legislatively. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1566.1s)]
*  But of course, as we saw in the clip there and as we know from his character, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1569.26s)]
*  he's just looking for the next election so he can keep podcasting. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1572.5s)]
*  One of the one of the issues that I think there will be a very clear difference [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1575.98s)]
*  between if you were to win the nomination, I think any Democrat, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1578.98s)]
*  frankly, against Ted Cruz will be on the issue of abortion. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1581.82s)]
*  He is strongly in favor of the Supreme Court's decision, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1584.42s)]
*  strongly opposed to abortion rights. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1588.62s)]
*  I want to just play a little bit of your campaign ad, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1590.7s)]
*  because I think it highlights the message that you or other Democrats, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1593.58s)]
*  not just in Texas, are going to be running on in this year. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1597.34s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1599.54s)]
*  Your state has a very restrictive ban. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1614.98s)]
*  It was at the front edge of this, obviously, with the SB8 law. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1616.78s)]
*  Do you think. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1621.58s)]
*  A abortion rights referendum statewide to win in Texas? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1624.26s)]
*  I think it would. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1628.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't think the legislature will let us do that. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1629.5s)]
*  They never will. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1631.06s)]
*  But you know, what's happening in Texas is a tragedy. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1632.58s)]
*  It really is. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1635.18s)]
*  What we are seeing is what a total ban on abortion looks like, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1636.74s)]
*  which is, you know, a mother of two was a much wanted third pregnancy. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1639.46s)]
*  Let's go to the emergency room four times. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1643.46s)]
*  Her doctor tells her she needs a medically necessary abortion. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1645.7s)]
*  She asked her state to get that care close to home and they say no. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1648.02s)]
*  And they don't just say no. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1651.34s)]
*  They said, we're going to prosecute your doctor, your hospital. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1652.06s)]
*  You're going to be subject to this ridiculous bounty law that we have in this state. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1654.94s)]
*  We have counties saying you can't drive through our county [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1657.54s)]
*  if you're going to use those roads to access an abortion. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1660.3799999999999s)]
*  There's one thing I know about Texans. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1662.82s)]
*  And as you said, I'm a fourth generation Texan. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1664.18s)]
*  I went to Baylor. My family's from Brownsville, grew up in Dallas. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1665.86s)]
*  I know who we are. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1668.1s)]
*  We believe in freedom. And this is not freedom. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1669.4199999999998s)]
*  This is not who we are. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1672.54s)]
*  And that's why we have to make sure that folks know the only way we can fix this [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1673.82s)]
*  is by beating Ted Cruz and codifying at the federal level. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1677.02s)]
*  Roe v. Wade, our state's not going to do it, but we can do it at the federal level. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1679.86s)]
*  We can restore this right. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1682.58s)]
*  Do you that the president had a rally where he said he pledged to do that. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1683.74s)]
*  There have been there been this sort of push and pull about a clarity [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1688.26s)]
*  on the message from Democrats, right, which is like you can't unring the bell of Roe. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1691.02s)]
*  The court is what it is. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1695.58s)]
*  But you think do you think there's unanimity across all aspects [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1696.62s)]
*  of the Democratic Party that this is a singular focus for all of you [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1700.22s)]
*  running in contested swing races in the House, in Senate races and at the top of the ticket? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1703.26s)]
*  Well, it should be because we have to. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1707.78s)]
*  We passed in the last Congress a couple of times when Women's Health Protection Act, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1710.06s)]
*  which would codify Roe. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1713.5s)]
*  We couldn't get to the Senate even though we had 50 votes. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1714.74s)]
*  When I'm in the Senate, we will have to get that done [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1717.3s)]
*  because we have to restore these rights. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1719.7s)]
*  And I'm a voting rights lawyer as well. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1721.38s)]
*  Before I came to Congress, we have to restore that right as well. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1722.98s)]
*  We have to go back and I think solidify some of these foundational rights [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1725.74s)]
*  that have been eroded by what I think is a rogue Supreme Court [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1730.14s)]
*  and also, of course, years of inaction and unable to get things through the Senate. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1733.38s)]
*  Final question for you. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1737.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you think you can go talk to the folks of Texas about this [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1739.1000000000001s)]
*  Biden economy or this economy? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1742.74s)]
*  Well, listen, with a story to tell. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1744.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, I come from a family where I was raised by a single mom [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1746.38s)]
*  as a public school teacher. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1750.0200000000002s)]
*  We were kind of in the sense where you swipe your debit card [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1751.3000000000002s)]
*  and you pray when you go to the store. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1753.74s)]
*  So I know what families have been facing, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1755.5800000000002s)]
*  but I also know who's fighting to lower your costs. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1758.42s)]
*  Who wants to expand the child tax credit? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1760.54s)]
*  So 16 million kids will benefit from it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1762.5s)]
*  Who wants to lower your health care costs and cap the cost of insulin [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1764.54s)]
*  at 35 bucks a month? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1767.54s)]
*  Ted Cruz voted against that. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1768.6200000000001s)]
*  Who are they looking out for? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1770.38s)]
*  As I think you talked about in the previous segment. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1771.66s)]
*  And who are we looking out for? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1773.42s)]
*  We want to lower your costs. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1774.58s)]
*  We want to make life more affordable for you. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1775.82s)]
*  Want to give you a chance to chase your version of the American dream. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1777.54s)]
*  We're on and I'm on your side. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1779.66s)]

*  their approach to a more focused and controlled, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1908.74s)]

*  President Biden today was focused on violence in another Palestinian [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1925.74s)]
*  territory, the West Bank. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1928.6999999999998s)]
*  Administration rolled out an executive order to freeze any U.S. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1930.46s)]
*  assets of violent Israeli settlers. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1933.58s)]
*  West Bank hasn't gotten the same attention as the war in Gaza in the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1936.18s)]
*  aftermath of October 7th Hamas attack on Israel. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1938.98s)]
*  But 300 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis there just since the [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1942.42s)]
*  war started, with much of the violence coming from settlers who have [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1945.66s)]
*  seized Palestinian properties, burned homes and businesses, intimidated [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1949.14s)]
*  residents into leaving and evacuating their villages outright. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1953.26s)]
*  Netanyahu government, which is politically aligned with the settler [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1956.7s)]
*  movement, has downplayed that violence. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1959.74s)]
*  But Biden took action after the shooting death of an American teen [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1961.9s)]
*  who was visiting the West Bank last month. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1965.94s)]
*  Witnesses say he was shot by a settler. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1968.7s)]
*  This is, of course, also a domestic political challenge for Biden. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1971.5s)]
*  His support for Israel's war appears to be hurting him significantly [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1974.14s)]
*  with young voters. It shows up in polling after polling, and it is [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1978.22s)]
*  definitely hurting him with Muslim and Arab American voters, as evidenced [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1981.3s)]
*  by the protests that met him when he made a campaign stop today in Michigan. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1985.1000000000001s)]
*  Leaders of the state's Arab American community also refused to meet with [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1989.6599999999999s)]
*  Biden's campaign team last week. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1993.4199999999998s)]
*  And an economist YouGov poll last month showed that 50 percent of people [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=1995.58s)]
*  who voted for Biden in 2020 believe Israel is committing genocide against [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2001.1399999999999s)]

*  It's clear Israel's war on Gaza and the American support for it is [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2009.34s)]
*  currently the biggest foreign policy issue of the campaign season. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2012.58s)]
*  And what's incredible is the man who's almost certainly going to face off [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2016.14s)]
*  against Biden in November has said nothing of substance about it. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2019.7s)]
*  In fact, as we saw yesterday, he just deflects questions about it outright. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2023.8600000000001s)]
*  If you were in the White House today, would you strike a long record? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2028.6200000000001s)]
*  It wouldn't have happened if I were in the White House. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2031.6200000000001s)]
*  You would have never had this attack. You would have never had the attack on Israel. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2034.14s)]
*  You would have never had the attack on Ukraine. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2037.22s)]
*  You would not have inflation that was, you know, just is destroying our country. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2039.9s)]
*  Nothing in that would happen. Therefore, I have no position. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2045.42s)]
*  Therefore, you can just project whatever you want onto me. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2047.8200000000002s)]
*  See how that works. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2049.98s)]
*  There was a time in American politics not that long ago when a leading candidate, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2051.62s)]
*  if something happened in foreign relations like this, they would host like a press [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2055.1400000000003s)]
*  call with their campaign's policy experts. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2058.62s)]
*  They would put out a policy paper and a statement. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2060.82s)]
*  They might even make a speech because a big part of campaigning for public service [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2062.98s)]
*  and the presidency used to be having a position on major policy questions. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2067.54s)]
*  Not for Donald Trump. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2073.82s)]
*  There is literally no position, zero position whatsoever from him on the Gaza War. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2075.3s)]
*  But here's the thing. We don't have to guess what Donald Trump's policy as [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2082.7000000000003s)]
*  president would be because, again, he was actually in the White House. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2085.7000000000003s)]
*  He has an actual record in the Middle East. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2089.5800000000004s)]
*  A reminder of what that is. Next. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2091.98s)]
*  Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2096.78s)]
*  I terminated that deal. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2100.7000000000003s)]
*  I terminated that deal. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2103.02s)]
*  And we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2107.42s)]
*  That's for the evangelicals. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2113.94s)]
*  And Golan Heights. Don't forget Golan Heights. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2116.06s)]
*  We did Golan Heights. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2118.46s)]
*  So we've done a lot. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2120.26s)]
*  That's for the evangelicals. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2122.34s)]
*  While Donald Trump avoids taking a policy position on what has happened in the Middle [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2124.22s)]
*  East now, he was not shy about his position on the Middle East when he was [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2127.3s)]
*  actually in the White House. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2130.06s)]
*  For those four years, Trump was squarely aligned with priorities of the most [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2131.58s)]
*  right-wing forces in Israeli politics. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2135.86s)]

*  He ripped up the Iran deal as they wanted, which was the highest priority [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2140.7s)]
*  for the right-wing government in Israel. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2144.1s)]
*  He recognized the contested Golan Heights as part of Israel. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2146.62s)]
*  Those are all priorities of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2149.34s)]

*  Tommy, I wanted to talk to you because I've been listening to your podcast [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2169.34s)]
*  about this stuff, and I think you and I have similar views about the current [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2171.42s)]
*  trajectory of American foreign policy there under Biden, that it can't go on [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2176.3s)]
*  like this, that it's causing real damage, both politically, strategically, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2182.62s)]
*  and morally in the humanitarian sense. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2187.3s)]
*  But it is crazy to me that in the midst of a campaign, there's just no question [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2189.74s)]
*  about what the policy of the other guy is or would be. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2197.06s)]
*  You're right. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2203.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's stunning, Chris. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2203.62s)]
*  It's funny listening to you talk about how back in the day, there would be a [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2204.4599999999996s)]
*  conference call with foreign policy advisors and op-eds, and it's just like, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2207.7s)]
*  oh yeah, an entirely different era of politics when we were coming up and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2211.4199999999996s)]
*  running against people like John McCain or Mitt Romney. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2214.62s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2216.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, Trump does have this record on Israel recognizing the Golan Heights. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2217.3s)]
*  He cut funding to the Palestinians, to UNRWA, which was another thing the [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2221.2200000000003s)]

*  gave huge concessions to autocrats in the region in exchange for normalizing [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2230.1400000000003s)]
*  relations with Israel. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2234.94s)]
*  In the case of the UAE's deal with the Israelis, it was basically a huge arm [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2236.7400000000002s)]
*  sales agreement between the U.S. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2240.94s)]
*  and the UAE. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2242.7799999999997s)]
*  And unfortunately, those Abraham Accord deals made the Palestinians feel [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2243.58s)]
*  completely forgotten about and left behind because leaders who once championed [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2249.22s)]
*  their cause were now normalizing relations with Israel, and they felt [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2253.3799999999997s)]
*  forgotten. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2256.8599999999997s)]
*  The Palestinians did, and they felt forgotten in large part because Netanyahu [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2257.54s)]
*  told them they had been forgotten. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2261.4199999999996s)]
*  So Trump certainly poured gas on the fire that got us to today. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2262.66s)]
*  Yes, there was a lot of stuffing, to mix metaphors, stuffing powder into that [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2266.5s)]
*  powder keg over that period of time. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2270.4599999999996s)]
*  I want to just, this is sort of a nerdy point, but I'm going to just go with it [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2272.62s)]
*  here. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2275.42s)]
*  Just so that people don't think I'm crazy, like you worked on the O8 campaign [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2276.8199999999997s)]
*  and O12, like it really was a thing. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2280.2999999999997s)]
*  You're running for office. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2283.58s)]
*  Something happens in the world. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2284.66s)]
*  And you've got this like little committee that will be like people who are real [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2287.1s)]
*  experts on the politics of the thing. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2291.94s)]
*  And they'll be like, all this work will get done. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2294.22s)]
*  What is our position? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2296.74s)]
*  What do we think on this? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2298.02s)]
*  There'll be memos that, right? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2299.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not crazy about this. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2300.62s)]
*  Like this was a real thing that used to happen in American political campaigns [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2301.78s)]
*  for president. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2305.6200000000003s)]
*  All the time. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2307.78s)]
*  2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, it upended the campaign the entire weekend. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2308.86s)]
*  The next couple of weeks was taken over by conversations about foreign policy, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2314.9s)]
*  getting experts on the phone, talking to reporters about our position. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2318.7000000000003s)]
*  It was an important, substantive debate about how McCain and Obama viewed the [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2321.82s)]
*  world and responded to these things. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2326.0600000000004s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2327.6200000000003s)]
*  In this case, Trump just won't say anything about it, except never would have [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2328.02s)]
*  happened if I was president. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2331.58s)]
*  I think he also once said the Civil War never would have happened if he had been [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2333.22s)]
*  president. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2336.62s)]
*  So, you know, maybe we take that with a grain of salt. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2337.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2339.58s)]
*  I mean, it is wild to think of like how much the political class of press would [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2339.86s)]
*  have freaked out if Barack Obama in 2008 said, well, I don't know, tell you, it [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2344.8199999999997s)]
*  never would have happened. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2347.9s)]
*  They never would have invaded Georgia if Ivory was president. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2348.5s)]
*  Like that doesn't fly. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2352.1s)]
*  And I think it's smart politically, precisely for the political reasons that [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2354.62s)]
*  were identified. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2359.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, that polling number to me was pretty shocking that 50 percent, 50 [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2360.42s)]
*  percent of Biden voters believe that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2364.62s)]
*  Just purely as a political issue with your own voters. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2372.5s)]
*  That is a pretty intense red flag. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2377.1s)]
*  And Trump and the Republicans are smart enough to recognize why say anything [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2379.3s)]
*  when this is such a brutal issue for the Democratic coalition. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2383.1s)]
*  Yes, Trump is smart when it comes to politics. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2387.66s)]
*  He knows that the hard right pro-Israel evangelicals will never vote for Biden. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2390.18s)]
*  They will always be with him. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2395.7s)]
*  He knows that the progressive left is upset with Biden. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2397.22s)]
*  And he also knows that there's the Tucker Carlson right that is more, you know, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2400.54s)]
*  America first. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2404.58s)]
*  Why would we intervene overseas? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2405.5s)]
*  They hate this war. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2407.58s)]
*  They think Lindsey Graham is crazy. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2408.62s)]
*  So he's just going to sit silently. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2410.14s)]
*  He's a Rourke's Act test. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2411.82s)]
*  You see what you want to see. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2412.82s)]
*  And this gets back to the sort of the sort of ways, the norms and rules of [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2414.22s)]
*  running for president have so sort of deteriorated because one of the things [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2418.74s)]
*  that used to happen was everyone wanted to do that. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2421.74s)]
*  Like the whole point is right. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2424.7799999999997s)]
*  You never want to take a position on anything when you're running for office. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2426.54s)]
*  That's contentious because it's easier not to. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2430.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2433.14s)]
*  But the whole point of the mechanics of what a campaign used to be, which Trump [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2433.98s)]
*  has sort of unilaterally destroyed, was to force politicians to do exactly that. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2438.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2446.06s)]
*  I mean, they didn't have a platform in 2020. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2446.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2448.06s)]
*  I mean, so yes, he's he is running as a blank slate and folks see celebrity and [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2448.22s)]
*  they see bravado and they see, I guess, you know, four years in office and they [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2453.06s)]
*  there's some under some economic sentiment that is carried over that they feel like [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2457.54s)]
*  they benefited from in the Trump years. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2462.14s)]
*  But yeah, he's running on nothing now. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2463.58s)]
*  David Friedman, who was the Trump ambassador to Israel, which again, personnel [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2465.3399999999997s)]
*  is politics. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2469.58s)]
*  He basically said, look, he criticized Biden saying he said at no time did the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2471.18s)]
*  United States put any handcuffs or limitation on Israel's ability to respond. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2476.02s)]
*  You know very well, particularly in foreign policy, personnel is policy and we [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2480.38s)]
*  know who the personnel would be under Trump administration. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2484.3s)]
*  I don't think it's at all muddy. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2486.5s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I think that if you don't like what Joe Biden is doing with respect [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2489.7s)]
*  to Gaza right now, you would hate what Donald Trump would be doing. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2494.5s)]
*  There is absolutely no consideration for human rights. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2497.46s)]
*  I think he would give Bibi Netanyahu carte blanche to conduct any military [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2500.5s)]
*  campaign he wanted. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2504.66s)]
*  There would be no pressure on him to worry about civilian casualties and it would [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2505.62s)]
*  be it would be terrible. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2510.14s)]
*  But there's just one bipartisan point I want to make, Chris, which is that, you [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2511.46s)]
*  know, you hear all this talk about the need to restore deterrence against Iran. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2515.02s)]
*  And that's always code for revenge or bombing them or some sort of military [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2518.38s)]
*  campaign. No one is out there making a case for diplomacy. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2522.2599999999998s)]
*  The periods of time when we saw these attacks on U.S. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2525.62s)]
*  forces in places like Iraq and in Syria either stop or slow down was when the U.S. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2528.5s)]
*  and Iran were engaged in talks either directly or through Oman or some other [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2534.46s)]
*  country. That is how we keep our personnel safe abroad. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2539.26s)]
*  It's not by escalating these wars. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2542.38s)]
*  It's by talking to our enemies. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2544.1s)]
*  That's what diplomacy is. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2545.86s)]
*  Totally great. Tommy Vitor, thank you very much. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GYqKn8Ra0&t=2547.1800000000003s)]
