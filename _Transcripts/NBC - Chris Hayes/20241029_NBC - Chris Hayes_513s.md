# ‘Damn good speech’: Maddow reacts to Harris' closing argument remarks
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is)
*  Joining me now, Rachel Maddow, host of the Rachel Maddow Show, Joy Reid, host of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=0.0s)]
*  Readout on MSNBC. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=3.52s)]
*  We were speaking before the speech and we got to see it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=4.88s)]
*  Rachel, your thoughts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=8.0s)]
*  This is a damn good speech. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=11.48s)]
*  This strikes me as essentially the bookend to her Democratic National Convention speech. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=13.92s)]
*  Her acceptance of the Democratic Party's nomination hit some of these same lines, but she knew [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=20.28s)]
*  she was speaking to the Democratic Party and to those who had elevated her within that party. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=26.46s)]
*  Tonight, she was speaking to the whole country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=30.46s)]
*  She overtly asked for people's vote. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=32.620000000000005s)]
*  She overtly reintroduced herself to the country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=34.900000000000006s)]
*  She said, I know a lot of people say they don't know enough about me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=37.86s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=40.94s)]
*  But she talked about her upbringing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=41.94s)]
*  She talked about having worked most of her career outside of Washington. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=43.34s)]
*  And she ended with a big presidential flourish, a big presidential vision. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=48.14s)]
*  Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=53.62s)]
*  Across the generations, Americans have preserved that freedom and expanded it and in so doing, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  proved to the world that a government of, by, and for the people is strong and can endure. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=64.62s)]
*  The United States of America, she said, is not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=69.94s)]
*  The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=76.17999999999999s)]
*  She is not speaking to people who already support her there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=81.62s)]
*  She is speaking to people who may not have been inclined to vote for her, who may not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=85.78s)]
*  have felt comfortable with her, who may not have felt like it was a worthy cause to get [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=89.7s)]
*  up off the couch and go vote for anybody. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=94.7s)]
*  She's there to say, listen, I embody the future of this country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=96.78s)]
*  And the other guy embodies the end of the American democratic experiment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=100.98s)]
*  And it's worth voting for me because I will protect this country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=105.7s)]
*  And that is strength personified. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=109.42s)]
*  She did a very good job delivering this speech. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=111.86s)]
*  And I think it was probably the most important speech of her life thus far. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=114.1s)]
*  Joy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=117.58s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=118.58s)]
*  She said, it is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and the division. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=120.02s)]
*  It's time to turn the page to a new vision for America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=127.14s)]
*  I wrote that line down as well as the line that Rachel Maddow just read to you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=130.18s)]
*  This was an excellent speech. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=134.48s)]
*  But what strikes me is that what she said, talking about herself being a child of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=135.92s)]
*  civil rights movement, her parents taking her to marches in a stroller, she described [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=141.28s)]
*  growing up and watching her mom work out the bills and figure out how to buy her first [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=146.88s)]
*  home and stand at that Formica yellow table. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  She described a middle-class upbringing, an approachable upbringing that people can relate [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=155.28s)]
*  to, a relatable person who talked about working for the people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  She talked about her biography a bit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=164.44s)]
*  But I think what really struck me was not just the delivery of the speech, which to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=166.76s)]
*  Rachel's point was very well done. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=170.52s)]
*  The setting was iconic with that cinematic look where you could sort of see the Capitol [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=172.52s)]
*  blurred behind her, the sort of beauty of the vision of it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=177.6s)]
*  But we stand at the brink of potentially electing our first woman president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=181.32s)]
*  We stand at the brink of doing something that Liberia was able to do, that Pakistan was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=188.72s)]
*  able to do, that Israel, that England, but that we have not done, that Mexico just did, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=193.44000000000003s)]
*  that we stand at the brink of that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=199.28s)]
*  And for the 75,000 some odd people who stood at the ellipse, their memories of the ellipse, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  their vision of the ellipse will not be about January 6th, 2021. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=206.52s)]
*  It will be about being there tonight, listening to the daughter of immigrants say that the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=211.36s)]
*  tyrant that we should oppose today is somebody who spurns immigrants despite two of his three [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=218.36s)]
*  wives being immigrants, is somebody whose closing argument was to attack immigrants, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  to attack strivers, to attack dreamers, to attack the people who make our country great. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  And what she says is that America doesn't have to be made great. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  It is great. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  And it's great because of all of us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=240.96s)]
*  And regardless of party, it's great because of you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  And so this ask for the vote, which is the primary job of a political candidate, I think [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=246.12s)]
*  this ask was put in terms that are both inspiring and fundamental to those of us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  We children of immigrants, we have a little bit of a rose-colored view of America. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=257.0s)]
*  We kind of come with it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=260.5s)]
*  We're kind of born with it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=261.5s)]
*  It's sort of a thing that we get when we come out of the womb of our immigrant parent who [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=262.5s)]
*  came here on purpose. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=265.92s)]
*  And I think whether you are somebody who came and became an American citizen on purpose [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=267.66s)]
*  deliberately as an immigrant or somebody whose lineage goes back all the way to the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=271.96s)]
*  beginning and its flawed beginning, what Kamala Harris is saying, you're part of that mosaic. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=277.0s)]
*  And so I think it was both her best speech, it was her most important speech, and the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=282.68s)]
*  location of it made it literally iconic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=287.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=291.08s)]
*  And I think the part about the biography is interesting to me because it speaks to something [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=292.08s)]
*  that's distinct here, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=297.58s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden has one of the longest records in public life of anyone. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=299.6s)]
*  In fact, he has this crazy sort of bookend, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=305.36s)]
*  Elected at 29 and serving the youngest possible center, oldest, oldest president, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=309.24s)]
*  And spent decades building this sort of identity and brands, Grant and Joe, middle class, telling [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=314.7s)]
*  that story. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=320.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris has not had that lifetime in the public eye. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=321.28s)]
*  She is the vice president, not the president. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=324.48s)]
*  There's a sort of biographical question of like, why are you doing this? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=327.2s)]
*  What are you in it for? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=330.96s)]
*  Which she took time again, one week before the election, having run only 100 days, right, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=332.84s)]
*  in the strangest, wildest campaign that any of us have seen in our lifetime, to take some [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=337.0s)]
*  time to talk about that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  I thought that was really interesting and very efficient how quickly and deftly they [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=344.56s)]
*  did that, but it was interesting that like they want to send that message to folks that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=347.96s)]
*  feel like I still don't quite know you or what is animating you, Rachel, that this is [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=352.24s)]
*  what's animating me. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=356.8s)]
*  Like this is, this is why I'm doing this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=357.8s)]
*  I think they're, they're reading the certain, what's the phrase we're supposed to use now? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=361.04s)]
*  That weird anic data, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=364.72s)]
*  It's not exactly data, but it's sort of more than anecdotes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=366.56s)]
*  Where you certainly there are people who are diehard Trump supporters. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=370.36s)]
*  Certainly there are people who are diehard Kamala Harris supporters. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  But when it comes to people who are neither strong supporters of either, and they have [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=376.44s)]
*  to decide what they're going to do in this election, whether they're going to vote and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=380.56s)]
*  you are anecdotally hearing and a lot of that man of the street stuff and a lot of those [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=384.76s)]
*  those surveys that allow people to do something other than just check or no, check yes or [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=389.8s)]
*  no, that their biggest concern about Kamala Harris is that they don't know much about [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  her. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=396.56s)]
*  And so even this late in her career, you know, even as she's 60 years old in the serving [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=397.56s)]
*  vice president of the United States and was the attorney general of the biggest state [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=401.68s)]
*  in the country and she was, you know, Senator, Senator before she was vice president and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=405.08s)]
*  all those things. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=408.92s)]
*  And even as she has been campaigning for these months since President Biden dropped out, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  they recognize, I think, that people who are wavering and not sure what they're going to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  do or whether they're going to vote need to know more about her. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=417.72s)]
*  And so this was her honoring that, you know, meeting that in good faith and not being resentful [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=420.76000000000005s)]
*  about it and not, you know, coming up with a fairy tale about it, but being very real [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  about it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=430.18s)]
*  I'll also just say in just very practical and perhaps slightly caddy terms that Vice [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=431.18s)]
*  President Harris gives a good speech, but I feel like I know what the cadence and the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=435.82s)]
*  sort of body language is of a Kamala Harris speech. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=440.34s)]
*  This actually had a lot more texture to it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  She was much less just the practiced politico here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  She was showing humanity, showing a little personality, showing a little humor, you know, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=452.5s)]
*  showing just a little bit more of range of emotion for women in the public eye. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=457.17999999999995s)]
*  We all know that you are that the range that you're allowed to express in terms of emotion [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=461.28s)]
*  and animation is about yay wide. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFah0hXX_Is&t=466.2s)]
