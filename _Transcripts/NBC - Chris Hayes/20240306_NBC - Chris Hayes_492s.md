# Ruben Gallego blasts Kari Lake She'll do 'whatever Donald Trump wants'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE)
*  In 2020, one of the crucial swing states that went for Joe Biden was not one you might have expected. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=0.0s)]
*  Arizona, the longtime conservative bastion elected Barry Goldwater to the Senate and then [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=5.2s)]
*  nominee for president and elected John McCain to the Senate six times. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=11.16s)]
*  Arizona may prove to be a pivotal state again this November, not just for Biden, but for control of the Senate. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=15.56s)]
*  Tonight, we know what the matchup will be in Arizona's key Senate race this year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=21.0s)]
*  It will be hard right Republican Kerry Lake, a bona fide Trump sickening election denier against the Democrat Congressman Ruben Gallego and Iraq war veteran. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=25.72s)]
*  There is no incumbent in the race here this year, and that is because, in case you missed this news yesterday, Kirsten Sinema, the former Democrat turned independent, who currently holds that seat, announced she's dropping out of the race and leaving the Senate at the end of her term. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=35.64s)]
*  It was the cause of jubilation of liberals everywhere, but Sinema could be replaced by something even worse. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=49.24s)]
*  Kerry Lake ran for governor in 2022 and felt just very shy of almost pulling it off. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Ruben Gallego represents much of Phoenix in Congress. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=62.2s)]
*  He's also the Democratic candidate for Senate from Arizona. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=64.48s)]
*  He joins me now. It's the first national TV interview since Senator Kirsten Sinema announced she is dropping out of the race. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=67.16s)]
*  And let's start with that, Congressman. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=73.36s)]
*  It's good to have you on the program. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=74.64s)]
*  Were you surprised by that announcement, which seemed to catch a lot of people by surprise outside of political circles or even inside political circles? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=77.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I could say I was surprised or not surprised. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=85.92s)]
*  The way that we operating this campaign from day one was that we were going to win no matter who we were running against. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=88.52s)]
*  And I operate in that manner by going out to Arizona and going to some of the hardest places to reach, talking to voters that had not been reached out to quite a while. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=95.68s)]
*  Rural Republican voters went to urban Latino voters, went to some of the hardest reaches, places to reach when it comes to Native American voters. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=107.36s)]
*  And we spoke to them about the issues they cared about every day. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  And so I had confidence that whether or not Senator Sinema ran or any other person ran, whether it was whatever Republican was, that if we took this approach, that it was going to be a winning approach. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  And I still feel that way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=129.88s)]
*  And I very much thank Senator Sinema for her career in the United States Senate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  We may not have agreed on everything when it comes to our approaches about politics, but she did great work for Arizona. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  And I look forward to working with her in the future. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  Your opponent, Carrie Lake, ran statewide two years ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=150.2s)]
*  She came very close to winning. She's a former newscaster. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  In her mind, she's still running. She sometimes declares herself the shadow governor of Arizona. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I should say that one of the things that happened in 2022, people may not recall this, is that after a number of Republicans lost races, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=165.12s)]
*  there was a question about whether anyone would attempt to pull a Trump and basically say that they were robbed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=174.04s)]
*  And really, Carrie Lake's the only one who really tried to do it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=180.56s)]
*  She tried to Trump Trump. It was very impressive. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And I think she even entered into litigation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=189.4s)]
*  Like, her position is still that she won that election, I take it? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=192.08s)]
*  She's still in litigation. She's still trying to contest a governor's race. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's actually quite ridiculous. There were two other Republicans actually won statewide on the ballot against her. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  Two other Republicans actually won more votes than she did. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=207.4s)]
*  There are Republicans that went and voted for two other statewide Republicans. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=211.52s)]
*  But they decided not to vote against her because they just did not find her an attractive candidate. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=215.08s)]
*  And yet she continues this litigation, which obviously costs the taxpayer money, but also is actually costing people some personal, you know, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=221.0s)]
*  you know, some actual personal issues. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=230.56s)]
*  You know, we have elected officials that have gotten death threats that are not running for office anymore because, you know, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  Carrie Lake continues to deny the outcomes of 2020 election to this day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=238.92s)]
*  And I say to this day, she actually just recently, actually yesterday, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=245.72s)]
*  rejected again the outcome of the 2020 election and the 2022 election in the rotunda of the Senate. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=249.88s)]
*  So this she's not moving. She's not moving. She's not changing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=257.4s)]
*  She's, you know, participating in the same election denialism that Donald Trump engaged in in 2020 and is continue to be a danger to our democracy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=262.04s)]
*  I want to ask you two specific policy questions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=271.88s)]
*  One is about legislation that actually Kirsten Sinema, the current Arizona senator, was key in negotiating, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=275.2s)]
*  which was the border legislation negotiated with Republicans that was then immediately killed by Donald Trump and Mike Johnson. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=281.24s)]
*  Would you vote for that if it did make it over to the House? Do you support that legislation? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=292.48s)]
*  When I was very public about this, as soon as the legislation came out, yes, I would support it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, we have to recognize that we are in divided government. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=302.16s)]
*  We're not going to get everything that we want. There were some good elements to that bill. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=306.44s)]
*  For example, the Afghan Resolvent Act was extremely important in that there was elements to bring in more [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=310.76s)]
*  workers through a visa program. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=319.8s)]
*  It also was really truly dealing with the issue at the border when it comes to our border communities that are very affected by our breakdown in immigration. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=322.76s)]
*  It's been happening for not just any administration, but all administrations. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=331.92s)]
*  And so there are border communities are hurting, just trying to keep up with the broken immigration system. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=335.76s)]
*  And so this is a very good response. It wasn't perfect. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  I think we have to accept that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=346.2s)]
*  But it was really indicative that, you know, Carrie Lake didn't even read the bill. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=348.44s)]
*  She actually just rejected it outright and encouraged Republicans to reject it outright because Donald Trump said to reject it, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=353.08s)]
*  not because it was a bad bill, but because it's a bad bill against their politics. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=360.64s)]
*  And so the difference between me and Carrie Lake is that I'm going to really work for Arizona solutions. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=365.36s)]
*  She is just going to work for whatever Donald Trump wants. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=372.52s)]
*  And that's not what we need in Arizona. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=375.24s)]
*  Final question for you. The president will be offering a state of the union tomorrow. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=379.4s)]
*  What are you telling Arizona voters about what an agenda you see to be part of where you to join the Senate and had a Democratic majority and Democratic president? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=383.24s)]
*  Well, number one, I think the most important thing we need to talk about is a freedom agenda. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=394.28s)]
*  Number one, freedom for women to control their bodies. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=398.32s)]
*  The fact that we are about to potentially elect a president who appointed the justices that overturned Roe v. Wade and turned back the clock when it comes to, you know, women having control over their lives. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=402.96s)]
*  Again, I think it's something that we cannot discount. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=418.88s)]
*  So that's step one. If you elect Donald Trump and Carrie Lake, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  they're going to put Supreme Court justices on that Supreme Court. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=426.68s)]
*  They're going to assure that Roe v. Wade will continue to be not the law of the land. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=430.44s)]
*  Number two, freedom, real economic freedom. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=436.2s)]
*  We have done a lot of work in this administration to bring down the cost of precision drugs, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=439.12s)]
*  to bring down the cost of insulin and continue to do other great work, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=444.4s)]
*  such as especially in Arizona, the expansion of a great economy, especially when it comes to the Chips Act. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=449.08s)]
*  Now, we're not there yet. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=454.76000000000005s)]
*  There's still a lot of costs that we have to really bring down, housing costs, costs of other things. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=457.0s)]
*  And we're going to be able to do that in this administration with me as a senator are going to work to do that for everyday Arizonans. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  OK, Congressman Ruben Gallego, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR1GpCdMLVE&t=469.32000000000005s)]
