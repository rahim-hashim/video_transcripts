# Trump will already be a ‘lame duck president on Day One,' says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, here we go. Mike Johnson has been elected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaker of the House on the first ballot with an asterisk. Technically, as a pass-fail the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=4.64s)]
*  very first round of this new MAGA era of governance, it was a pass by the barest possible margin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  But if you're grading Mike Johnson's performance today and the Republicans in general, I don't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=17.56s)]
*  think you give him an A. Now, again, on paper, this should have been straightforward pro-former [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=20.64s)]
*  That's what these traditionally have been until this era. Republicans control the House [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=26.04s)]
*  of Representatives. Donald Trump, the incoming president, gave Johnson his complete and total [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=30.28s)]
*  endorsement. And so you'd think that's that. But a group of nine House Republicans were reluctant [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=35.64s)]
*  to back Donald Trump's guy. And with Johnson working with such a narrow majority, nine's a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=41.32s)]
*  pretty big number. Now, after initially airing their dissatisfaction, six of those Republicans [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=46.28s)]
*  originally didn't even vote, right? They eventually came back into the fold. Still not enough. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=51.8s)]
*  There were three other congressmen, Thomas Massey, Kentucky, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Keith Self of Texas, who all voted for someone other than Johnson, which would doom his ability [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=61.48s)]
*  to get elected on the first ballot. It looked like Johnson was going to go down. He'd lost, basically. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=66.44s)]
*  But wanting to save face, Johnson held the vote open for an unusually long time. Instead of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=72.36s)]
*  telling the votes and moving on to the second ballot. During that time, he huddled with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Representatives Norman and Self, presumably offered them some kind of deal or cajole [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=81.8s)]
*  enticed. When Donald Trump himself got on the cell phone with the two congressmen, well then, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=86.6s)]
*  apparently things changed. According to Congressman Norman, Congresswoman Nancy Mace, remember her, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  called Trump on her cell phone from the floor of the House. Trump was, you'll be shocked to hear, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=96.44s)]
*  on the golf course of the time, told them, I'm playing golf. Mace handed her phone over to Norman. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  A conversation was had, multiple conversations in fact, and then the two congressmen changed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=107.0s)]
*  their votes to Mike Johnson, handing him on the speakership. So Johnson could technically say, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=111.48s)]
*  won on the first ballot. But again, a little shaky, hardly a resounding vote of confidence. In fact, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=116.84s)]
*  11 Republicans then signed a letter to Johnson, effectively saying they only voted for him, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=123.8s)]
*  so as not to delay the certification of the presidential votes on Monday. That happens on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=128.84s)]
*  January 6th, I don't know if you knew that, but January 6th is the day that happens, it's going [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=133.64s)]
*  to happen on Monday, and warning Mike Johnson to watch his step. Now this sends a message that it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  is not a united conference. Remember, they're talking about a whole big ambitious legislative [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=144.92s)]
*  agenda. They have not resolved any of the internal conflicts that have caused all the chaos through [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=151.0s)]
*  the last two years when they didn't really have a big agenda. Remember, they have burned through a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  speaker and a temporary speaker and finally landed on Mike Johnson. And all of this today speaks to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=161.16s)]
*  a broader question that I genuinely think is underappreciated in the post-election take-fest, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=167.64s)]
*  and it's this. How much political capital does Donald Trump have? On day one of his presidency, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=173.32s)]
*  right, January 20th, takes the oath, Donald Trump will already be a lame duck president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=181.56s)]
*  He is term-limited by the 22nd Amendment, and that isn't to say he won't do dangerous, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  reckless, destructive things, or maybe even try some cockamamie scheme to stay in office. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  It's not to say he doesn't control the Republican Party, he very much does, right? But it's also true [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  that with every passing the day, the way this works is he sheds a little more of his political [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=202.2s)]
*  capital. I think arguably that it was at its highest point around, you know, two in the morning, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=206.92s)]
*  the day after the election, right? Right after, right after he pulled off, I would say, truly, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=214.6s)]
*  the most improbable political comeback in American history. And right shortly thereafter, Republicans [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=219.96s)]
*  are saying things like this. There's no question he's the leader of our party. So now he's got a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=225.96s)]
*  mission statement, his mission, and his goals and objectives, whatever that is, we need to embrace it, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=230.84s)]
*  all of it. Every single word in his mission statement. If Donald Trump says, jump three feet [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=236.76s)]
*  high and scratch your head, we all jump three feet high and scratch your heads. That's it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=243.0s)]
*  Sort of a kind of beta approach to life, but you do you. But things move fast in Washington. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=248.84s)]
*  Two weeks ago, you had this big shutdown fight where Elon Musk rushed in, remember, and he took [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=255.48s)]
*  the lead. There was a kind of vacuum, right? It was just going to go along and then Musk went crazy [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=259.8s)]
*  on it. Again, he was the initiator. He was the source of energy and he had a demand. And his demand, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=263.96s)]
*  remember, this is a few weeks ago, right, was to cut spending from this government funding bill and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=269.72s)]
*  to pare it down. And then Donald Trump, not wanting to be upstaged, he rushed in with his demand, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=274.6s)]
*  right? And he asked Republicans, in fact, demanded, in fact, instructed them with a threat of a primary [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=281.72s)]
*  that they had to take care of the debt ceiling or he would primary anyone who doesn't. And so what [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=287.48s)]
*  happened then? Remember, Republicans listened to Musk and not to Trump. They did cut the size of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=292.44000000000005s)]
*  the bill to keep the government open. They shed a bunch of stuff. They did nothing on the debt ceiling. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=299.32s)]
*  And as far as we can tell, Trump was just like, okay, fine. Now, over in the Senate, things aren't [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=305.4s)]
*  looking like completely rosy either. Remember that Senator Rick Scott of Florida lost the vote to be [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=310.92s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader. He was running for that position for a while. And you might remember, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=317.4s)]
*  he was the one who said that the Senate would roll over, should roll over, should entirely give [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=321.56s)]
*  up its role to advise and consent on cabinet picks. Right now, it doesn't look like that initial [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=326.84s)]
*  plan is going to happen. That was the big thing they all said, right? This sort of shock and awe [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=332.2s)]
*  announcement. They're going to just recess them and appoint everyone. And again, speaking of Trump's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=336.11999999999995s)]
*  cabinet picks, which are sort of early tests of political capital, he's already had two of them [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  go down before the year even turned over, right? Before the confirmation process even began. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  The Republican Senate refused to really even entertain the idea of Matt Gaetz serving as Attorney General of the United States. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=350.52s)]
*  And, you know, who could blame them? Trump's pick to run the DEA, Florida Sheriff Chad Conister, had to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=358.68s)]
*  withdraw from consideration after just three days, apparently because the Republican base thought he had [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=364.52s)]
*  been too strict about COVID restrictions back in 2020. All of which is to say, again, maybe Donald [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=368.84s)]
*  Trump is not quite as politically strong as he wants you to believe. Again, there's context, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  there's history here. Lame duck presidents historically have struggled to push through bold [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=382.11999999999995s)]
*  agendas. Here's what George W. Bush famously said just days after he won reelection 2004, when he was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=386.44s)]
*  sort of at his peak as well. And it's the first time a Republican won the popular vote since his dad's win [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=393.32s)]
*  in 1988. I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  It is my style. That's what happened after the 2000 election. I earned some capital. I've earned [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=406.44s)]
*  capital in this election and I'm going to spend it for what I told the people I'd spend it on, which [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=412.6s)]
*  is, you've heard the agenda, Social Security and tax reform. Oh yeah, the agenda. Tax reform, meaning [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  enormous tax cuts for rich people and privatizing Social Security. That was the big bold agenda. He [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  was going to use his political capital to privatize Social Security. Privately, Bush was telling his [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=429.24s)]
*  allies this, quote, we have to move quickly because after that I'll be quacking like a duck. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=433.56s)]
*  Right? He understood the longer time goes on, the more the political capital drains out of you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=440.6s)]
*  And he wasn't able to privatize Social Security, large part because Democrats united against it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=445.64s)]
*  His party then got shellacked in the 2006 midterms. And then remember this thing called the global [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=450.2s)]
*  financial crisis happened under his watch. He was historically unpopular, his approval rating [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  dropping to just 25% during the 2008 election. Again, the past is not prologue. Things may go [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=460.52s)]
*  completely differently this time around, but this is just the last time that we had a second term [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=468.12s)]
*  Republican who was a lame duck, quacking like a duck, as he said. Now Trump's situation is [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=473.24s)]
*  genuinely unprecedented. Remember, we haven't been here before in the country's history. He is the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  first president since the introduction of constitutional term limits to serve a second [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=485.88s)]
*  non-consecutive term. So again, we got no idea how things are going to unfold. There isn't really a [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=491.32s)]
*  playbook. Like Bush in 2004, Republicans have a big agenda. Weirdly enough, it involves huge [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=496.28s)]
*  tax cuts for corporations and rich people, maybe going after Social Security, Medicare, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=503.08s)]
*  Medicaid. Some things never change. The Republican party has political power. There's no question [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=507.24s)]
*  about that. They won this election. No question about that. But the question of just how [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=511.8s)]
*  large that power is, how absolute, how disciplined they will all be, how long it will last, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=520.04s)]
*  all of that is very much an open question. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evG7WB7I5WU&t=526.28s)]
