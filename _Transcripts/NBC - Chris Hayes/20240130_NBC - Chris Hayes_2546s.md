# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 30  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  These strikes are mostly hurting the tax in the past. What will be the difference? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=3.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=8.0s)]
*  The president says an American response is coming. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=9.0s)]
*  The president's been crystal clear. We will respond decisively. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Tonight, what we know about the Biden decision and his dangerous moment on the global stage. Ben. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=17.0s)]
*  He's nothing. We don't need to be afraid of him. He can be knocked down. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=23.0s)]
*  After E. Jean Carroll, awaiting a Trump ink verdict and how the courts can make Trump pay. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=29.0s)]
*  Plus, everything you need to know about the bad faith border mess. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=35.0s)]
*  It has always been about helping Donald Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=40.0s)]
*  And Michael Isikoff with exclusive new reporting on the secret recording of Trump's attempt to steal Georgia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=43.0s)]
*  Tell us. I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=50.0s)]
*  All In starts right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=54.0s)]
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=60.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden says he has made his decision on how the U.S. will respond to the deaths of three American soldiers in the Middle East. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Retaliation escalation look increasingly likely. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Those three army reservists were killed and more than 30 of their comrades were injured over the weekend in a drone attack on their logistics base in northeast Jordan right near the Syrian border. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=73.0s)]
*  The dead include Sergeant William Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Sanders, 24, and Specialist Brianna Moffat, who was just 23. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=84.0s)]
*  The army announcing today that Sanders and Moffat would be promoted posthumously. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=93.0s)]
*  The three were killed, according to President Biden, by an unmanned aerial attack from, quote, Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=98.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=107.0s)]
*  I do hold them responsible to find the weapons to the people who did it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Iran has issued a statement denying any tie to the attack. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=125.0s)]
*  Its foreign minister said his country was not involved in the decision making of militant groups, like the one that did claim responsibility for the attack, known as the Islamic resistance in Iraq. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Saturday's fatal attack was the latest in a series of escalatory strikes and counter strikes throughout the region following the October 7th Hamas attacks in southern Israel and Israel's overwhelming military response. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=138.0s)]
*  There's a sense in which the way things have played out appears to follow Hamas's plan, which was to commit an act of violence so outrageous it would evoke a massive reaction from Israel that could engulf the entire region. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=152.0s)]
*  Remember back in the end of November when the New York Times reported on the intelligence failures in the lead up to October 7th, it cited the emails of a veteran Israeli analyst who had tracked Hamas's preparations. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=165.0s)]
*  She told her bosses, quote, It is a plan designed to start a war. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=176.0s)]
*  It's not just a raid on a village. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=180.0s)]
*  Despite those warnings, Hamas was able to pull off the horrific attack. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=182.0s)]
*  The left some 1200 Israelis dead and over 120 hostages still to this day in Hamas custody. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=186.0s)]
*  In response, Israel launched first airstrikes on Gaza, pursued a devastating ground invasion that has now gone on for more than 100 days. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=192.0s)]
*  Those operations have killed nearly 27,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, at least 16,000 of which are women and children, according to the UN. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=199.0s)]
*  UN also says 1.7 million people have been displaced, more than three quarters of the entire population, of the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Almost half of all buildings and homes in Gaza have been completely destroyed, according to the World Bank. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=216.0s)]
*  It's worth noting more than 100 days into this, that the only moment in this entire conflict where lives were saved and hostages were returned safely to their families was during the week long pause back in November, the cessation of hostilities. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=223.0s)]
*  There have been, over the last week or so, we know, talks of another possible pause and hostage deal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=237.0s)]
*  Hamas is demanding a broader agreement on the future of Gaza. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=243.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rejecting demands that Israel withdraw from Gaza and release thousands of Palestinian detainees. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=247.0s)]
*  But if the strategic aim of Hamas was, among other aims, to start a regional conflict, to put the Palestinian cause back at the center of the politics of the whole region, then it seems that every day they're having more and more success in that respect. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=255.0s)]
*  There have been exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=269.0s)]
*  Houthi rebels in Yemen have been seizing ships in the Red Sea, they say, to protest the continued Israeli military assault on Gaza. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=272.0s)]
*  Militia groups in Iraq and Syria have attacked Americans still stationed there, and now this fatal strike on American troops in Jordan over the weekend. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=279.0s)]
*  The U.S. for its part has been hitting multiple targets. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=287.0s)]
*  Houthi targets in Yemen, as well as targets in Iraq, where the remaining American presence is increasingly drawing protests in the Iraqi government. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Many of the militias and proxies fueling this violence are, as President Biden says, funded by Iran, although it was much harder to say whether in any given attack those proxies were acting on their own or with Iranian coordination. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=299.0s)]
*  What is clear is that throughout the region there are now many different players exchanging blows, and an escalatory logic is kicking in, a logic taking hold not just among generals in the Pentagon, but among diplomats in the State Department. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=311.0s)]
*  What we do know is that Iran-backed militias are responsible for these continued attacks on U.S. forces, and that we will respond at a time and manner of our choosing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=324.0s)]
*  We will respond. We will respond strongly. We will respond at a time and place of our choosing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=333.0s)]
*  I've been talking to U.S. policymakers since the aftermath of October 7th, and one of the things they've been saying is they don't want a wider Middle East conflict. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=340.0s)]
*  They say this. They're working hard to avoid it. Well, today, a wider Middle East conflict could destroy the extremely tenuous peace in Yemen that took five years of diplomacy to achieve. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=349.0s)]
*  Countless more lives would be threatened on top of those who have already died. The price of oil would likely spike, create enormous political blowback not just over there, but here in the U.S., a country already exhausted by years of war. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=359.0s)]
*  President Biden, to his credit, his enduring credit, ended the longest of those wars with the withdrawal from Afghanistan two and a half years ago. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=371.0s)]
*  He got enormous amounts of criticism. It hurt his approval rating. He has largely resisted the loudest voices pushing for escalation against Iran as the administration has sought a renewed Iranian nuclear deal, the one that was torn up by Donald Trump. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=379.0s)]
*  But those voices pushing for war with Iran escalation have grown even louder since last weekend's attack. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=395.0s)]
*  Quote, hit Iran now, hit them hard. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham posted to social media as the very first reports came in from Jordan. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=404.0s)]
*  In case that wasn't clear enough, his Republican colleague, Senator John Cornyn, posted quote, target Tehran. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=409.0s)]
*  I don't know if he meant that as like a stand-in for the Iranian regime or like the actual city. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=414.0s)]
*  The looming threat now is a familiar kind of one dimensional U.S. logic for Middle Eastern intervention, which is to use military force to achieve your goals. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=419.0s)]
*  And when that doesn't work, just use more force. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=429.0s)]
*  It's a pathway now appear to be moving down. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=433.0s)]
*  And after 20 years of covering it, I personally find it very hard to see that pathway to anything good. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=436.0s)]
*  Spencer Ackerman is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and foreign policy columnist for the nation. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=443.0s)]
*  He publishes the newsletter Forever Wars where he writes about the war on terror. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=447.0s)]
*  He wrote a fantastic history of the war on terror and has been covering this aspect of the conflict very closely. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=451.0s)]
*  Who in Majd is an author, Iran expert and NBC News contributor who's extensively covered U.S.-Iranian relations. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=455.0s)]
*  And they both join me now. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=461.0s)]
*  So I just one of the things that happens here, particularly with U.S. involvement in the Middle East, is it's like this stuff is happening over there and there's not a ton of coverage. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=463.0s)]
*  There's a lot of reporters doing very good work, but it doesn't penetrate American consciousness. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=472.0s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, so Americans got killed. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=476.0s)]
*  That's horrible. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=478.0s)]
*  Or we're striking someone. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=479.0s)]
*  It's like, wait, what? Who? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=481.0s)]
*  So like, just to start, you've been doing really good reporting on this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=483.0s)]
*  We've talked a bit about the Houthis. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=487.0s)]
*  But when we talk about Iran-backed militants that are in Iraq and Syria, like who are these groups? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=488.0s)]
*  What are they? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=494.0s)]
*  So without getting bogged down in the weeds too much, Iran doesn't exercise military command and control, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=495.0s)]
*  issuing orders that then those different groups escalate. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=503.0s)]
*  However, all of these different groups have sprouted up as part of an Iranian project of power projection and regional influence throughout the region. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=507.0s)]
*  Usually they have gotten stronger in response to the cascading generation-long missteps of U.S. foreign policy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=516.0s)]
*  And now you can see this on display in the Middle East right now. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=525.0s)]
*  We are past the point. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=529.0s)]
*  Whatever the questions of firm command and control from Iran are, and I think they're kind of red herrings here, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=531.0s)]
*  the reality of the Middle East conflagration is such that we can no longer talk about a regional war down the road. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=537.0s)]
*  This is it right now. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=544.0s)]
*  Only active American diplomacy can stop it before it becomes apocalyptic. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=546.0s)]
*  There is this sort of very finely calibrated bilateral relationship with the U.S. and Iran, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=553.0s)]
*  I mean, understating things, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=559.0s)]
*  These are nations that have no formal diplomatic channels, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=562.0s)]
*  Ever since the kidnapping, the hostage crisis. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=565.0s)]
*  These are countries that have met on the battlefield in many different ways, often through proxies. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=569.0s)]
*  The Trump administration assassinated the top leader of the Iranian Republican Guard and tore up that deal. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=574.0s)]
*  They're also, though, both acutely aware of the stakes of an outright conflict. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=582.0s)]
*  How do you judge the sort of calculations being made in Iranian foreign policy circles right now? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=590.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think Iran, I would agree that Iran doesn't really want a direct conflict with, you know, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=597.0s)]
*  F-16s flying over Tehran, killing Iranian citizens. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=603.0s)]
*  But it also doesn't want to appear weak. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=607.0s)]
*  And, you know, it has to... [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=612.0s)]
*  You just enunciated the logic for all of this, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=614.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=616.0s)]
*  So it is going to, if we, if the United States attacks Iran directly, I mean, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=617.0s)]
*  the senators and the congresspeople who are saying, you know, hit Iran, it's the most reckless kind of language [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=623.0s)]
*  because you're going to get the rest of the country, rah, rah, rah, they killed Americans, let's go kill some Iranians. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=630.0s)]
*  Well, you know, the Iranians will have to respond. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=635.0s)]
*  They will have to respond. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=638.0s)]
*  The regime's survival will depend on a response. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=639.0s)]
*  And that response will mean continuing conflict because, as Spencer just pointed out, it just escalates. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=642.0s)]
*  Then, you know, then you become, have a real war going on. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=649.0s)]
*  And that's just not something that's in the interest of the United States. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=652.0s)]
*  And diplomacy has... [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=655.0s)]
*  Absolutely not in the interest of Iran, although I would argue that it's actually less in the interest of the United States than it is for Iran. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=656.0s)]
*  Iran will be able to activate Hezbollah, which it has not yet done, because if there's any group that Iran could potentially activate, it's Hezbollah. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=663.0s)]
*  And this is a key sort of shoe that hasn't dropped. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=673.0s)]
*  So after the Hamas attacks and the Israeli response, the head of Hezbollah, Nasrallah, gave a big speech. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=675.0s)]
*  And there was an enormous... [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=681.0s)]
*  It was like the Fed chair speaking. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=682.0s)]
*  There's an enormous sort of like, what's he going to say? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=684.0s)]
*  What's he going to do? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=686.0s)]
*  Everyone reading very carefully. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=687.0s)]
*  And it was in the grand scheme of things, a kind of like, we support Hamas, we support resistance to the Israelis. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=688.0s)]
*  We're not doing anything yet. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=695.0s)]
*  How does that factor in here? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=698.0s)]
*  And in fact, Nasrallah has done this twice after the assassination of both the Hamas official in Beirut and the IRGC official in Syria as well. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=701.0s)]
*  Hezbollah is a force really to fear here. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=712.0s)]
*  The last time the IDF fought Hezbollah, Hezbollah functionally won, and it created a crisis of confidence within the IDF. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=714.0s)]
*  This is back in 2006. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=721.0s)]
*  In 2006. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=722.0s)]
*  And again, Hezbollah is both a more battle-hardened force because of its role in the Syrian civil war and also its missile arsenal has vastly increased. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=723.0s)]
*  What we should look at from the map that you just put on television is all of the different places that Iran's coalition, not just Iran itself, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=732.0s)]
*  but all of these different forces can inflict massive consequences and costs beyond what they've already done. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=742.0s)]
*  The war won't be in the place where the United States wishes the war to be. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=750.0s)]
*  It will be all over the Middle East, even beyond what we are seeing right now. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=755.0s)]
*  And I think what Spencer said at the beginning is absolutely correct. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=760.0s)]
*  I mean, this is calling for diplomacy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=765.0s)]
*  It's begging for diplomacy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=768.0s)]
*  And it doesn't appear that there is very much of that. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=770.0s)]
*  When you have your Secretary of State saying, well, we're going to attack, basically at the time of our choosing, not saying we're going to attack. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=772.0s)]
*  But implying that there's going to be an attack of some kind. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=779.0s)]
*  If they attack, if the United States attacks Hezbollah, the perpetrators of this drone attack, maybe they can then engage in diplomacy. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=783.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=793.0s)]
*  But I think that the minute you start killing Iraqis, you're going to also have trouble. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=794.0s)]
*  Well, and I want to get to that in a second. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=799.0s)]
*  But there is this one channel, right? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=800.0s)]
*  So there's been this sort of Qatari channel throughout the whole crisis. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=802.0s)]
*  That's the Qatari's as a sort of central mediator between Israel and Hamas, but also US and Europe. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=806.0s)]
*  And Iran. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=812.0s)]
*  And Iran. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=813.0s)]
*  Director of CIA, William Burns, traveling to an undisclosed location to throw his weight behind a possible hostage. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=814.0s)]
*  So there's that channel. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=820.0s)]
*  I guess the question is, are there talks happening at the US to Iran level? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=821.0s)]
*  Are there like, is there other diplomatic talks other than that channel? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=826.0s)]
*  If there are, I don't know about them. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=829.0s)]
*  And the issue right now is that we are running out of time to avert total disaster. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=831.0s)]
*  This has to be an actual about face by Biden. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=837.0s)]
*  He has to make a critical choice not just to deescalate with Iran, but to restrain Israel, whose conflict the ICJ, the International Court of Justice, has called plausibly genocidal. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=840.0s)]
*  The numbers of both displaced and dead have now exceeded those of the 1948 Nakba. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=853.0s)]
*  All of this goes away. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=859.0s)]
*  All of this regional conflict goes away if the United States can use its overwhelming leverage on Israel to stop it right now. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=862.0s)]
*  If they are able to pivot this away from Burns and everyone else's work to get a ceasefire for hostage release, that is a crucial opportunity to seize. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=871.0s)]
*  It seems to me that the ceasefire, I mean, you can't have a ceasefire unless both parties agree to it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=880.0s)]
*  That's the nature of a cease party. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=885.0s)]
*  And it's unclear whether, again, there are incentives for Hamas to continue. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=886.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=890.0s)]
*  It's on the table right now. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=891.0s)]
*  They haven't decided yet. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=892.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=893.0s)]
*  But it does seem to me that the core of this is the first domino, right, is October 7th and the response to it and what that's done in the region. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=894.0s)]
*  What you're saying, and I'm curious what you think, is that like were there to be a ceasefire tomorrow, how much that itself would essentially lower the temperature? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=902.0s)]
*  Well, I think it would lower its temperature quite a bit. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=909.0s)]
*  The Houthis have already said they're going to stop attacking. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=910.0s)]
*  I mean, they're asking for a ceasefire. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=912.0s)]
*  They're saying that's the reason we're attacking these ships in the Red Sea. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=914.0s)]
*  So that automatically stops. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=917.0s)]
*  And it stopped before when there was a pause in the fighting. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=919.0s)]
*  And I think it just de-escalates. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=923.0s)]
*  The tension comes way down. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=925.0s)]
*  Obviously, Hezbollah will feel more confident that they're not going to get involved in a war. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=926.0s)]
*  But what I think what's interesting about Burns, which Spencer mentioned, Burns is probably one of the few American politicians or in the leadership who are going to be involved in a war. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=932.0s)]
*  Hezbollah is one of the few American politicians or in the leadership who has had direct relations, negotiations with Iran. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=943.0s)]
*  In fact, was involved in the JCPOA, the nuclear deal, was involved prior to that when they even were talking about a nuclear deal, was going to Doha, not Doha, sorry, Oman. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=949.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, he's not at the State Department now. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=959.0s)]
*  He's the CIA director. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=963.0s)]
*  It makes it much more difficult for the Iranians to engage with him even secretly. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=964.0s)]
*  As a diplomat, very prescient. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=970.0s)]
*  One of the only people to have called in the US government, the Bush administration, the Iraq war correctly. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=973.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=977.0s)]
*  So yes. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=978.0s)]
*  I mean, again, so much hangs on that channel, which we continue to watch every day. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=979.0s)]
*  Spencer Ackerman, Hohenmaaj. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=983.0s)]
*  That was really, really enlightening and very, very helpful. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=984.0s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=986.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=987.0s)]
*  Coming up, Donald Trump starts digging in his couch cushions to come up with the $83 million that he owes writer Eugene Carroll. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=988.0s)]
*  But first, the Republican fan plan to refuse to fix the border and to blame Democrats when it all goes wrong. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=996.0s)]
*  Next. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1002.0s)]
*  One month into the election year, Republicans are down to basically one issue, really one issue they are confident about politically. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1005.0s)]
*  They often refer to it as the crisis at the southern border. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  But while they are trying everything possible to raise the salience of the border issue and are having some success, what they are not doing and in fact, is intention with that goal is anything to try to solve it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  That is because they don't want to improve the situation. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  They want it bad. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has almost explicitly said that he preferred to let the crisis continue, in fact, to make the crisis worse so he can then attack President Joe Biden on the campaign trail. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1030.0s)]
*  Now, the enduring truth about the border and immigration is that it is easy to sloganeer about, but extremely complicated and difficult to actually legislate or administer. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1053.0s)]
*  Reach way back in your memory. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1055.0s)]
*  Donald Trump launching his campaign on a promise to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1057.0s)]
*  He didn't do either. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1064.0s)]
*  He replaced some fences and of course, US footed the bill. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1065.0s)]
*  And all the while, in the early years, the Trump administration, guess what? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1068.0s)]
*  People kept showing up at the southern border, even though he said he was going to stop that. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1073.0s)]
*  At one point, Trump and his advisor Stephen Miller concocted an utterly depraved campaign to essentially kidnap the children of migrants when they cross in the US. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  And yet, and yet people still kept coming. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  Now, with border crossings at all time highs, Trump and Republicans are being offered actual legislative solutions negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators and supported quite explicitly by President Biden and his administration, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1089.0s)]
*  including being supported by some of the most conservative senators in the Senate. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1103.0s)]
*  Trump's response and House Republicans response on their one best issue is to destroy the deal. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1107.0s)]
*  They want to sink the deal and then they're going to try to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1114.0s)]
*  Extreme mega Republicans who are running the House of Representatives are deeply unserious people. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1121.0s)]
*  They don't want progress. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1128.0s)]
*  They don't want solutions. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  They want a political issue. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  And most of all, they want to please their disgraced former president. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1134.0s)]
*  House Republicans take their march in orders from Donald Trump. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1140.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett is a Democrat of Texas. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1145.0s)]
*  She previously served as a Texas state representative, knows the state well, and she joins me now. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, this was the goal, I think, today is our headlines. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1153.0s)]
*  The goal is to keep the border and immigration in the public mind because they think they have an advantage on that issue. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  So every day they can do that as a win. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1165.0s)]
*  But it's a serious thing to impeach someone. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1167.0s)]
*  Were you at all persuaded by whatever case they were laying out today? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1170.0s)]
*  Of course, you know, I wasn't persuaded. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  You know, I may be new to this body, but I am definitely not new to the antics when it comes to the Republican Party. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1178.0s)]
*  And so we know what they are trying to do. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1187.0s)]
*  And they're actually doing a semi-good job of diminishing how big of a deal it is for someone to be impeached. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1190.0s)]
*  And that's what they want to do, because their frontrunner, their leader, their cult leader, he has been impeached twice. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  And they basically want to water it down and make it seem as if an impeachment is something that you can get from Oprah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1204.0s)]
*  Everybody can get one. You can get one. You can get one and things like that. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1210.0s)]
*  And so that's what they're trying to do with this mayorkas impeachment. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1213.0s)]
*  And it's wrong because it tells you, just like the chairman just said, how deeply unserious these people are when it comes to running this country. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1216.0s)]
*  And this is a complicated issue. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  And one of the things that most people haven't really touched on is the fact that, yeah, we have the separation of the children at the border. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  But do we remember that that actually cost us money? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1236.0s)]
*  Do we recall that there were settlements that had to be paid out? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1240.0s)]
*  Listen, Trump didn't do anything to help us or he didn't handle immigration in any great way at all. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think I just want to sort of you made this point about sort of watering down the importance of impeachment. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1252.0s)]
*  It strikes me as pretty important here. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  So there's this is literally only happened once in the history of the country, which is really saying something that a cabinet secretary, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1260.0s)]
*  This is in New York Times from March 3rd of 1876, General Belknap to be impeached. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1268.0s)]
*  Full report of the testimony affecting the ex secretary of the proceedings of the Congress there on. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1275.0s)]
*  And he actually resigned in the impeachment. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1280.0s)]
*  Anyway, I should say that in that case, Belknap, there was basically an enormous pay to play scandal and kickback scheme that had been uncovered. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1282.0s)]
*  Forty witnesses testified to it in which he was essentially handing out government favors in exchange for cash. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1289.0s)]
*  It was wildly and flagrantly corrupt. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1295.0s)]
*  That's the standard. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1297.0s)]
*  They don't like my orcas. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1301.0s)]
*  They don't like the Biden administration policy, which is their right. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1303.0s)]
*  It's a free country. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1305.0s)]
*  But what's the like? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1306.0s)]
*  It's been more than 100 years and it was an enormous corruption scheme. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1309.0s)]
*  What is the high crime or misdemeanor? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1313.0s)]
*  I mean, we know that one doesn't exist, right? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1316.0s)]
*  It's just like the fact that they want to go after the president and they have nothing to offer. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1318.0s)]
*  They're doing everything that they can because they really want to get an impeachment under their belt so that Trump can go ahead and say, you see, when the Democrats did it, it didn't mean anything. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1323.0s)]
*  That's why I wasn't convicted. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1334.0s)]
*  That's why these 91 counts, they don't matter. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1336.0s)]
*  It's all a weaponization. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1339.0s)]
*  Well, I've got news for you. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1341.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, just like the general that you just talked about, is corrupt. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1342.0s)]
*  Bottom line, bottom line. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1347.0s)]
*  And honestly, if New York keeps going the way that it's going, he's going to be broke and corrupt at the end of the day. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1349.0s)]
*  Like, we need to make sure. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1355.0s)]
*  You know, I think that this country works better when we have a real two party system. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1357.0s)]
*  I will be perfectly honest. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  And I want serious people that I can work with across the aisle. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1363.0s)]
*  I want to move this country forward in a responsible way. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1367.0s)]
*  I can tell you that the average Democrat wants just that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1371.0s)]
*  I have been working with my senior senator on bills who is a Republican from the state of Texas. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  We can do this, but we've got to stop electing these clowns, these people that are doing nothing but tearing us apart from within. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1380.0s)]
*  And we've got to get people that actually believe in the Constitution instead of saying they believe in it, but actually showing us that they believe in the Constitution and the sanctity of the positions that we hold and the institution overall. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1388.0s)]
*  Yeah, to your point, I just will will repoint out that over months of bipartisan negotiations in the Senate, the contours of a budget deal were hammered out. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1402.0s)]
*  A border deal were hammered out. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1411.0s)]
*  It's been endorsed by the president. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1413.0s)]
*  It's been endorsed by the Republican senators who negotiated, including Senator Lankford, who is quite conservative. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1414.0s)]
*  Tom Tillis, they've said it's the most conservative bill we're going to get on the border in generations. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1419.0s)]
*  And House Speaker Mike Johnson and Donald Trump want to kill it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1425.0s)]
*  So that's where we stand right now. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  We'll see if that changes. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1430.0s)]
*  We will have you back, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, if it does. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1431.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1433.0s)]
*  Have a good one. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  Still ahead, author Michael Isikoff on the inside story of Donald Trump's quest to find 11,000 votes in Georgia. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1435.0s)]
*  But first, Donald Trump's legal troubles start to hurt the thing he cares most about in the entire world, his bank account. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  Just how will the quadruply indicted ex-president handle his rapidly accumulating legal debts? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1449.0s)]
*  Next. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump is now on the clock after a jury ordered him to pay over $83 million to E. Jean Carroll, the woman that a jury found he had sexually abused and then subsequently defamed and then kept defaming. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1461.0s)]
*  Once that judgment has been filed, he'll have just 30 days to either fork over the cash or to post some kind of bond in order to file an appeal. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1472.0s)]
*  Now, the appeals process can be tricky. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1480.0s)]
*  So Trump is trying other ways to wriggle out of the judgment, including a ridiculous, we've come to expect this, Hail Mary from his lawyer, Alina Haba. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  She just tried to intimate some kind of conflict of interest between the judge and Carroll's lawyer, Robby Kaplan, because they briefly, like for two years, they worked at the same law firm 30 years ago. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1489.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1500.0s)]
*  After Kaplan shot down that, frankly, ludicrous claim and warned she could seek sanctions, Haba immediately backed off. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  Of course, in the end, money matters more to Donald Trump than just about anything, and he's in a real financial pickle right now. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1509.0s)]
*  He's not just facing the $83 million judgment for defaming E. Jean Carroll. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1515.0s)]
*  The New York attorney general is asking for four times that much in his civil fraud trial. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1519.0s)]
*  The decision on that is expected basically any day now and could leave Trump out of pocket and out of business. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1523.0s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal analyst who's been in the courtroom for many of Trump's trials. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1529.0s)]
*  Timodayo Algonco Williams, a former federal prosecutor who served as senior investigative counsel to the January 6th Committee. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1541.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1542.0s)]
*  Let me just start on this. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  They're trying to get a new trial, Trump's lawyers? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1544.0s)]
*  They've insinuated that they're going to file a motion for a new trial. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  That's even in the letter where they've conceded that there actually isn't a problem between the two Kaplans. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1551.0s)]
*  They drop a footnote saying, of course, we're going to address this bias problem that the judge has with us in our post-trial motions, including potentially under Rule 59. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1557.0s)]
*  Rule 59 is the shorthand for a motion for a new trial. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1567.0s)]
*  And Chris, I want to point out to you and our viewers. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1570.0s)]
*  They've tried a lot of these kind of wacky things so far. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1572.0s)]
*  They've asked for a recusal of Judge Kaplan on the basis of his relationship with another of Eugene Carroll's lawyers. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1575.0s)]
*  They asked for a mistrial after Eugene Carroll admitted to deleting death threats against her. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  So this is the third time they've tried for a do-over or cutting it short based on bias or alleged improprieties because they know that they don't have real substantive grounds for an appeal. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  Now, in terms of substantive grounds for appeal, I was looking into this and talking to some lawyers. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1597.0s)]
*  It's not like appealing a federal jury award is not very easy. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1602.0s)]
*  No, it's not. And partly because the question before that's going to appeal is going to be really about the law. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1607.0s)]
*  The factual question of sexual assault was handled in a separate trial. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1614.0s)]
*  They cannot, appealing this judgment, then try to relitigate that point. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1618.0s)]
*  That was the issue on the trial record here. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1622.0s)]
*  So the factual record is pretty set. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1624.0s)]
*  So what's going to be happening is they're going to be challenging legal conclusions here, perhaps evidentiary or something otherwise. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1626.0s)]
*  Again, very limited. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1632.0s)]
*  Or they're going to be saying that the judge erred in finding, as we presume he will, that this was a reasonable civil judgment here, which is what they're going to do after the Rule 59 motion. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  They'll try to get that verdict amended. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1643.0s)]
*  Judge Kaplan is going to reject that, and they'll take that up to the Second Circuit. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1645.0s)]
*  But I think important here, the Second Circuit, the appellate court, is going to look at Judge Kaplan with very favorable eyes. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  He's a very well-respected judge in Southern District, and that's one of the most, if not the most respected court in the country. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1655.0s)]
*  So it's really an uphill battle here. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1661.0s)]
*  I mean, again, it's one of these things where every day that you can avoid paying the piper is the day you win. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1663.0s)]
*  And that's basically the way they've been operating throughout this entire thing. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  We should also note, Lisa, like part of this is he spent 50 million. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1672.0s)]
*  This is what we got. His super PAC spent 50 million on legal expenses in 2023. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1676.0s)]
*  On legal bills, investigation related expenses last year, according to two people, pretty fairly figure. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1682.0s)]
*  But again, spent 50 million. He just raised it all. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  That's right. And we're going to find out tomorrow. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1689.0s)]
*  It's like if you go out to dinner, it's like, well, that's an extravagant dinner. Someone else pays for it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1691.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you know what? File that other motion. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1694.0s)]
*  What's it going to cost? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1697.0s)]
*  Chris, tomorrow is the FEC's deadline for PACs to make their filing for the second half of 2023. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1700.0s)]
*  So while the New York Times has reported that overall through two PACs, he paid 50 million dollars in legal fees. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1706.0s)]
*  Tomorrow we get that nitty gritty, right? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1712.0s)]
*  We find out who he paid and what increments. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1714.0s)]
*  And most of the law firms that represent him are not big law firms that could have handled multiple matters. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1717.0s)]
*  There are places like Habba Mideo, which represented him in the Carroll case, or Continental PLLC. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1722.0s)]
*  That's Chris Kise's firm. Chris Kise represents him, obviously, in this New York attorney general's case. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1727.0s)]
*  So it'll be pretty easy for people like us to connect those dots and figure out just exactly what those small dollar donors have been paying for. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1731.0s)]
*  And of course, everybody who donates to Trump campaign, 10 percent of that goes to Save America 2. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1738.0s)]
*  Right. I forgot they were doing that. That's amazing. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1744.0s)]
*  It's a little 10 percent just like off the top shuttle payment. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  So then we got we are also obviously we're awaiting the immunity decision by the D.C. circuit. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1751.0s)]
*  I'm just you know, watch pot never boils. I'm just putting it over here. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1756.0s)]
*  Back on the back burner. I'm not looking at that anymore. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1759.0s)]
*  There's Judge Ungorn is going to enter some sort of finding right in the New York Civil Trial. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1763.0s)]
*  And he's basically going to tell us like what did the did the plaintiffs meet their burden and also how much money. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1769.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, he's going to give us the number right to James offices. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1776.0s)]
*  So the court's going to ask for 370 million, but we're also going to learn whether the defendants, namely the former president, are going to be able to continue to operate a business in New York state or whether they're going to get what's been called the corporate death penalty. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1781.0s)]
*  That's also a big possibility here. So we'll be looking for the number and Trump's future as a businessman in this state. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1793.0s)]
*  And with like let's say it's 350 million dollars again. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1800.0s)]
*  We don't really know his finances. They're a little opaque. But like even people with a lot of money like 83 and 350, you know, that's pretty quick. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1804.0s)]
*  That's four to thirty three. That's a lot of it's a lot of millions. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1812.0s)]
*  And it's an excessive what most people think he has on hand. Even if you take him at his word. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1817.0s)]
*  Remember in that New York attorney general deposition that was played at the Carroll trial, he says, I have 400 million dollars in cash on hand. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1821.0s)]
*  I assume that's already a massive exaggeration. There are people who have expressed concern anonymously to other reporters that he can't even pay E.G. Carroll's verdict. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1829.0s)]
*  Right. Right. So it's going to be interesting to see how it all works. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1838.0s)]
*  All right. Lisa Rubin, Timmy Diagon, Go Williams. Great to have you both here. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1841.0s)]
*  Thank you. Still to come. I just want to find 11,780 votes. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1844.0s)]
*  The full story of Donald Trump's infamous attempt to steal Georgia's electoral votes with author Michael Isikoff. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1849.0s)]
*  So Donald Trump spent a staggering 50 million dollars on legal fees last year's alone, according to New York New reporting from the New York Times. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1860.0s)]
*  It turns out that facing four criminal trials with 91 felony counts, plus a couple of high profile civil suits is pretty expensive. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1868.0s)]
*  The ex president has a very clear strategy for his many legal headaches to delay and delay and delay some more delay until the election so he can win back the White House and declare himself a vote. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1877.0s)]
*  We are, as I just noted, still awaiting a decision from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on the question of whether Donald Trump effectively has complete immunity from criminal prosecution for just about anything he did while president. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1889.0s)]
*  As his lawyers argued in court, that immunity would even go so far as to permit the president to get away with having his opponents murdered by SEAL Team Six. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1901.0s)]
*  And Trump's federal January 6 election interference trial is effectively on hold while we wait for that ruling there. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1910.0s)]
*  There is also the open question in Florida of Florida Judge Aline Cannon, the Trump appointee overseeing his criminal case for stealing classified documents. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1918.0s)]
*  At this point, it's become really quite clear that Cannon is more than happy to play along with Trump's delay strategy by pushing back deadlines, seemingly at the ex president's whim. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1929.0s)]
*  And there's the latest developments in the Fulton County D.A. Fonny Willis's election interference and racketeering case. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1939.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers argue that Willis should be disqualified over allegations she engaged in an improper romantic relationship with that man, Nathan Wade, who's one of the prosecutors on the case. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  Willis has defended herself strenuously, defended her choice of hiring Wade, despite a relative lack of prosecutorial experience on his part. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1958.0s)]
*  Willis has neither confirmed nor denied a personal relationship between them, instead saying she will respond through the proper legal channels. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1965.0s)]
*  According to documents from Wade's wife as part of his divorce case, which was temporarily settled today, he did purchase plane tickets to Miami and to San Francisco for Willis and himself, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1973.0s)]
*  which critics have pointed to as proof she financially benefited from his position. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1984.0s)]
*  We've got to stress, there's still a lot about this we don't know about the facts at play here. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1989.0s)]
*  It bears repeating that these allegations first surfaced in a legal filing clearly designed to delay a very strong case against Trump and his co-defendants, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=1993.0s)]
*  a case in which four of those co-defendants have already pleaded guilty. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2002.0s)]
*  The Georgia case is also the subject of a bombshell new book that's already making headlines for its reporting on the story behind Willis' landmark prosecution of Trump and 18 others. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2007.0s)]
*  One of the authors, Michael Isikoff, joins me live right here next. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  It's been just over three years since the infamous phone call in which Donald Trump pushed the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2036.0s)]
*  to, quote, flip the state electoral results by finding those votes. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2065.0s)]
*  Since then, Trump has been indicted by Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fonny Willis, along with 18 others in a wide ranging racketeering case. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2070.0s)]
*  Now, so far, four of those co-conspirators, you see them there, I'm taking guilty, please. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2080.0s)]
*  But if or when Donald Trump sees the inside of a court himself, at least in Fulton County, is very much up in the air. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2085.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Michael Isikoff. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2091.0s)]
*  He's the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News, co-author of the new book on Trump's attempts to steal the election in Georgia, titled, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  Find Me the Votes, a Hard-Charging Georgia Prosecutor, a Rogue President and the Plot to Steal an American Election, which is out today. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2100.0s)]
*  Great to have you here, Michael. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2107.0s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2108.0s)]
*  Let's start on the Fonny Willis stuff happening right now, which is, I'm not quite sure what to make of it, and I don't think there's both sort of establishing the factual record, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2109.0s)]
*  which seems a little opaque still, whether there was any impropriety, and then fundamentally if there's like a legal issue that will affect the case. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2120.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2128.0s)]
*  What's your reason? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2129.0s)]
*  So look, my co-author, Dan Kleiman, and I spent a lot of time talking to Fonny Willis. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2130.0s)]
*  We had multiple interviews. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2134.0s)]
*  We spent hours talking to her and people around her. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2135.0s)]
*  She is unquestionably a talented prosecutor. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2138.0s)]
*  She was the star litigator in the Fulton County District Attorney's Office for years. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2142.0s)]
*  And she's extremely talented, a professional attorney, but she's made some missteps here. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2147.0s)]
*  We talk in the book about one of them when she sponsored a fundraiser for a friend of hers who was running against one of the targets of the investigation that led to the judge saying, what do you think? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2157.0s)]
*  This was a what were you thinking moment? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2167.0s)]
*  It's fair to say the Nathan Wade relationship is another what were you thinking moment. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2169.0s)]
*  It was a misjudgment and a mistake by her. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2175.0s)]
*  I think she'll acknowledge that. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2179.0s)]
*  But that said, taking a step back, let's remember this had absolutely no impact on the case whatsoever. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2181.0s)]
*  It didn't deny any defendants their constitutional rights. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2188.0s)]
*  It didn't show prejudice in the bringing in any aspect of the case. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2191.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2196.0s)]
*  She's going to file a response this Friday. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2197.0s)]
*  I'm expecting a quite vigorous response in which she will challenge at least some of the allegations out there. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2200.0s)]
*  And we'll see where it's settled. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2207.0s)]
*  But I'll be surprised if the judge, Judge McAfee, ends up granting this motion or disqualifying her for simply the lack of any impact on the case at all. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2209.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  That seems the sort of threshold is a legal issue in terms of the case, in terms of her removal. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2221.0s)]
*  One of the fascinating bits of reporting in your book is about the actual person that recorded that infamous phone call. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2226.0s)]
*  A phone call that I have to say, even as we played it just now, is shocking every time you hear it because it is so over the line, even as it pretends to not be over the line. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2233.0s)]
*  Find me the voids, flip it, the cheating. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2244.0s)]
*  Tell me about who the person is that recorded that. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2247.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2249.0s)]
*  This is one of the unheralded stories of the 2020 election battle. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2250.0s)]
*  Just to set the stage here, Brad Raffensperger was the Secretary of State. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2256.0s)]
*  Trump and his team are adamant about pressuring Raffensperger to alter the results of the election. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2261.0s)]
*  Mark Meadows, the White House Chief of Staff, contacts Raffensperger's Chief of Staff, a young woman, 30-year-old Jordan Fuchs, Republican consultant, strategist who was hired as the Chief of Staff, and had been with Raffensperger through all the turmoil after the election. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2270.0s)]
*  And just to be clear, just to set a context here, you're the Chief of Staff of the Georgia Secretary of State. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2287.0s)]
*  You're not getting the President of the United States Chief of Staff calling you. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2292.0s)]
*  Like that's a big thing when that happens. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2295.0s)]
*  They were trying to contact Raffensperger repeatedly, but he didn't want to touch them because they're in litigation. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2297.0s)]
*  Trump is suing them, right? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2303.0s)]
*  Completely improper. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2305.0s)]
*  And Jordan Fuchs knows the danger for Raffensperger to get on the phone with Donald Trump, who has a habit of distorting anything that would get said in that phone call. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2306.0s)]
*  And she, on her own, makes the decision, unilateral decision. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2317.0s)]
*  She's going to tape the call. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2322.0s)]
*  She puts, she's on the phone call, but you never hear her voice. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2324.0s)]
*  She put herself on mute. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2327.0s)]
*  She didn't tell Raffensperger she was taping it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2329.0s)]
*  She didn't tell Meadows she was taping it. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2331.0s)]
*  She didn't tell Trump that she was taking it. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2333.0s)]
*  One problem that arose after this, you know, the tape went wild, is that she happened to be in Florida at the time, visiting her grandparents. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2336.0s)]
*  And Florida is a two-party consent state. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2348.0s)]
*  So she was risking potential criminal prosecution in Florida. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2351.0s)]
*  Now, I don't think that's ever going to happen because, among other things, there's an exemption for law enforcement, and the Secretary of State's office is a law enforcement agency. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2359.0s)]
*  But the bottom line here is she's never spoken about this, but she did when called before the grand jury, was given immunity, and acknowledged she taped the call. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2367.0s)]
*  It was the single, gutsiest, and most consequential act of the entire post-election battle, and it's all because this one young woman, Republican consultant, on her own, made the decision to do it. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2377.0s)]
*  Thirty-year-old Chief of Staff, she's in Orlando, right, her grandparents. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2392.0s)]
*  So in the moment, she decided she would protect the boss, Raffensperger. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2395.0s)]
*  When the White House witcher packed the President's shoe, she put herself on mute without telling Raffensperger or Meadows she taped the call, which is why we have that infamous call. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2399.0s)]
*  One of the other aspects you're reporting, I think, is really crucial is the security story around Fonny Willis. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2406.0s)]
*  And the reason it's so crucial is we know and I know anyone who comes into Trump's crosshairs faces an enormous security problem. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2413.0s)]
*  Often they can't and don't want to talk about it that much publicly because it doesn't really help your security problem. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2421.0s)]
*  You do some real reporting on what Fonny Willis' life looks like now. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2427.0s)]
*  It was pretty horrendous, far worse than anybody knew. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2431.0s)]
*  Look, Trump was riling up his people throughout this entire investigation, calling her a Marxist, a radical, a racist, anything that would get people riled up to attack her. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2435.0s)]
*  And she's getting subjected to these just awful threats against her, against her family. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2447.0s)]
*  We talk about one computer-disguised call to her cell phone in which the guy is bringing up her daughters and saying he knows where they live and they're in danger. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2454.0s)]
*  This is a phone call on her personal cell phone. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2467.0s)]
*  On her personal cell phone. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2469.0s)]
*  Talking about Willis' two daughters. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2470.0s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2471.0s)]
*  Okay, let's cut to what I think is one of the most dramatic stories of this whole saga. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2472.0s)]
*  The night of the indictment, she announces it at a midnight press conference and they just learned that there was an assassination threat. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2477.0s)]
*  The best time to shoot her is when she leaves the building. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2484.0s)]
*  Fonny Willis goes back to her office, takes off her business suit. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2486.0s)]
*  This is after the press conference. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2490.0s)]
*  Takes off her pearls, puts on sweats of the baseball cap, and then a body double, a body double puts on Willis' suit and leaves. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2492.0s)]
*  Willis is smuggled out the back of the building to an undisclosed location. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2502.0s)]
*  All that can be found in Finding the Votes, co-authored by Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klayman. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2508.0s)]
*  You can find that in bookstores and online right now. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avV9AHa7nzQ&t=2513.0s)]
