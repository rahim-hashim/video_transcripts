# Wake up, America’: Birth control, IVF in jeopardy under GOP, warns Rep. Katie Porter
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM)
*  So we've been covering the gap between the kind of mealy-mouth platitudes of politicians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=0.0s)]
*  who recognize their actual views on reproductive rights are totally unpopular and who basically [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=6.0s)]
*  want to trick people, the gap between what they say and what they do. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=11.44s)]
*  In fact, the speaker of the House, Republican Mike Johnson, said just yesterday he supports [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=14.24s)]
*  IVF. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=19.12s)]
*  Look, I believe in the sanctity of every human life, always have. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=20.12s)]
*  And because of that, I support IVF and its availability. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=25.28s)]
*  It needs to be readily available. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  It needs to be something that every American supports and it needs to be handled in an [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=29.92s)]
*  ethical manner. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=34.04s)]
*  So we'll continue to support that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=35.24s)]
*  Okay, it needs to be handled in an ethical matter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=37.64s)]
*  That's the key part there, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=40.68s)]
*  I believe in IVF, it needs to be readily available, but ethical matter, what's he mean by that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=41.88s)]
*  So that's what he stood at the podium and said. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=46.660000000000004s)]
*  Well, crucially, if you want to know what that ethical matter he's referring to is, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  he remains a co-sponsor of the Life at Conception Bill, which would codify personhood at the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  moment of fertilization and full 14th Amendment due process rights for frozen embryos with [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=59.56s)]
*  absolutely no carve out for IVF. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=67.66s)]
*  A reminder to watch what they do, not what they say. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Today we have more evidence of that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=74.08s)]
*  Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced a non-binding resolution [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=75.68s)]
*  that does nothing except, quote, express support for continued access to fertility care like [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=80.88s)]
*  And even this pathetically toothless resolution gets only six Republican co-sponsors. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=86.72s)]
*  But get this, yesterday, 145 Republicans in Congress file an amicus brief asking the Supreme [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=96.12s)]
*  Court to restrict access to the abortion drug, methampristone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=103.84s)]
*  And in asking the court to ban the mailing of abortion pills anywhere in the U.S., they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=108.32s)]
*  cite the Comstock Act. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=112.42s)]
*  That's a basically dead law from the 1870s named out for an infamous misogynistic anti-vice [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=113.7s)]
*  crusader that banned the mailing of obscene materials or anything, quote, intended for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=120.02s)]
*  the prevention of contraception or procuring of abortion. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=124.86s)]
*  Mind you, more than half of all abortions in the U.S. were medication abortions in 2020. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=130.34s)]
*  Methampristone is the drug commonly used in that procedure. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=134.58s)]
*  A right-wing anti-abortion district judge in Texas already tried to ban methampristone [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=138.42s)]
*  nationwide. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  And just a few weeks, the Supreme Court will actually hear that case that started with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  him. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=148.82s)]
*  And so those 145 Republicans in Congress are affirmatively choosing to sign an amicus brief. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=149.82s)]
*  They don't have to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=155.14s)]
*  They are just announcing to you their real intentions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=156.64s)]
*  Congresswoman Katie Porter is a Democrat of California. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  She's a member of the Pro-Choice Caucus. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  She's a candidate for the Senate in 2024. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=164.1s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=166.22s)]
*  I'm curious, as a member of Congress, what you make... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=169.02s)]
*  I was cracking up the Nancy Mays thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=170.78s)]
*  And here's why I was cracking up at it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=173.38s)]
*  It does seem like an easy slam dunk. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=175.32s)]
*  Like, they know they have a problem. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=177.42s)]
*  This wild Alabama state Supreme Court decision which imperiled IVF in that state, the co-sponsorship [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=179.14s)]
*  of the Life at Conception Act. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=186.06s)]
*  Like, why would they rush to do that? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=189.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, this entire thing is about Nancy Mays being performative, about the Republican [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=193.82000000000002s)]
*  Party trying to convince people and lull them into thinking that they will not come for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=200.9s)]
*  every last bit of women's freedom to make their own decisions about their health and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=207.78s)]
*  about when and if to start a family. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=212.72s)]
*  Look, people said Roe would never fall. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=214.78s)]
*  It fell. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=218.22s)]
*  Now they're saying, well, they never attack things like IVF. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=219.22s)]
*  Well, they never attack birth control. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=222.42s)]
*  Wake up America. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=224.42s)]
*  Everyone who is a woman or knows and loves a woman and believes in freedom ought to be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=226.42s)]
*  up in arms about this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=231.66s)]
*  And the only solution here is vote them out. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=233.06s)]
*  Do you think if the results of the 2024 election were that the Republicans took majorities [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=238.78s)]
*  in both houses of Congress and elected Donald Trump to be the president, is there any doubt [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=244.9s)]
*  in your mind whether they would sign a national abortion ban? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=249.06s)]
*  No. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=252.22s)]
*  You know why? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=253.22s)]
*  Because they've said they will do exactly that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=255.06s)]
*  As you point out, they are relying, the Republicans, 145 of them, 90 percent of whom are men, who [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  signed that amicus brief are relying on the Comstock Act. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=266.02s)]
*  What does that apply to? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=270.5s)]
*  It provides, applies to the prevention of contraception, the prevention of pregnancy, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=271.78s)]
*  excuse me, the prevention of conception. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=277.98s)]
*  That means it applies to birth control, to contraception. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=279.62s)]
*  So this is the beginning. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=282.22s)]
*  And if we don't act, it will be the end. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=284.5s)]
*  So I think we have to quit mincing words and quit trying to reassure Americans. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=286.86s)]
*  Our rights are under attack and we need to fight like hell. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=292.18s)]
*  I wonder how that, how you think that people hear that in the state of California, because [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=297.3s)]
*  one of the things that has happened post-Dobbs is that the bifurcation of the states, right, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=302.3s)]
*  it was quote unquote returned to the states. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  And that means that some states have outlawed abortions, some states have actually secured [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=311.94s)]
*  abortion rights, have reaffirmed them, right, actually put them into statutory protections. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=315.7s)]
*  But for people in a state like California, do you think voters are aware that those state [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=320.86s)]
*  protections are going to be superseded by natural legislation? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=326.7s)]
*  If these people who want to ban abortion manage to win power. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=331.44s)]
*  Californians definitely feel safe. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=335.96s)]
*  They feel like they can make their own choices here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=338.88s)]
*  And we have leadership in our state that has reassured them of that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=341.08s)]
*  But the reality is this is just simple fifth grade civics class. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=345.2s)]
*  The federal government has the ability to make laws that are supreme to state law. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=350.0s)]
*  So when Trump says there will be a nationwide abortion ban, there won't be one thing, a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=355.88s)]
*  single lawmaker in California can do about it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=360.64s)]
*  Do you think this issue in your conversation, both in your campaigning in California for [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=366.28s)]
*  this, the soon to be open Senate seat and also in the context of, you know, traveling [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=373.84s)]
*  the state and thinking about this 2024 election, I think some people misapprehend how [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=381.24s)]
*  salient the issue is. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=387.44s)]
*  My sense is that it's every bit as salient as the day Dobbs came out and even more so. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=388.6s)]
*  Do you get that sense from the voters that you talk to? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  Or do you think people have sort of been lulled in some false sense of security in a state [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=397.12s)]
*  like California? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=401.44s)]
*  Well, it's very, very important to people to have the freedom to make this decision for [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=403.0s)]
*  themselves. That, I think, is as strong and as urgent and people feel really strongly [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=407.92s)]
*  about it. And each time we've actually seen this issue be put cleanly on the ballot for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=413.48s)]
*  an up down vote, Americans across the country have said they want their own rights to make [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=418.24s)]
*  their own decisions. The problem has been that we're not making it clear to voters that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=422.32s)]
*  this is on the ballot in every single federal election in every part and pocket of this [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=427.8s)]
*  country. It's on the ballot in California. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=433.64s)]
*  And, you know, in the Senate race, we have had colleagues, I've had Democratic colleagues say [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=436.64s)]
*  things like, you know, the decision to reverse Roe, it's a sign of things to come. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=440.72s)]
*  It's not a sign of anything. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  It is actually resulting in women and girls dying right now. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=448.32s)]
*  And so I think that reflects the lack of urgency, that kind of language. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=452.76s)]
*  This is a harbinger of what's to come. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=456.2s)]
*  This is part of the gradual erosion of our democracy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=458.6s)]
*  It is it is about people not having freedom today. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=462.6s)]
*  It is about our daughters having less freedom than we had. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=467.8s)]
*  And so I think there needs to be more urgency on this from elected leaders across the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=471.92s)]
*  country, including here in California. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qujvFTAWQKM&t=475.8s)]
