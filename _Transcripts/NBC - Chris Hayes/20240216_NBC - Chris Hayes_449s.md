# 'Put the bill on the floor': Dem rep calls on GOP to stop blocking Ukraine aid
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw)
*  This tragedy reminds us of the stakes of this moment. We had to provide the funding so Ukraine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=0.0s)]
*  can keep defending itself against Putin's vicious onslaughts and war crimes. You know, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=6.76s)]
*  there was a bipartisan Senate vote that passed overwhelmingly in the United States Senate [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=14.6s)]
*  to fund Ukraine. Now, as I've said before, and I mean this in a literal sense, history [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=19.12s)]
*  is watching. History is watching the House of Representatives. The failure to support [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=24.68s)]
*  Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten. The death of Russian opposition [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=29.92s)]
*  leader Alexei Navalny and the reminder of the vicious nature of the Putin regime comes [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=36.16s)]
*  in this crucial moment where the Ukrainian army resisting Russian aggression is basically [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=40.04s)]
*  running out of bullets and sending dire warnings. A bipartisan package that includes aid for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=44.56s)]
*  Ukraine has passed the Senate. The House is basically refusing to take it up under orders [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=49.76s)]
*  of Putin's number one American enabler, the head of the Republican Party, Donald Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=55.0s)]
*  Now, some Republicans have posted little tweets and statements, Speaker Mike Johnson even [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=59.28s)]
*  saying we must be clear that Putin will be met with United opposition. But they are not [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=63.32s)]
*  discussing the obvious elephant in the room, which is that the reason Mike Johnson is not [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=67.72s)]
*  taking up the foreign aid package is because Donald Trump doesn't want Ukraine aid to pass. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  He wants Putin to emerge victorious because he needs Putin's support. Joining me now is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=76.62s)]
*  Congressman Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois. He represents one of the oldest and largest [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian American communities in the U.S. He's been an outspoken proponent of supporting [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=85.94s)]
*  Ukraine. He's also co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus. Congressman, it's great to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=90.5s)]
*  have you on. First, just start with what you think the import of the death of Navalny in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  Russian custody is for the conversation debate about aid here in the U.S.? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=103.26s)]
*  Sure. I think it's important that he not die in vain. He is a hero for our lifetime. The reason [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  we're fighting in Ukraine is the reason we fought the Second World War, the fight against tyrants [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  taking over a sovereign democratic country. So I think the best way we can honor him is get the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  hell back to Washington, D.C. and pass this aid package. It's extraordinarily frustrating, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=129.9s)]
*  largely because you talk about voices from the past. Let's remember the Reagan doctrine. He [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=136.18s)]
*  spoke eloquently of defending any ally against Soviet aggression, and there would be no limit [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=143.54000000000002s)]
*  to that. Well, this is the quintessential opportunity to step up and do just that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  And remember that I guess I will also remember that we still have other friends there, Evan, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=154.3s)]
*  Paul, Mark and others, as well as what? You know, roughly 100,000 Ukrainian children stolen by [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Putin. If this isn't the time we step up, we've got to ask ourselves who we are as a country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=168.5s)]
*  Now, there is a Senate bill that's passed. The House has just been is on a recess for the next [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=174.18s)]
*  two weeks, if I understand that correctly, through February 28th, I believe. This is the Wall Street [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=181.82s)]
*  Journal today talking about how Mike Johnson's basically lost control of the House of Representatives. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  I can't think of a better way to say it and how he would get this to the floor. Johnson's challenge [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=192.82s)]
*  uniting his conference now loom over efforts to shore up Ukraine. Just as Congress also faces [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=197.98s)]
*  deadlines next month to pass legislation funding the federal government, avoid a partial shutdown. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=203.38s)]
*  House Democrats are weighing unusual parliamentary maneuvers that require the help of at least a few [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=208.34s)]
*  Republicans to execute. They include a discharge position, a move designed to circumvent the House [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=213.18s)]
*  Speaker and force a vote on Ukraine. I read today that people were talking about a discharge [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=218.46s)]
*  position at the Munich Security Conference halfway across the world. What are the conversations [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=223.54s)]
*  amongst Democrats and maybe with other Republicans happening right now about that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=228.5s)]
*  Look, there's probably about a half the Republicans in their caucus who support funding Ukraine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=232.18s)]
*  And how do you do that? How do you get a bill to the floor? First, real simple, the speaker lets the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=239.38s)]
*  bill get to the floor. I think democracy dictates that when the Senate passes something in this day [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=246.34s)]
*  and age with 70 votes, I mean, McCann put the bill on the floor. There are other options. As you might [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=251.3s)]
*  know, the paperwork was done today to do a discharge petition using that Senate bill. It's probably [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=257.85999999999996s)]
*  the only bill that can get to the president's desk. It is not perfect. Another bill that was [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=266.02s)]
*  attempted that also dealt with border security was squelched by, I guess, the Republican on high, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=272.82s)]
*  candidate Trump. So this is our best opportunity. I asked my Republican colleagues, I asked the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  Speaker of the House to have that sense of history and recognize that sometimes doing the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=285.85999999999996s)]
*  right thing is more important than keeping your gavel. At some point, who's going to remember [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=290.58s)]
*  who the Speaker of the House was when we did something so horrible and he's the one that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  held it back? That's a sense of history he should have as well. Let me ask you, you've been very [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=302.17999999999995s)]
*  outspoken on this issue and you represent a ton of folks who are Ukrainian-American from the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=307.46s)]
*  Ukrainian diaspora and people have relatives and family there. Are there, you said half the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=314.66s)]
*  Republican caucus, and in my sense is there's probably 300 votes in the House right now, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=320.82000000000005s)]
*  something like that, for this aid package, maybe 280 somewhere there. Are there people on the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=325.14000000000004s)]
*  Republican side in leadership who share your conviction and do they have any say in this? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=330.74s)]
*  I mean, is it just Johnson taking orders from the sort of far right of the caucus and Trump or [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  people who view this the same way you do? Look, I traveled to Germany with Republicans who care. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=344.9s)]
*  We were visiting Ukrainian troops learning how to use our tanks. I traveled to Ukraine with [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=353.46s)]
*  Franchil, who was very dedicated to this cause. My message to all my Republican friends is, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=359.62s)]
*  if the far right can hijack your party with 10 to 20 people, you can take it back. You can make [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=366.1s)]
*  a stand. If 10 or 20 can threaten the speaker to do the wrong thing, nearly half of the caucus [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=373.78s)]
*  can threaten the speaker to do the right thing. There's not going to be a more important bill [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=382.17999999999995s)]
*  that deals with democracy in our lifetime. I said this is the reason we fought the Second World War. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=387.05999999999995s)]
*  It's why we formed the United Nations. It's why we formed NATO. It is the essence of our own security. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=393.29999999999995s)]
*  If we don't remember voices from the past, let's remember those from the future. Let's think about [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=399.78s)]
*  those from right now, that is General Milley and Secretary Austin who said, if you don't stand up [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=404.41999999999996s)]
*  to the aggression of Putin, you're going to have to double our defense budget and you're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=410.73999999999995s)]
*  certainly inviting more bloodshed. All right, Congressman Mike Quigley again, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=415.05999999999995s)]
*  Congressman from Illinois, Chicago, neighborhoods I lived in and loved. It's great to have you on, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=420.34s)]
*  Congressman. Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdwkHOvfKxw&t=426.02s)]
