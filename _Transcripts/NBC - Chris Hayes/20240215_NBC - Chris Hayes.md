# All In with Chris Hayes - Feb. 15  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=0.0s)]
*  You're confused. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=4.0s)]
*  You think I'm on trial. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=5.0s)]
*  These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=6.28s)]
*  An explosive day of Trump trial news ends with a doozy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=9.88s)]
*  Tonight there is something way more troubling. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=15.16s)]
*  The FBI informant Republicans hoped would take down Joe Biden is arrested. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=18.48s)]
*  A trusted, highly credible informant. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=24.52s)]
*  A very credible FBI informant. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=27.48s)]
*  A guy with impeccable credentials. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=30.12s)]
*  Tonight, Jamie Raskin on the spectacular collapse of a MAGA attack. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=32.32s)]
*  Then what today's Fannie Willis hearing means for the prosecution of Donald Trump in Georgia. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=37.0s)]
*  A date is finally set for Trump's hush money trial in New York and the indicted frontrunner's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=42.4s)]
*  push to install his family at the RNC so he can siphon campaign cash to pay criminal attorneys. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Every single penny will go to the number one and the only job of the RNC that is electing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=55.04s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=60.68s)]
*  What All In starts right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=62.44s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, it has been quite a day of news in the many cases against Donald Trump. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  There were, as you might have seen earlier today, fireworks in Fulton County in a Georgia [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  courtroom where the prosecutor who brought the racketeering case against Donald Trump [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=80.0s)]
*  and his co-defendants, that woman, Fannie Willis, spent the day on the stand defending [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=84.36s)]
*  herself from attempts to pull her off the case. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=89.0s)]
*  In Manhattan, a judge set the date for what may be the start of the first criminal trial [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=92.8s)]
*  of the ex-president. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  We're going to get into all of that later on the show, but first we begin with another [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  case and that's the one the Republicans have drummed up against President Joe Biden's only [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=103.36s)]
*  living son. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=108.36s)]
*  Four years, the right wing has been running a sketchy, tawdry political operation to find [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=111.24s)]
*  and prosecute any wrongdoing by the president's son, Hunter Biden. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  And the president's son has, of course, as we all know, made some very bad judgment calls [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=120.36s)]
*  over the years, largely, I think, related to his lifelong struggle with addiction. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=124.96s)]
*  But he has been targeted in what is essentially a political hit job intended to inflict pain [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  upon his father. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  He's facing criminal charges by a special prosecutor in the Department of Justice that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=138.12s)]
*  many experts say would never be brought against anyone who is not the son of the president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=142.88s)]
*  Now, some of the most serious claims leveled against Hunter Biden have to do with his work [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=148.68s)]
*  for a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma and alleged payments they made to the Bidens. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Plural. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=159.08s)]
*  You see, Republicans have been yelling from the rooftops about Burisma and alleged bribes [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=160.08s)]
*  paid not only to Hunter Biden, but to Joe Biden, to the man himself, the president of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=164.28s)]
*  the United States who was then vice president. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=169.16s)]
*  That idea of illicit, secret, seven-figure bribes to the man who's currently president [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=171.52s)]
*  has been the central point of their whole attack. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=177.48s)]
*  And today, in the most spectacular embarrassment unmanageable, it blew up in their faces. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=181.04s)]
*  You see the special counsel, Republican appointee, leading the case against Hunter Biden, who [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=187.64s)]
*  was appointed by Donald Trump, now says that that guy, this informant they hung their entire [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=192.6s)]
*  claim on about the bribe, he lied. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=198.56s)]
*  Their infamous FBI informant is being federally criminally charged for making it all up. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=202.88s)]
*  Documented allegations of bribery from a trusted FBI confidential human source has [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=209.8s)]
*  now finally been released. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=217.8s)]
*  Now its contents are devastating. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=219.52s)]
*  Okay, I am sparing you the amount of Sean Hannity I could play you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=222.0s)]
*  For my sins, I watched about 30 minutes of monologues. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=226.36s)]
*  But in his show, Fox host Sean Hannity alone promoted the claim of this single FBI informant [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=230.44s)]
*  no less than 85 times last year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=236.36s)]
*  28 of those segments were monologues, very long monologues, in addition to all the breathless [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=239.84s)]
*  so-called reporting. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=246.08s)]
*  And this is across the right-wing media. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=247.28s)]
*  Hannity had House Oversight Committee Chairman and Chief Biden Crime Family Investigator [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  James Comer on as a guest 43 times in 2023. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=254.12s)]
*  Today, James Comer and Sean Hannity's favorite informant, the smoking gun for their investigation, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  was arrested at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=264.12s)]
*  He was indicted on two counts of feeding the FBI false information about President Joe [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=267.92s)]
*  Biden and his son Hunter. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  According to that indictment, 43-year-old Alexander Smirnov's story about Burisma officials [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=276.12s)]
*  paying the Bidens million quote was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  meetings and context. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=288.56s)]
*  Joining me now is an NBC News justice reporter, Ryan Riley. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=291.0s)]
*  Ryan, this is really quite a bombshell. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  First, tell us who this individual is. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=297.08s)]
*  So he'd been an FBI informant actually for kind of a long time, I believe since 2010. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=301.32s)]
*  So this isn't somebody who just like came along, but he was very anti-Biden according [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=306.23999999999995s)]
*  to this indictment and was going back and forth with his FBI handler and was sort of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=310.23999999999995s)]
*  suggesting contemporaneously in 2020 that this could impact the presidential race, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=315.08s)]
*  This was some of the text that we sort of see impacted there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=322.52s)]
*  He said, this is going to come out. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=325.48s)]
*  So this sort of suggestion that I read into those messages was that he was sort of going [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=326.64s)]
*  through other avenues and getting this out through the media, saying that this is going [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=332.48s)]
*  to come out soon. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=335.56s)]
*  So it wasn't just sort of feeding this into the FBI and putting bad information there, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=336.56s)]
*  but also trying to weaponize it outside, obviously, through messages to either members of Congress [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=340.6s)]
*  or through the media and what have you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=345.52s)]
*  And it was all just made up, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=347.12s)]
*  It was just purely made up stuff that he put there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=348.8s)]
*  So if you've ever seen a headline, you wouldn't have seen it at NBC News because we treated [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=351.6s)]
*  it responsibly. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=356.0s)]
*  But if you've ever seen a headline about some $5 million payment to Joe Biden, this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=357.0s)]
*  is what that all came from. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=360.52s)]
*  This is sort of the fruit of the poisonous tree that this all came from. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=362.12s)]
*  And it's what a lot of this impeachment inquiry is really about, Chris. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=365.32s)]
*  Let me show you some of these headlines. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=367.96s)]
*  The New York Post, also owned by Robert Murdoch like Fox, Biden $10 million bribe file. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  Burisma chief said he was coerced to pay Joe's stupid hunter in bombshell allegations. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=375.2s)]
*  Joe Biden allegedly paid $5 million by Burisma executive as part of a bribery scheme, according [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=379.76s)]
*  to FBI document. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, here's where it gets interesting. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  That FBI document was that this confidential informant wrote a form making his bribery [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=387.2s)]
*  allegation. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  In fact, it's part of what he's being indicted for since it was a fabrication. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  But then in this kind of alley-oop play, right, the Republicans on the Hill know this document [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=397.32s)]
*  exists and they shake it loose to the public. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=403.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=405.96s)]
*  This is Chuck Grassley back in July of 2023. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=406.96s)]
*  For the better part of a year, I've been pushing the Justice Department, FBI, to provide details [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=409.48s)]
*  on its handling of very significant allegations from a trusted FBI informant, implicating [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  then Vice President Biden in a criminal bribery scheme. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=419.44s)]
*  So they know about it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=422.56s)]
*  They browbeat the DOJ to shake it loose as if they're covering up for it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=423.8s)]
*  And now it turns out the man's being indicted for fabricating it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=427.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=432.24s)]
*  And James Comer actually threatened to hold the FBI director, Chris Wray, in contempt, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=433.24s)]
*  right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, this was a serious thing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  They really wanted to get this document and it was all just nonsense and based on nothing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  And remember, this was at the time when Donald Trump was the executive, right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=443.8s)]
*  He was in the White House. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=448.2s)]
*  He was overseeing the Justice Department and FBI, theoretically. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  So this wasn't something like that would have been crushed back then. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=454.16s)]
*  It wasn't pursued because it wasn't really reliable, right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=456.20000000000005s)]
*  Like, in terms of getting $5 million to two individuals, that's something that shows up. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  That's tough to hide. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=463.92s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of ways you can determine that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=464.92s)]
*  And we sort of know how Joe Biden made his money. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=467.08000000000004s)]
*  It's through a good book deal he got after he was vice president. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  A lot of former officials, former vice presidents and presidents, get nice book deals. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=472.12s)]
*  And that's how they pay for things afterwards. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=476.12s)]
*  And that just wasn't really what was happening here. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=478.44s)]
*  If there was $5 million that was showing up, there would have been some other evidence of that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  And really all they had was this one FBI informant saying this, who now the FBI and now the FBI [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=484.48s)]
*  and now the special prosecutor here says just completely made this all up and invented [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=489.56s)]
*  conversations that he claimed happened earlier when they didn't really happen. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=493.68s)]
*  And he had these contacts with Burisma officials. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=497.48s)]
*  He actually did have those contacts, but he said they happened a lot earlier than they did, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=500.64s)]
*  when in reality he wasn't in contact with Burisma officials until 2017, which is, of course, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=504.2s)]
*  after Joe Biden is already out of office and can't be pulling any strings or having any sort of influence [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=510.0s)]
*  as vice president at the time that was sort of alleged here in the underlying allegations from Republicans. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=515.0s)]
*  I remember when, to your point, when we covered this the first time, I think, on air, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=521.0s)]
*  I remember basically saying like, let's just take a step back and do a little Occam's razor here, right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  What do you think the explanation is? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=528.64s)]
*  Was a $5 million bribe secretly shepherded to the sitting vice president of the time [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=530.64s)]
*  by a corrupt foreign interest that just no one figured out, including Donald Trump's own Justice Department, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=535.9599999999999s)]
*  was sitting on it or was that fabricated? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=541.36s)]
*  Well, today I think we have a pretty definitive answer. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=543.92s)]
*  Ryan Reilly, thank you very much. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=546.56s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=550.76s)]
*  He is actually the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, which has been investigating these claims. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=552.92s)]
*  In a statement tonight, he said, quote, I formally call on Speaker Johnson, Chairman Comer and House [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=558.24s)]
*  Republicans to stop promoting this nonsense and end their doomed impeachment inquiry. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=563.16s)]
*  Congressman Raskin joins me now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=569.64s)]
*  Is this the end of the road for this line of investigation, Congressman? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=572.12s)]
*  I certainly hope so. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  The members of the committee on the Democratic side have seen these fraudulent allegations debunked time and time again. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  Lev Parnas wrote a letter to Chairman Comer to me. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  He was Rudy Giuliani's right hand man. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=594.88s)]
*  He said, I was sent out there to concoct this case. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=597.56s)]
*  There's nothing to it. We've seen the testimony of Devin Archer completely debunking it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=600.8s)]
*  The former president of Ukraine, Poroshenko, debunked it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=606.88s)]
*  The Republicans on the Senate side in 2020 did their own investigation and said they couldn't find anything to it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=612.8s)]
*  So we're not that surprised that this has happened, but it is an amazing turn of events. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=619.44s)]
*  And I do think it's an opportunity for a reset on the Republican side. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  We could use the oversight powers of Congress to be looking at the problem of gun violence, for example, or we could be looking at climate change. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=629.2s)]
*  Or if they want to stick with this issue, let's look at the question of presidents and their families selling out the government of the United States. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=638.08s)]
*  We did a minority report of our own. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  We released it over a month ago now, Chris. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=648.24s)]
*  I think I came on to talk about it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=651.44s)]
*  We found in documented receipts nearly eight million dollars that Donald Trump collected at his hotels and golf courses from China, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, lots of countries. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=653.16s)]
*  We could really look at the whole question of foreign government emoluments in a bipartisan way. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=665.0s)]
*  And we could even look at the question of other family members using their names in order to make deals with foreign governments. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=669.92s)]
*  Fine. Let's look at that, too. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=675.88s)]
*  But let's be serious about it and let's deal with the facts rigorously rather than in mythological ways. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=677.2s)]
*  One of the things I think is key to highlight here, and I just want to lay it out and you tell me if I have this right, is that it's always been the case that Hunter Biden's work for [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  Bereisman was documented. Right. That was absolutely we know that happened. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=692.2s)]
*  We know the payments were made to him, et cetera. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=695.6s)]
*  They've never and Hunter Biden had a business consulting with various entities. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  The thing they've never been able to demonstrate, and I think because it didn't happen, is connecting it to Joe Biden, to the president, United States, to the man who's actually the sitting president, who they want to impeach. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=702.68s)]
*  The reason they lean so heavily on this now, it appears fabricated allegation is because the only thing out there anywhere that made that leap. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=712.64s)]
*  In fact, several Sean Hannity monologues talk at length about this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=721.88s)]
*  Right. This is the one. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=725.4s)]
*  This is the thing that connects to Joe Biden. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=726.84s)]
*  That's why this is so important. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=729.24s)]
*  Well, Jim Jordan said it is the key allegation in the whole constellation of allegations. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=733.24s)]
*  Chairman Comer was on TV yesterday talking about it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=740.2s)]
*  They clearly view it as the heart of the whole investigation. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  Already, they're starting to backpedal and say, oh, it wasn't really about Burisma in Ukraine. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, then what was it about? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=752.84s)]
*  Nobody can determine what it was about. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=754.68s)]
*  Mike Johnson, in endorsing the impeachment inquiry, went right to the Burisma allegation. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=757.16s)]
*  So this really is the heart of it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's an opportunity for them to say, you know what, we gave it our best shot, but we're going to give up the ghost. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=764.4799999999999s)]
*  There's nothing there. Even Donald Trump's handpicked special counsel, Mr. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=769.4799999999999s)]
*  Weiss, has now brought charges against this confidential human informant, who turns out, presumably, allegedly to have been engaged in a fraud from the very beginning. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's what we have said, because there's simply no other evidence that's ever supported it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=784.36s)]
*  So on the question of impeachment, which is it was always the case. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump is very, very public. He wants Joe Biden to be impeached. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  I think if he were to face criminal trial this year, which I think is likely they would like to impeach Joe Biden around that time to essentially have kind of counterprogramming. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=797.28s)]
*  That's my supposition. Now, they need a full vote of the House to do that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  They just impeached Alejandro Mayorkas over what was clearly a policy dispute with no even allegation of a high crime or misdemeanor. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=810.68s)]
*  But it took them two tries. They failed on the first vote. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  They succeeded by one vote the second time. Subsequent to that, a new Democrat has been elected in the third congressional district in New York. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=819.52s)]
*  Their majority is now 219 to 213. It means they can only lose two votes on anything if it's a party line vote. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=826.2399999999999s)]
*  It seems to me like it's dead. But I mean, maybe I'm getting out of hell with myself, but I don't think they're going to be able to impeach the president not just because they have nothing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=836.28s)]
*  But now they also don't have the votes. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=843.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, that's right. And, you know, they when you say that Mayorkas was impeached over a policy dispute, the policy dispute was they did not want Mayorkas working with the Senate, Republican Democrats to actually solve problems at the border. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=847.48s)]
*  That was the dispute. They wanted to keep the border crisis alive for Donald Trump's candidacy. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=864.0s)]
*  But look, they were never going to be able to impeach Joe Biden because you've got 15 or so so-called Biden Republicans who represent districts that went for Joe Biden, even though they're represented by Republicans. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=870.76s)]
*  And those guys don't want to go anywhere near the fantasy production of this fake impeachment drive. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=884.76s)]
*  And so it was never going to happen. The impeachment of Mayorkas was just this little trinket of a consolation prize that they got instead. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=892.72s)]
*  And that also blew up in their face. And so, you know, one might hope that they would say to themselves, let's give up all of the nonsense, the impeachments and expulsions and censures and all of that. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=901.24s)]
*  Let's get back to work and try to make something happen. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  But unfortunately, Donald Trump, the fourth branch of government, vetoes it every time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=916.44s)]
*  Or the fifth branch of government, Vladimir Putin vetoes it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=921.12s)]
*  So they can't help the people in Ukraine. Putin doesn't want it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=924.36s)]
*  They can't solve the problem at the border with Democrats because Trump doesn't want it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=927.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, and Mike Johnson right now doesn't have the votes to bring anything to the floor or control the House whatsoever. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=931.4000000000001s)]
*  It's complete failed state. House of Representatives right now. Congressman Jamie Raskin, thank you very much. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=936.36s)]
*  Coming up, Donald Trump's sopranos-esque plan to make the RNC pay his giant legal tab. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=945.6s)]
*  But first, fireworks from Fonny Willis as the Georgia prosecutor fights back against Trump's lawyers. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=951.08s)]
*  That's next. If you're expecting some explosive moments in the criminal trials of Donald Trump, today in Atlanta was quite a day. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=957.36s)]
*  There was drama, there was yelling and none of it involved Trump. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=967.88s)]
*  Wasn't even there. The center of all this fire and fury, the person being scrutinized on the stand by multiple lawyers, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=971.88s)]
*  was the woman who is prosecuting Donald Trump. Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=977.76s)]
*  I object to you getting records. You've been intrusive into people's personal lives. You're confused. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=984.2s)]
*  You think I'm on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=989.44s)]
*  I'm not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=994.0s)]
*  So my question was, do you have any problem? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  I object to you getting any personal records of mine. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1000.32s)]
*  What was that? How did we get here? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1004.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, of all the criminal cases facing Donald Trump, the election racketeering case in Fulton County, Georgia seemed in many ways the most damning. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1006.88s)]
*  I mean, that was the one where Trump plotted to steal the state's electoral votes in 2020. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1015.6400000000001s)]
*  And crucially, in this case, there was Trump on tape literally telling the state's top election official to find him exactly the number of votes he needed to win. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1020.2s)]
*  There were four co-conspirators in that scheme who pled guilty and started cooperating with the prosecution. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1030.96s)]
*  But now the case is in complete jeopardy over allegations of misconduct by Willis, the DA who brought the case. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1038.4s)]
*  And that was the subject of today's hearings. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1044.16s)]
*  Lawyers for the defendants say Willis accepted favors and carried on an affair with a lawyer named Nathan Wade, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1046.44s)]
*  seen testifying there, who she then brought into work on the Trump prosecution. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1052.5600000000002s)]
*  Willis was on the stand today for just over two hours where she admitted to a romantic relationship with Wade, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1058.52s)]
*  but said it started after they were working together and ended last summer around the same time the Trump indictment came down. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1063.4s)]
*  The romantic relationship ended before the indictment was returned. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1075.48s)]
*  To a man, yes. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1078.0s)]
*  Well, to a man, yes. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  To you, no. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1081.64s)]
*  She's explained this, Mr. Saddam. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1082.72s)]
*  She's explained this. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1084.1200000000001s)]
*  And did the forthcoming indictment have anything to do with that? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1085.52s)]
*  Or was it just a coincidence? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1090.68s)]
*  Mr. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1094.2s)]
*  Let's go on and have the conversation. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm just asking you whether or not it was a coincidence. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1097.32s)]
*  It had absolutely nothing to do with this. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1099.32s)]
*  Willis arrived fired up, ready to parry with the defendants' lawyers. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1103.04s)]
*  People didn't know she was going to take the stand. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1106.2s)]
*  In fact, at one point she was ordered to the stand and the office objected and she was like, I want to talk. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1107.6s)]
*  And as those lawyers repeatedly asked probing questions about Willis' real intimate personal life, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1113.1599999999999s)]
*  they scrutinized her spending, her romantic and sexual habits, her trips, each and every place she lived, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1118.36s)]
*  which was quite a few, after she said her address was publicized and she began to receive threats from pro-Trump extremists. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1124.36s)]
*  And through it all, they demanded to know about her outside the office encounters with Wade. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1131.36s)]
*  Mr. Wade visits you at the place you laid your head. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1137.32s)]
*  When? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1140.28s)]
*  Has he ever visited you at the place you laid your head? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1141.0s)]
*  So let's be clear, because you lied in this. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1143.56s)]
*  Let me tell you which one you lied in. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1145.6399999999999s)]
*  Right here? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1146.76s)]
*  I think you lied right here. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1148.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1149.52s)]
*  This is the truth, Judge. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1150.2s)]
*  And it is a lie. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1151.2s)]
*  It is a lie. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1153.32s)]
*  Ms. Willis? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1154.32s)]
*  You see. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1155.04s)]
*  Mr. Sanon, thank you. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1155.52s)]
*  We're going to take five minutes. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1156.4399999999998s)]
*  Attorneys to the defendants came back again and again to the meals and the trips that Willis and Wade took together. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1158.52s)]
*  Your 2022 disclosure form did not list any of the thousands and thousands of dollars that Mr. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1165.84s)]
*  Wade paid for on trips that you were on. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1176.52s)]
*  Isn't that correct? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1181.4s)]
*  That's because Mr. Wade was paid that money back or he was paid due to the fact that I bought the plane ticket or I paid for the hotel. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1183.16s)]
*  There was never money that he gave me. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1193.64s)]
*  That wasn't the nature of our relationship. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1197.24s)]
*  So there are some serious questions here, maybe that Willis's answers are not satisfactory. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1200.48s)]
*  There is, at the very least, an appearance of impropriety. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1205.24s)]
*  But as you heard her say, she is not the one on trial. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1209.3200000000002s)]
*  Remember what this is, a racketeering case against Trump and 18 associates who were accused of conspiring to steal Georgia's 16 electoral votes away from their rightful [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1211.36s)]
*  winner, Joe Biden, but more importantly, away from the voters who voted for Joe Biden. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1220.1599999999999s)]
*  It is an unprecedented, unquestionably necessary case to press for the future of democratic elections in the United States. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1225.24s)]
*  What's mind blowing is that these searing, probing questions into the personal life of Trump's prosecutor could possibly sink that case. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1232.08s)]
*  Katie Fang is a host of the Katie Fang Show here on MSNBC, as well as an attorney. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  Melissa Redman is a University of Georgia law professor who actually worked in the Fulton County DA office with Fonny Willis. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1244.12s)]
*  They both join me now. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1249.8799999999999s)]
*  Katie, I'm going to start with you. You're down there. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1251.7199999999998s)]
*  You were covering it all day. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1253.36s)]
*  And before we get into some of the details here, I just want to I think I watched the whole thing not knowing what is the threshold legal question here. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1254.32s)]
*  What has to be demonstrated to get it over the line such that Fonny Willis is disqualified from this case? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1264.12s)]
*  What do they have to show for that to be the case? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1271.8s)]
*  And I'm grateful, Chris, for that question, because it is all about the law. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1276.7199999999998s)]
*  This was a legal proceeding that took place today, an evidentiary hearing in Georgia. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  The law is as follows to disqualify a prosecutor from a case. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1286.9599999999998s)]
*  You have to have an actual, not a speculative or theoretical conflict of interest. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1291.08s)]
*  When do you have that conflict of interest? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1295.84s)]
*  Well, for example, when a prosecutor has a personal financial stake in a defendant's conviction. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1297.52s)]
*  And so the defense has the burden in this case, Chris, to be able to prove through evidence, not through innuendo, not through salacious rumors about when affairs were had or not. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1303.92s)]
*  But evidence has to be entered into the record. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1314.32s)]
*  It cannot be hearsay. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1316.96s)]
*  It has to be firsthand eyewitness, firsthand testimony and evidence about what has occurred. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1318.04s)]
*  And the reason why I emphasize the law is because even though you even suggest that perhaps there's an appearance of impropriety, it doesn't make a difference unless there's an actual conflict of interest. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1324.68s)]
*  And the law in Georgia, Chris, actually says that married couples can be on opposing sides of a case and that in and of itself, to have that romantic relationship does not constitute disqualification. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1334.92s)]
*  The stakes couldn't be higher, though, Chris. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1347.6399999999999s)]
*  If D.A. Fonny-Willis is DQ'd off this case, her entire office in Georgia, that's the law, her entire office is off the case and it gets reassigned. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1349.28s)]
*  And so what the judge needs to do is determine the credibility of these witnesses. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  Who's lying? Who's telling the truth? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1363.36s)]
*  Who has the incentive to lie in this instance and apply his determination of those witnesses credibility and the facts and the evidence to the law in this case? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1365.1999999999998s)]
*  Melissa, let me ask you, someone who worked in this office and knows Fonny-Willis. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1374.32s)]
*  I mean, it was striking just at a sort of personal level to see her chomping at the bit to go defend herself today, even when, if I'm not mistaken, I think her office's lawyer objected to her sitting and she went in for two hours. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1377.44s)]
*  I'm just curious as someone who knows her, what you thought of that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1390.56s)]
*  Well, I have to clarify, I don't know her personally, but I have seen her in action and what we saw today was basically how I would see her in trial and basically ready for war. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1394.2s)]
*  She has had her integrity questioned. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1405.56s)]
*  She has had her decision making questions, sometimes her intelligence question as to why she made the decision she made as a duly elected prosecutor in one of the largest counties in Georgia. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1407.8799999999999s)]
*  And so you can imagine she is offended and she wanted to have an opportunity to tell her side of the story. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1418.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it's akin to a defense attorney telling their client, make the state prove their case, make them put up their evidence first before we decide whether or not you need to testify. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1426.4s)]
*  The attorneys, I'm sure, were saying, well, this motion to a disciplinary should be quashed. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1436.64s)]
*  You don't need to testify. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1441.16s)]
*  This is the phishing expedition. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1442.44s)]
*  But Ms. Willis apparently took the view that, no, they want to have this conversation that's happened. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1444.68s)]
*  And that's what we saw play out in court. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1450.3200000000002s)]
*  So let's get back to this again, this threshold legal question about a conflict of interest. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1452.6s)]
*  The allegation, Katie, by the defense, is that the sort of actionable conflict of interest here is what specifically? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1457.36s)]
*  Well, your guess is as good as mine, right? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1469.0s)]
*  Because if you really think about it, Chris, this is what the allegations are. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1470.76s)]
*  But I'm not really understanding it. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1474.04s)]
*  She hired her then boyfriend to be a special prosecutor so she could reap the financial or pecuniary benefits of that relationship. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1475.8s)]
*  And yet you've heard now Fonny Willis say under oath, she's her own woman. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1483.56s)]
*  She makes her own money. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1487.92s)]
*  She doesn't need to be a kept woman at the hands of Nathan Wade. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1489.04s)]
*  In fact, she gave him cash, cash that she was taught by her daddy to make sure she had so she could keep her independence and the financial independence that it merited. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1492.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think what's amazing here is that she's had to defend decisions that otherwise would be so personal and intimate that we never would know. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1501.92s)]
*  For example, special prosecutor Nathan Wade, Chris, today was the first time anybody heard, at least for those of us as Joe Q public, that Nathan Wade was battling cancer in 2020. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1509.6000000000001s)]
*  And that is the reason why he didn't venture out into places that wouldn't be sterile during a pandemic. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  We didn't need to know that Nathan Wade was battling cancer. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1526.64s)]
*  That kind of information should never have made it into public consumption. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1529.32s)]
*  And yet it did today. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1533.28s)]
*  And so what is this benefit that she derives if he makes it clear that even though he may have maybe reserved the tickets or booked the tickets, she compensated him fairly for it. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1534.76s)]
*  She made it clear, Chris, that there really is zero financial benefit she derived from that relationship with him. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1546.2s)]
*  Yeah, and just the most of the sort of this kind of the spectacle of it was was it felt like a kind of I mean, again, she is an elected leader and is subject to oversight. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1552.24s)]
*  So I don't want to like treat this with kid gloves like she's she serves the public. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  There's an allegation of impropriety. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1566.52s)]
*  This is a procedural hearing under Georgia law. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1567.88s)]
*  Watching it felt like this sort of tawdry public humiliation. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1571.96s)]
*  It was like a little like the Star Report or something. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1575.04s)]
*  Do you have the same feeling? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1577.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1579.56s)]
*  It was tawdry. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1580.4s)]
*  And I think one of the purposes would be a public humiliation because of the standard for disqualification in Georgia, even if they were in a relationship when she entered the contract, even if the money for the vacations weren't perfectly evenly split, you would still have to show that she spent two years investigating a case several months presenting it to both a special purpose grand jury and an indictment jury. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1581.3200000000002s)]
*  For the purpose of she did all of that because of this relationship and to benefit from these trips, these dinners or whatever you could say. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1610.88s)]
*  And when you think about the absurdity of having to show that actual conflict, that this relationship, whatever it was, whatever they did during the course of their personal lives was somehow for the purpose or somehow impacted. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1619.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1633.44s)]
*  Or not these accused were fairly indicted and whether this case is being prosecuted absent any personal relationships, the attorneys on either side may have. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1633.88s)]
*  Then it kind of brings home why are we doing this? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1646.64s)]
*  Why are we hearing all of these personal details from these attorneys? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1649.0400000000002s)]
*  As Miss Willis stated, are not on trial. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1652.7600000000002s)]
*  Katie Fang and Melissa Redmond, after just one of the strangest days I've seen in a courtroom, I have to say thank you so much for breaking that down. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1656.8s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1666.1599999999999s)]
*  Still ahead is Donald Trump appears in yet another New York courtroom today, the latest on the indicted ex president's plan to use the Republican Party as his personal piggy bank. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1669.3999999999999s)]
*  Next. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1679.24s)]
*  All right, so Donald Trump was in court again today as part of his New York criminal case. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1679.76s)]
*  And because it is nearly impossible, frankly, to keep track, this is the case of the criminal election interference conspiracy. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1685.4s)]
*  Trump participated in to get himself elected the first time back in 2016. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1692.0s)]
*  That's the one where he had an extramarital affair with an adult film actress, Stormy Daniels, while his third wife was at home with her newborn child. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1696.72s)]
*  And that's the one where he was in court again today. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1704.44s)]
*  And then he bribed Daniels with one hundred and thirty thousand dollars to stay quiet about it right before the election when he was reeling from the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1708.04s)]
*  Trump is now facing thirty four criminal counts as a result in New York court. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1717.56s)]
*  His trial will begin in little over a month on March twenty fifth. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1722.8s)]
*  And, you know, as we know, that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his legal laws. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1727.36s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's an overstatement to say there's not a single person on the planet right now, possibly, who is under more legal pressure than this man. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1732.04s)]
*  One of the things we are seeing develop is that his approach to all of this is endless delay, delay, delay. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1741.92s)]
*  And that can actually be a pretty effective and serious legal strategy. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1747.88s)]
*  There is a reason that most criminal defendants and litigants do not pursue it. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1751.12s)]
*  All of this law or lawyering costs a shocking amount of money. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1756.68s)]
*  Think about this, right? Right now, Trump is paying for lawyers in the New York criminal Stormy Daniels trial and the New York state civil fraud trial, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1761.24s)]
*  which is threatening the Trump organization with the corporate death penalty, as well as his second New York civil fraud trial, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1770.52s)]
*  in which he was found liable for defaming writer E.G. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1777.8400000000001s)]
*  Carroll, not a civil fraud trial, civil trial, liable for defaming writer E.G. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1780.96s)]
*  Carroll for the second time after a previous civil trial where he was also found liable for sexually abusing her. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1784.88s)]
*  The ex-president now needs to pay her eighty three million dollars, a verdict that he has pledged to appeal, but he's unlikely to prevail. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1792.2800000000002s)]
*  That's just one bucket. OK, the ex-president is also paying for lawyers in special counsel Jack Smith's federal twenty twenty election interference case [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1799.0400000000002s)]
*  and not just for the case, you know, the trial case, but his subsequent appeal all the way to the Supreme Court to get it thrown out on bogus immunity grounds. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1806.84s)]
*  Not only that, he's got lawyers defending him in the Colorado case. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1815.72s)]
*  Remember, that's the one that's trying to get him disqualified from the ballot under Section three of the 14th Amendment. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1819.32s)]
*  He's also appealing that his lawyers just argued in front of the Supreme Court. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1824.4399999999998s)]
*  That's expensive lawyer. Then there is Jack Smith's other federal criminal case stemming from, remember this, Trump's basically [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1827.84s)]
*  outright theft of classified documents and the other election interference case, the racketeering charges in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1836.4s)]
*  And to be clear, there's likely some overlap in these cases, but we don't know exactly how many attorneys currently represent the ex-president. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1845.0800000000002s)]
*  We know there are a lot of them and that there are lots and lots of billable hours costing lots and lots and lots of money. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1852.44s)]
*  In fact, last year alone, Trump spent over fifty two million dollars just on legal fees, according to one analysis. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1861.0s)]
*  Now, we know that, but we kind of know it because Trump is not actually footing the bill himself. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1868.3600000000001s)]
*  He has been raising huge amounts of money through his fundraising apparatus, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1873.56s)]
*  crowdsourcing a kind of legal slush fund from basically the devoted MAGA grandparents of America. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1877.3600000000001s)]
*  But at a certain point, that well is going to run dry and it's just the worst time, too, because if you think Trump has expensive fees now, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1883.96s)]
*  just wait until these criminal cases actually go to trial. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1891.3200000000002s)]
*  Think about the billable hours there. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1895.2s)]
*  Luckily for Trump, he has found the perfect entity to take over and use for legal fundraising. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1897.3200000000002s)]
*  And that is one of America's two major parties, the Republican National Committee. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1902.92s)]
*  You may have seen the recent news that despite her embarrassing and ethically degrading fealty to Donald Trump, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1907.48s)]
*  Ronna Romney McDaniel is set to be effectively kicked out of her position as head of the RNC. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1912.76s)]
*  It looks like she is going to be replaced by some diehard Trump loyalists, including his longtime supporter, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1918.12s)]
*  Michael Watley, currently the head of the North Carolina Republican Party, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1923.36s)]
*  Chris LaCivita, a longtime Republican operative whose current second in command on Trump's campaign [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1927.1999999999998s)]
*  and Trump's own daughter-in-law and former Fox News pundit, Lara Trump. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1933.08s)]
*  And they are not hiding in any way what the takeover means. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1937.52s)]
*  If I am elected to this position, I can assure you there will not be any more seventy thousand dollars. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1942.1599999999999s)]
*  Or whatever exorbitant amount of money it was spent on flowers. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1948.08s)]
*  Every single penny will go to the number one and the only job of the RNC. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1951.36s)]
*  That is electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1956.04s)]
*  The only job of the RNC that is electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1960.48s)]
*  There you have it. Straight from the woman named Trump, who is about to co-chair the committee. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1966.72s)]
*  The RNC is about to become Republican in name only, funding all that donated money [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1970.76s)]
*  to pay for Trump trials around the country instead of elections. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1975.32s)]
*  And they all know it. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1978.36s)]
*  As Politico reports, quote, I love this line, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1980.1200000000001s)]
*  Joining me now is someone who knows a thing or two about this, former RNC chair Michael Steele, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1992.2s)]
*  host of the new show The Weeknd, alongside my friend, Alicia Menendez and Simone Sanders. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=1996.0s)]
*  It's Saturday and Sunday morning right here on MSNBC and it's excellent viewing. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2000.56s)]
*  Good to have you here, Michael. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2004.84s)]
*  You guys are doing great work. I'm loving it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2006.1599999999999s)]
*  Thank you, man. Appreciate it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2007.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2008.6s)]
*  So my understanding is they've already paid a bunch of his legal bills in the past, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2011.84s)]
*  but they kind of made a distinction between what they would and wouldn't pay, basically. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2016.56s)]
*  And basically, we're like, we're not going to pay for your personal legal bills. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2022.2s)]
*  We'll pay for stuff that you were doing back when you were there. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2025.6s)]
*  But it seems that if he controls the committee, he can just get him to pay for anything? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2029.04s)]
*  Well, look, first off, I went broke just listening to you describing all of his legal problems. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2034.6s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2040.0s)]
*  That's a lot, number one. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2041.0s)]
*  Number two, you know, past is prologue. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2042.0s)]
*  And you already saw how they handled, as these cases and other issues were emerging during [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2046.3999999999999s)]
*  his four years, how the RNC was used financially, where resources were going, and how it impacted, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2052.16s)]
*  quite honestly, which is why they weren't winning elections in some critical states, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2060.0s)]
*  because they didn't have the resources to put on the ground, because those resources [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2064.76s)]
*  were largely diverted. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2068.52s)]
*  So here we are now. So here's the play. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2069.96s)]
*  If I want to take something over, what do I do? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2072.52s)]
*  I clear out the leadership. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2075.1200000000003s)]
*  So I take out the national chairwoman, and I put in, you know, a sycophant, a loyalist, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2077.1600000000003s)]
*  who primarily and fundamentally agrees that the election, the last election was stolen. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2083.76s)]
*  And so depending on that, and it's important, because if it gets re-elected, right, what [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2089.76s)]
*  that means is you now have in place some of the groundwork you're going to need to make [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2093.1200000000003s)]
*  the claims to relitigate the 2020 election. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2098.28s)]
*  But we can talk about that another time. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2101.2000000000003s)]
*  The second thing is you then put people who you are close with, family members, and close [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2102.7200000000003s)]
*  allies and associates, like La Servillada and Sevilla, and put them in charge of the [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2108.5600000000004s)]
*  day-to-day operations. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2114.4s)]
*  That's where the money comes in. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2116.2000000000003s)]
*  That's where the ground game really comes and is materialized for him. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2118.32s)]
*  The dollars come in. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2121.5600000000004s)]
*  They go out the door in other forms and fashions to pay for those bills as they come due. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2123.48s)]
*  And that, as Politico and other sources are noting, is a real problem going forward. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2128.36s)]
*  You know, the comparison I was making, there's a great Sopranos episode called The Bust Out. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2134.28s)]
*  In it, a guy who runs a sporting goods store gets into debt to Tony Soprano's gang from [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  a poker game. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2143.0800000000004s)]
*  And when he's in too deep, they take over his sporting goods store and they basically [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2144.64s)]
*  strip it there. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2148.6s)]
*  They take all the stuff, they start billing flight tickets on the accounts, right? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2149.88s)]
*  Let it go to collections. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2155.44s)]
*  And the guy, I mean, they basically just, it's a husk, right? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2156.6s)]
*  There's like, here's value. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2159.24s)]
*  And I just keep thinking of The Bust Out. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2160.72s)]
*  I'm thinking this is like, this is the RNC man and they're going to have their hands [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2162.56s)]
*  over it and he needs lots of money to keep this legal situation going. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  And you've already seen some of the impacts coming into this, Chris, because what did [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2169.64s)]
*  the RNC report at the end of 2023? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2173.0s)]
*  $8 million in the bank cash on hand going into a presidential cycle. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2175.92s)]
*  One of the two major national parties in America. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2181.84s)]
*  $8 million. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2184.8s)]
*  Now, the reality of that is that number is fine if you've just come off of an election [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2185.8s)]
*  cycle where you've had to spend a lot of money, right? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2191.92s)]
*  But you aren't. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2194.84s)]
*  It's 2023. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2195.84s)]
*  2023. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2196.84s)]
*  And not only that, that number is an $8 million number you have in January coming off of the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2197.84s)]
*  22 cycle, not in December, a year after that cycle is over. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2202.24s)]
*  So you're already seeing some problems internally with the ability to raise money. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2206.8799999999997s)]
*  And now you're going to couple that that whatever you do raise is already accounted for for [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2212.68s)]
*  Trump. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2216.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, the other thing is, we're seeing this, right? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  So her mission statement there, which is every dollar is to get Donald Trump elected, is [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2219.52s)]
*  at least honest, right? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2225.08s)]
*  But you know, this year's the Minnesota party. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2226.3199999999997s)]
*  This is the Minnesota GOP, which is basically broke after devastating 2022 election, Republicans [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2231.96s)]
*  were left reeling. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2237.08s)]
*  Some big donors threatened to leave the state. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2238.08s)]
*  At one point this year, the party had just $53 in cash on hand, hundreds of thousands [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2239.08s)]
*  of dollars in debt. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2243.48s)]
*  You got in Michigan right now. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2244.48s)]
*  You've got a Michigan's a hot mess right now. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2246.04s)]
*  Well, you've got to you got to have an on papacy problem. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  You've got two popes. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2250.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2251.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2252.6800000000003s)]
*  We're claiming both. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2253.6800000000003s)]
*  Pete Hoekstra is the new chair, according to a new Republican National Committee determination [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2254.6800000000003s)]
*  that the other one claiming to be the pope, Christina Caramo, is not. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2258.92s)]
*  She's about to fight. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2263.2000000000003s)]
*  You've got a Nevada. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2264.5s)]
*  You've got the head of the party who's indicted. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  But in all these places, they seem like financially and institutionally basket cases. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2267.76s)]
*  And presumably one of the things you would want the RNC to do would be to build them [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2271.8s)]
*  back up. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2275.92s)]
*  Well, that's an excellent point, because when I came into the RNC, one of the things [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2276.92s)]
*  I found this was your thing. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2279.8s)]
*  This was my thing was to put resources on the ground and got criticized for it. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2281.0400000000004s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I had state parties that had operationalized websites, because [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2284.6s)]
*  when I got there, 38 out of the 50 state parties didn't have a website. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2288.92s)]
*  So I spent six million dollars on things like that. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2293.88s)]
*  Now, this is where the RNC is today. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2296.56s)]
*  You're taking six out of eight million dollars to help a party organizations get up to speed [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2299.08s)]
*  for an upcoming cycle. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2303.7999999999997s)]
*  And the numbers just don't add up on that end. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2305.64s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2308.12s)]
*  The state parties themselves have begun to fracture. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2309.12s)]
*  As Michigan shows you the internal infighting and what does that do? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2312.96s)]
*  Donors don't give. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2316.88s)]
*  So, the major donors... [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2317.88s)]
*  Well, right, because who's it going to go to? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2318.88s)]
*  Right, who's it going to go to? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2319.88s)]
*  The major donors are like, oh, hell no, we're not writing the check. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2320.88s)]
*  And that's the Michigan problem. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2324.52s)]
*  That's the Nevada problem. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2325.94s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2326.94s)]
*  And others. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2327.94s)]
*  Yeah, this is going to be interesting to see how this plays out. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2328.94s)]

*  The astonishing story of one of the only black people to ever receive reparations for slavery [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2341.12s)]
*  and just how he did it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2346.3199999999997s)]
*  It's subject to Tremaine Lee's excellent new podcast. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2347.6s)]
*  And he joins me next. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2350.24s)]
*  For generations, black Americans have pushed for reparations, for compensation for the [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2355.3199999999997s)]
*  descendants of the enslaved people who built America. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2359.3599999999997s)]
*  The country has not made amends. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2362.58s)]
*  It has rebuffed those efforts. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2364.08s)]
*  And it's unclear if that will ever change. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2365.4s)]
*  The government has paid reparations for slavery before. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2368.12s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2370.76s)]
*  Back in 1862, the Compensated Emancipation Act ended slavery in the District of Columbia. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2371.76s)]
*  And as part of the act, the government paid out a million dollars in compensation, not [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2378.7200000000003s)]
*  to enslaved people, but to slaveholders. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2384.48s)]
*  Now in a fascinating new podcast series, MSNBC's Tremaine Lee explores the story of one of [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2388.4s)]
*  those people compensated by the 1862 act. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2393.76s)]
*  His name was Gabriel Coakley, and he was a black man. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2397.96s)]
*  He was a black man who bought the freedom of his enslaved relatives and then applied [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2400.6s)]
*  for that compensation under the law. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2405.68s)]
*  It's a remarkable story uncovered by his descendants and explored in this new series by Tremaine [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2408.2s)]
*  Lee, who examines what it means not just for the Coakley's family, but for the ongoing [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2413.68s)]
*  fight for reparations across the country. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2417.88s)]
*  Tremaine Lee, host of the Into America podcast, joins me now. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2420.28s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2423.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2424.76s)]
*  What a fascinating project. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2425.76s)]
*  As someone who thinks of himself as very well read on this period, this one, I saw your [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2427.2000000000003s)]
*  sketch of it and I thought, I've never heard of this story. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2434.32s)]
*  How did you find your way to it? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2436.8s)]
*  So first of all, there had been some news recently in recent years about the Compensated [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2437.98s)]
*  Emancipation Act, which actually paid reparations not to the enslaved, but former slaveholders. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2441.48s)]
*  That's already mind blowing enough. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2446.1200000000003s)]
*  And so we sit out to understand who those people were. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2447.76s)]
*  Who are these families, these white families who got paid? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2450.84s)]
*  Who got the reparations. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2452.84s)]
*  Who got the reparations. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2453.96s)]
*  And what happened to the black folks who had been enslaved? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2454.96s)]
*  And then what we discovered in our reporting, we have a great team of producers and researchers [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2457.6000000000004s)]
*  working with us. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2461.2000000000003s)]
*  We discovered that on this list of a thousand names, there were five black families, I'm [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2462.2000000000003s)]
*  sorry, six black families. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2466.52s)]
*  And one of those names that popped out, the first one to apply was Gabriel Coakley. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2468.0s)]
*  And so the Compensated Emancipation Act said, listen, if you paid for your human property, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2471.86s)]
*  we will reimburse you as a thank you for going along with emancipation. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2475.92s)]
*  That was Lincoln's big idea. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2480.2400000000002s)]
*  And so technically Gabriel Coakley purchased the freedom of his family and he kept receipts. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2482.84s)]
*  And whether it was an act of cunning or guile or strategy, he never registered them as free [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2488.1600000000003s)]
*  people. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2493.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2494.4s)]
*  So what he does is technically he's a slave owner because slavery is still legal. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2495.4s)]
*  Because they're still his property because he has not registered them as free, even though [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2498.2400000000002s)]
*  he owns them. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2501.2000000000003s)]
*  So he's not actually. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2502.2000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2503.2000000000003s)]
*  His wife, his sister, his six children, all technically slaves. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2504.2000000000003s)]
*  And so the Compensation Act, you know, arrives on their door and he says, you know what, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2507.48s)]
*  I'm going to try to get compensated. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2511.36s)]
*  And he does. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2512.36s)]
*  Now, we should note here because the context here, 1862 District of Columbia, this is right [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2513.36s)]
*  on the border of it's already, you know, between the north and the south. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2517.6000000000004s)]
*  This is where, you know, this whole war is going on. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2522.1600000000003s)]
*  There's this sort of question. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2525.52s)]
*  You know, one of the early iterations of abolition in the sort of milquetoast version was this [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2527.0s)]
*  thing called compensated manumission, right? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2532.36s)]
*  The idea that to avoid a war, to avoid the bloodshed, maybe the government will just [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2534.92s)]
*  pay the south and pay slaveholders for their, you know, for the people they enslaved. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2539.2s)]
*  And there was a point of great debate because on one hand, it kind of makes sense. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2543.68s)]
*  There's a lot of Confederate loyalty still in Washington, D.C. at this time. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2547.08s)]
*  You think about what's happening in Maryland. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2551.2799999999997s)]
*  There are a lot of old slaveholders. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2552.2799999999997s)]
*  But the idea was that if you pay them, they'll go along easily. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2554.4399999999996s)]
*  But for a lot of people, even admitting that these people were property, paying them kind [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2558.12s)]
*  of allows the idea that these humans were actually property, which goes against some [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2561.7999999999997s)]
*  of the moral concerns that people have with slavery in the first place. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2565.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. And most of the abolitionists hated this idea, we should say, at the time, both black and white. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2568.48s)]
*  Tell me about what happened to the Coakley family. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2572.88s)]
*  What's amazing is, you know, this is a story in so many ways about what could have been [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  the idea that black Americans would have been made whole after slavery ends. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2580.16s)]
*  At that moment, this is a moment. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2584.28s)]
*  There's an opportunity. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2585.8s)]
*  We think about General Sherman's 40 acres in the mule, the land and the mule that they [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2586.76s)]
*  would have gotten along the coast of the Carolinas. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2591.0s)]
*  What happens is, Gabriel Coakley gets this money and changes forever the trajectory of [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2592.96s)]
*  this family's life for generations. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2596.8s)]
*  We're talking about National Medal of Honor winners, academics, clergy, folks who had [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2598.92s)]
*  such a running start into what would have been this new freedom institution building. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2603.84s)]
*  This is the most amazing story never told. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2608.6000000000004s)]
*  And I stand by that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2611.28s)]
*  I'm so excited for people to finally hear this story. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2612.6400000000003s)]
*  It's so incredible because it's like this counterfactual that we don't ever get to test. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2614.88s)]
*  Right. I mean, when people talk about this, what we know is that the deprivations of [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2619.04s)]
*  slavery and the wealth of not just slave owners, white families, right, that there's [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2623.64s)]
*  a sort of accumulating effect that happens down through the generations. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2629.2s)]
*  And we know that as a historical matter. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2633.04s)]
*  Right. But this is like running some historical experiment where you go back and you [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2634.7599999999998s)]
*  change one variable and you say, well, what if we do change this variable? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2639.7599999999998s)]
*  What if we take a black family and we're just going to give them a little bit of those [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2643.4s)]
*  assets at this point in time? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2647.7599999999998s)]
*  What happens down the chain? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2649.3599999999997s)]
*  That's right. I'm trying not to give too much of this story away. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2650.8799999999997s)]
*  Because it's such an amazing story. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2653.4799999999996s)]
*  But Gabriel Coakley ends up being a property owner, buying and selling property. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2654.8399999999997s)]
*  He has a business is an oyster business. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2658.9199999999996s)]
*  So with some of that money, he ends up helping to co-found what is today the oldest black [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2660.72s)]
*  Catholic church in the city. He was a pillar in this community. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2664.9199999999996s)]
*  And so access to education. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2667.52s)]
*  Again, he was having fundraisers for religious schools and see for black children to [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2669.24s)]
*  attend forever, changing not just his family's lives, right, but that of the entire [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2673.0s)]
*  community again, experiencing this newness of freedom. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2677.72s)]
*  So how did you put this story together? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2680.72s)]
*  I mean, again, when I saw this, I was like, this is fascinating. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2683.0s)]
*  And I was like, well, you're not going to have any tape. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2685.36s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2687.4s)]
*  It's a tough it's a tough one to tell. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2688.56s)]
*  You know, a lot of the stories that we see historical podcasts, they're 1950, 1960, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2690.68s)]
*  1970, 1980. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2695.08s)]
*  You got lots of tape. You can play audio. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2696.48s)]
*  How'd you go about doing this? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2697.88s)]
*  So in two ways. One, we have the living descendants of Gabriel Coakley. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2698.76s)]
*  Right. So we have people who can attest to how they grew up in the stories they told. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2702.2s)]
*  But there's always this narrative about black people because we were considered [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2706.2s)]
*  property for so long that the historical record ends at some point. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2709.2s)]
*  But there are actually troves of documents, land sales, business deals all across this [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2712.64s)]
*  country in like dusty old basement archives that we explored from D.C. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2718.16s)]
*  to Louisiana, where it actually starts to these these narratives, these stories unfold [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2722.2400000000002s)]
*  before our eyes. We know how much he paid for who and when what was inherited, what [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2726.8s)]
*  was passed down. This story tells another American story. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2731.08s)]
*  It's really remarkable. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2734.56s)]
*  Actually, you can scan the QR code on your screen to listen to the first episode of [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2736.04s)]
*  Tremaine's new podcast series, Into America Presents. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2740.64s)]
*  The uncounted millions, the power of reparations is also available wherever you get [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2743.3199999999997s)]
*  your podcasts. Definitely check that out. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2748.2799999999997s)]
*  Tremaine Lee, it's always such a pleasure, man. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2750.24s)]
*  I'm really excited about this project. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IBbqL8WjCA&t=2751.72s)]
