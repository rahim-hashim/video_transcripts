# Michael Lewis raises the alarm on Trump’s plot to replace civil servants with loyalists
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E)
*  I think that what Trump should do, like if I was giving him one piece of advice, fire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=0.0s)]
*  every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=6.18s)]
*  them with our people. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=11.02s)]
*  And when the courts, because you will get taken to court, and then when the courts stop [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=12.02s)]
*  you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say the chief justice has [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=16.18s)]
*  made his ruling, now let him enforce it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=20.62s)]
*  That was Donald Trump's vice presidential pick nearly three years ago, laying out what [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=23.1s)]
*  is now understood to be a central part of the Project 2025 vision, purging the federal [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=27.54s)]
*  government independent expertise and replacing it with, in Vance's words, our people, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=32.24s)]
*  Corrupt pro-Trump loyalists. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=38.64s)]
*  Now Trump sort of tried something like this last time around. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=40.36s)]
*  He really did. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=42.72s)]
*  It was an effort that journalist Michael Lewis chronicled in The Fifth Risk, one of the greatest [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=43.72s)]
*  books about the Trump era. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=47.5s)]
*  And it outlines just how crucial that independent expertise is to not just the day-to-day function [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=49.42s)]
*  of the government, but for preventing catastrophes like, for instance, nuclear war. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=54.74s)]
*  Now in an upcoming piece for The Washington Post, Lewis pushes that theme forward by exploring [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  just how critical the unheralded work of the vast civil services, the very people Donald [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=64.1s)]
*  Trump wants to purge under Project 2025. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=68.6s)]
*  Michael Lewis, The Washington Post opinions guest writer. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=72.14s)]
*  His latest book, Going Infinite, about Sam Bankman Fried, is available now in paperback [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=74.56s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, Michael, I thought about The Fifth Risk when I got, A, when I saw the Project [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=81.18s)]
*  2025 section about the civil service and also when I first heard that J.D. Vance clip, because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  I think that book, more than any of it I've read, is sort of about just how sort of central [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=91.48s)]
*  and essential exactly that vast expertise basis is to running the entire country. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=97.68s)]
*  It's like one of the great untold stories of our era, the civil service. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=106.82s)]
*  I mean, it's what the president is supposed to be managing or at least not screwing up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=112.02s)]
*  And when you actually go in and ask what they do, when you don't just, you know, hand wave [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  and say deep state and all the rest, you find the most amazing stories. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not boring. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=126.69999999999999s)]
*  You know, it sounds boring. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=128.34s)]
*  And the people, they're people who are engaged passionately with, you know, subjects they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=130.22s)]
*  become obsessed with and solving problems that are just not going to be solved any other [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=134.9s)]
*  way than by this instrument. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=138.58s)]
*  And so for me, you know, I wrote The Fifth Risk. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=141.38000000000002s)]
*  I was kind of shocked by how great the material was and kind of shocked by how receptive the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=143.66000000000003s)]
*  audience was to it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=148.44000000000003s)]
*  So what we've done in The Washington Post starting Tuesday, there I've brought in six [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=150.22000000000003s)]
*  other writers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=155.22000000000003s)]
*  I like pick six writers I just loved. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=156.22000000000003s)]
*  And I said, here's the literary opportunity of your career. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=157.62s)]
*  And we have kind of parachuted them into the different parts of the federal government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=160.82s)]
*  And these pieces are going to run once a week up until the election. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=165.06s)]
*  And the writer, the only brief was the writer was told, go find something that interests [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=172.98s)]
*  And I swear to God, after about five minutes, they all came out and said, how did I not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=173.98s)]
*  know about this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=177.62s)]
*  Like, how did I not know these characters were as good as they are? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=178.62s)]
*  And so that's what this series is. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=182.28s)]
*  And I mean, I hope people will read it, because I think it's sort of the country needs a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  civics lesson. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=188.38s)]
*  Yeah. And that point about one thing that's come through when I've had opportunities to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  interact with folks who are sort of in the federal bureaucracy in different ways. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=195.34s)]
*  A lot of times, you know, again, these are people that are really take it seriously what [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=200.3s)]
*  they're doing, whether they're sort of checking hormone levels or they're they're doing soil [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=203.7s)]
*  erosion work or whatever it is like, they really are doing it because they care about [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=208.02s)]
*  it. And also, you just have no idea what their politics are. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=213.06s)]
*  You're talking like literally not. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  They could they could have whatever politics. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=218.38000000000002s)]
*  What they're focused on is doing the job. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=220.86s)]
*  And there's something so important about that and also so ominous to me about the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=222.9s)]
*  phrase our people as a like recipe for replacing that knowledge base with like who [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=228.74s)]
*  signs the loyalty card. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=234.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's exactly right, because you actually their politics are largely irrelevant. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=237.78s)]
*  They are dealing with problems that that no one else is is going to deal with. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=243.74s)]
*  And I think they're not even thinking of their politics. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=248.5s)]
*  And the other thing about them as a group, it's like the kind of people who are, I don't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=251.26s)]
*  know, my character, it's going to sound boring if I tell you about it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=257.78s)]
*  But when you read, you're not going to believe how great a character he is. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  I spent his entire career figuring out how to prevent coal mine roofs from falling on [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=264.06s)]
*  the heads of coal miners. A problem that you or I never thought about, but killed [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=267.82s)]
*  50,000 coal miners in the 20th century. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=271.66s)]
*  And it's like a huge, a huge deal. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=274.7s)]
*  And his audit is a 30 year odyssey. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=277.5s)]
*  And it's an incredible story. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=279.98s)]
*  But this guy, I'm not going to tell you his name. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  You can read about it. But this guy has never once asked for attention. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=284.58s)]
*  And it's like the opposite. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=287.66s)]
*  It's not just a Trump, obviously the opposite of Trump, but sort of the opposite of the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=289.3s)]
*  impulse in the in the person who stands up for it to run for office. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=293.46s)]
*  It's like it's not look at me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=296.98s)]
*  It's sort of the carrot in the school play. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  But they are but they're like the most important person here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=301.06s)]
*  And and the goal, my goal was just like, well, first, as I say, it was literary [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=303.82s)]
*  opportunism. The stories are so good. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=308.1s)]
*  But but it's sort of like like stop looking at the thing you're looking at all the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=310.26s)]
*  time and start paying attention to this, because this is I mean, this is critical. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  This is this is life or death stuff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  And and you need to know about it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=319.62s)]
*  You need to know about before you decide who you're going to vote for. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, one one thing that that points to when you talk about sort of opposite of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=324.86s)]
*  the person who sort of runs for office is that of all the things we think of that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=328.82s)]
*  person's job being, you know, the sort of some sort of symbolic role, right, where [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=334.06s)]
*  they they sort of channel the nation, they talk to the nation about stuff, the sort [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=339.86s)]
*  of proposer of legislation and budgets, the thing they are more than anything is the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=343.94s)]
*  boss at the top of the org chart that is all the people from SEAL Team six to the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=349.98s)]
*  guy that works on the problem of coal mines collapsing like that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=354.98s)]
*  That's literally what the job is. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=358.98s)]
*  Literally, the job is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  And if you have someone in the office who is just constantly abusing and insulting [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  the people, that can't be a recipe for successful management. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=368.14000000000004s)]
*  Right. I mean, we had an episode yesterday the day before when Trump went into the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=371.42s)]
*  military cemetery and and and tried to use it for his political agenda. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  He tried to use it for his political purposes, which is actually against the rules and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  got in that kerfuffle with it with the employee at the military cemetery that that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=382.22s)]
*  would no one ever no one said is that the person in the Department of Veterans Affairs [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=387.14s)]
*  who runs that that sacred part of our government, how we bury our our war dead, that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=392.38s)]
*  person turned it from a kind of only kind of well run thing into the best run [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=398.22s)]
*  organization in the country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=404.82s)]
*  It is there's a there's a an operation, the University of Michigan, that that rank [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=406.02s)]
*  sort of the consumer satisfaction or customer satisfaction of private and public [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=411.38s)]
*  institutions. And those people are are number one. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=415.34s)]
*  I mean, I have like Federal Express and know and it's like Trump's rolling in there and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  just kind of using it for his purposes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=423.9s)]
*  And it happens. And people say, oh, those people who do the work in the cemetery, their [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=425.74s)]
*  functionaries or bureaucrats know they are delivering a service that is a kind of sacred [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=429.38s)]
*  duty of the country and they're better at it than anybody like. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=434.26s)]
*  And we don't even know how that happened or why. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=437.98s)]
*  And I think, you know, this is like a failure of the of the citizen to understand the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=441.58s)]
*  government and that that's sort of what we need to step in and correct. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=446.82s)]
*  And these stories are so fun. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=450.3s)]
*  I'm hoping that everybody reads them and goes out. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=451.86s)]
*  I want to hear more about that because because really, it isn't just Trump that is a [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=453.46s)]
*  problem. It's like nobody's really telling the stories and people don't know they need [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=456.98s)]
*  to know them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=461.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'm psyched for this for this series that that's going to come out. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=464.26s)]
*  You know, one let me ask you this is a final question. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=468.58s)]
*  One way I think you can interpret this, I think this is true a little bit, I'll say in [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=471.7s)]
*  New York City governance. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=475.58s)]
*  So New York City has its own version of this and actually has an incredible civil service [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=476.53999999999996s)]
*  at the sort of municipal level. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=480.14s)]
*  There's all sorts of amazing people with expertise doing stuff and running the subways [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=481.42s)]
*  and public health. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=484.62s)]
*  And and one thing you could say and I'd like to get your responses is like, look, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=485.98s)]
*  because that repository of expertise is so good, because there's institutional [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=490.14000000000004s)]
*  vibrancy and resilience, you know, if you get a Trump, it's all right. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=495.18s)]
*  It'll pass. They'll be fine. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=500.82s)]
*  They're sort of cordoned off. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't matter that much because of, quote, the sort of deep state, basically, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=503.66s)]
*  right? Some some sort of permanent governing apparatus, which is immune to it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=508.38s)]
*  And what do you think about that notion? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  False, because the first thing he wants to do is politicize the civil service, is [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=515.5s)]
*  remove the civil services ability to protect itself from the politicians and make [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=519.46s)]
*  them all political appointees. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  We already have a little bit of a problem that too many of our our people in the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=525.38s)]
*  federal government are political appointees. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=528.6600000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. The number he wants to make it a patronage. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=530.34s)]
*  Too many. Yes. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=533.0600000000001s)]
*  Taking it back to like the 19th century. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  So that that will make it very hard for things to get done well. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=535.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Do you want the guy inspecting the fire safety codes to be someone who [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=541.5s)]
*  really knows about fire safety or like, you know, he was Mayor Daley's buddy? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  It's like basically the question or Mary Daley's neighbor. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=550.86s)]
*  That's that's that's what we're looking at. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=555.6999999999999s)]
*  Michael Lewis, whose book Going Infinite is now out in paperback. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=557.2199999999999s)]
*  We'll look for that series in The Washington Post will be coming up the next few weeks. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=560.54s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4d4nFtQ3E&t=563.26s)]
