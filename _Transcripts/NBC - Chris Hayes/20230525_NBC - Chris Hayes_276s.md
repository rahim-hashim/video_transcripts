# ‘Literal dumpster fire’: Infighting erupts among Texas Republican leaders
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM)
*  In the second most populous state in the country, Texas, there's this weird mismatch between the 30 million citizens and their political leadership. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=0.0s)]
*  The government is just solid deep red. Republicans hold majorities in both houses of legislature. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=8.28s)]
*  They control every statewide office and the state Supreme Court. And it's been this way for nearly 30 years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=13.72s)]
*  But the citizens of Texas are nowhere near as homogenous. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=19.28s)]
*  In fact, the state is trending towards the Democrats, the left shifting nearly eight points towards Democrats in just the past decade. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=22.72s)]
*  And we have seen some close races, famously that Senate race in 2018 when better or work came within three points of unseating Ted Cruz. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=30.24s)]
*  But as of yet, that Democratic shift and we've seen it in the presidential level has not been big enough to change much of anything in Texas state politics. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=38.36s)]
*  So elected Republicans that state have long faced essentially zero political accountability. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=46.0s)]
*  And that generally, as a general matter, leads to widespread corruption and misconduct. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=51.4s)]
*  Let's take Republican state Representative Brian Slayton. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Remember that guy? So called family values conservative, led the charge on anti LGBTQ legislation describing drag performers as perverted adults. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=59.6s)]
*  Well, an internal investigation just determined that 45 year old Slayton had sex with his 19 year old aide after getting her drunk. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=69.16s)]
*  Now, to their credit, after a solemn, sometimes angry and tearful recounting of Slayton's graphic and offensive behavior, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=77.04s)]
*  the Texas House voted to expel him 147 to zero, making him the first member of the Texas legislature to be removed from office nearly a century. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  Just gives you some of the idea of some of the characters who make up the Republican caucus in the Texas state ledges. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Quite a crew. Then you have the attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, who was just reelected to a third term after attempting to overturn the 2020 election, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  suing the Biden administration over and over, joining the effort to ban abortion medication. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  In his eight years in office, Paxton has faced multiple criminal investigations, including a 2015 indictment on felony securities fraud. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=112.92s)]
*  In 2020, senior members of this guy's own office came forward alleging he committed bribery, abusive office and other potential crimes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=120.84s)]
*  The Department of Justice is investigating those claims. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=129.04s)]
*  Then some of those aides who came forward to blow the whistle were fired and subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging improper retaliation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=132.28s)]
*  Earlier this year, Paxton settled with the whistleblowers for three point three million dollars, money he asked the legislature to give him out of taxpayer funds. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  And now these two Republican led branches of Texas government have a beef that is exploding out into the open. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=149.76s)]
*  The House, particularly the speaker, Dade Phelan, does not want to give Paxton that money. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=157.44s)]
*  So they launched an investigation into the attorney general accusing him of committing multiple crimes, including felonies at a hearing yesterday. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=163.0s)]
*  Paxton immediately fired back, accusing Speaker Phelan of being drunk on the job and calling on him to resign. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=170.12s)]
*  And again, to be fair to Paxton here, something did sound off the other day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=176.24s)]
*  Mr. Campbell, the amendment is acceptable to the author. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=183.36s)]
*  Is there objection to the opposite amendment? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=186.88s)]
*  The chair has done the amendment. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=189.36s)]
*  The amendment is adopted. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=190.4s)]
*  The chair recognizes Mr. Johnson of Harris. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=192.88s)]
*  Mr. Johnson of Harris to speak in opposition to the bill. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=198.08s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=203.84s)]
*  Now to top it all off, just hours after that hearing, where investigators ordered Paxton to preserve documents and evidence related to the accusations against him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  A literal dumpster fire broke out at his office. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=214.16s)]
*  Paxton initially released this video referring to it as a case of arson. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=217.2s)]
*  Today, he announced a suspect has been arrested with charge with criminal mischief and a preliminary investigation concluded the fire was accidental. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=220.56s)]
*  But it looks like the House has the upper hand. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=228.88s)]
*  The investigating committee just formally recommended that Ken Paxton be impeached for his potential crimes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=230.56s)]
*  If the impeachment is successful and one Democratic lawmaker says they do have enough votes, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  Paxton would be required to step down from his post temporarily while facing trial in the state Senate, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=242.16s)]
*  which would mean maybe finally some accountability is coming for Ken Paxton and Texas Republicans. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FrWdYpLpM&t=247.68s)]
