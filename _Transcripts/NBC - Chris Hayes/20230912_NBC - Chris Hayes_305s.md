Video Description: Chris Hayes on Kevin McCarthy: "He probably right now does not have the votes to either pass a must-pass spending bill or to get a House vote on impeachment. He's got the votes for neither, and he's trying to pull off a miracle—in the meantime alienating both sides of his party."

# Hayes: McCarthy's impeachment push, spending fight will alienate all sides of GOP
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys)
*  Kevin McCarthy is not a complicated dude. People who cover him or know him will really not dispute that fact. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=0.0s)]
*  There's no deep political strategy behind what he does, nor does there appear to be particularly zealous ideological motivation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=6.0s)]
*  Right now, Kevin McCarthy wants to stay in power as Speaker of the House. He likes that job. He wants to be the Speaker. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=14.0s)]
*  He will do whatever it takes to accomplish those goals. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=19.0s)]
*  And partly we know this because back in 2016, when no one thought Donald Trump was going to take over the Republican Party, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=22.0s)]
*  this is what the same Kevin McCarthy had to say about him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=27.0s)]
*  He begins by saying, I'll guarantee you that's what it is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=32.0s)]
*  The Russians hacked the DNC and got the op research that they had on Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=36.0s)]
*  And then McCarthy laughs. McCarthy then adds, there's two people I think Putin pays, Rohrbacher and Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=41.0s)]
*  There's then laughter by some of the lawmakers in the room. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=50.0s)]
*  And then McCarthy adds, swear to God. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=53.0s)]
*  But then Trump won, and it became clear to the likes of McCarthy and every other Trump skeptic in the party that proximity to him was crucial for retaining power. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=56.0s)]
*  In one particularly telling example, while having dessert on Air Force One, McCarthy noticed Trump was eating only red and pink Starburst candies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=65.0s)]
*  So he bought a bag and he had an aide pick out only those two flavors and then delivered them in a jar to Donald Trump in the White House with his own name on it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=74.0s)]
*  For what it's worth, Trump was reportedly giddy with this gesture, I can imagine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=83.0s)]
*  That is the kind of stuff Kevin McCarthy is willing to do to ingratiate himself to the source of power in Republican politics. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=88.0s)]
*  So today, McCarthy announced he is getting to work plucking Donald Trump's red and pink Starbursts out of the bowl in a far more dangerous and craven fashion by endorsing the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden that the ex-president has been [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=95.0s)]
*  loudly demanding, including apparently at a dinner with McCarthy's top adviser, Marjorie Taylor Greene, over the weekend. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=109.0s)]
*  It's obvious why Greene and her folks want impeachment. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=116.0s)]
*  But isn't it obvious what they think it should be for? Like think about like the one sentence description. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=122.0s)]
*  In 1868, Andrew Johnson was impeached because he defied Congress and sabotaged reconstruction after the Civil War. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=127.0s)]
*  In 1998, Bill Clinton was impeached because he had a sexual affair with an intern and then lied about it under oath. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=134.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was impeached twice, once in 2020 for using the power of his office to extort the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on his political opponent. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=140.0s)]
*  A second time in 2021 for inciting a deadly riot at the Capitol on January 6. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=149.0s)]
*  What's the one sentence version of this one? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=154.0s)]
*  We don't know why Joe Biden is the subject of impeachment inquiry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=157.0s)]
*  No Republicans been able to describe it so succinctly. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=161.0s)]
*  That said, the political math of this is not hard to understand. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=164.0s)]
*  You see, McCarthy has a five vote margin in the House. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=167.0s)]
*  He's got a faction in his conference that is devoted to Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=170.0s)]
*  He probably right now does not have the votes to either pass a must pass spending bill or to get a House vote on an impeachment inquiry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=174.0s)]
*  So he's got the votes for neither and he's trying to pull off a miracle by like combining them to get the votes for one maybe. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=183.0s)]
*  In the meantime, alienating all sides of his party. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=190.0s)]
*  So today he announced an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden without a vote, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=193.0s)]
*  something he strenuously objected to back when the Democrats controlled the House, in fact introduced a congressional resolution opposing it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=197.0s)]
*  And he's doing this ridiculous exercise again without a vote, hoping that that will help him get the votes he needs to pass the must pass funding bills and keep the government open. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=204.0s)]
*  So far, I'm not sure that's working. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=215.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=218.0s)]
*  The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate total compliance or remove you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=226.0s)]
*  Now that guy's bark to bite ratio is like 10000 to one. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=235.0s)]
*  So it would take too much stock there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=239.0s)]
*  But McCarthy in trying to do this thing, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=242.0s)]
*  Like I'll give you the impeachment inquiry. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=244.0s)]
*  Give me the votes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=245.0s)]
*  It's like a guy who loans a ton of money and a loan sharks after him and it's up against the deadline. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=246.0s)]
*  So he goes to a second loan shark to take another loan to pay off the first loan shark. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=252.0s)]
*  Maybe you get through today and you wake up tomorrow. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=257.0s)]
*  But eventually it's all going to come due. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=260.0s)]
*  Right now, the idea that is politically advantageous to go along with impeaching Joe Biden is belied by the fact that McCarthy doesn't have the votes to do it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=265.0s)]
*  He doesn't have the votes to open an inquiry. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=274.0s)]
*  And the reason he doesn't is because the very swing district Republicans he needs on his side for such a vote understand the politics are terrible. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDhoHHm4Ys&t=276.0s)]
