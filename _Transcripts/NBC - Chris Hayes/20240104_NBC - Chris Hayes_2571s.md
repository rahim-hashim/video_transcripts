# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 4  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA)
*  Tonight on All In. Epstein hung out with some of the most well-connected people on earth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Republican frontrunner and the Jeffrey Epstein docs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=7.84s)]
*  She said she was once flying on Epstein's plane and they made an unstopped, an unplanned [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=11.78s)]
*  stop in Atlantic City because Jeffrey said, great, we're going to call up Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=17.0s)]
*  Tonight, new unsealed documents and what we already know about Donald Trump and Jeffrey [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=21.36s)]
*  Epstein. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=26.0s)]
*  I do not think it is right and fair for this administration's labor department to have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=27.72s)]
*  Epstein as the focus. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=33.64s)]
*  Then move over Hunter Biden. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=35.56s)]
*  There have been any accusations that Donald Trump got paid by China. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=39.44s)]
*  Brand new accusations that Donald Trump got paid by China while he was president. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=43.6s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin joins me live with his new bombshell report. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=48.6s)]
*  Plus, the Biden campaign drops their first ad. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  All of us are being asked right now, what will we do to maintain our democracy? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=56.4s)]
*  But can the call to save democracy break through MAGA propaganda? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  When All In starts right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=66.2s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=73.12s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=74.12s)]
*  In the last 24 hours, more than a thousand pages of newly unsealed documents from a case [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=75.12s)]
*  involving a disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein were released [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=79.68s)]
*  to the public. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=84.88s)]
*  They were unsealed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=85.88s)]
*  That includes about 300 in just the past few hours, which we've been sifting through here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=86.88s)]
*  And journalists both in our news organization and all over have been pouring over those [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=91.28s)]
*  documents. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  And I have to say, so far we've not learned much that we did not already know. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  Despite the tantalizing promise, there would be some big reveal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=99.96s)]
*  For instance, we know that Epstein actively cultivated relationships with powerful men [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=103.8s)]
*  and in some cases women in prominent institutions, from government to finance to academia to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=107.88s)]
*  philanthropy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=113.0s)]
*  We know that Epstein trafficked and sexually abused young women and girls. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=114.28s)]
*  We know he owned a private island in the Caribbean where some of this abuse took place and that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=118.9s)]
*  he flew some of those same rich men he cultivated relationships with there on his private jet. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=123.12s)]
*  But the lack of some big bombshell revelation in the new documents has not stopped Fox News [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=129.86s)]
*  and others in right wing media from going absolutely all in on this story. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=135.56s)]
*  And while information about Epstein and the horrible things he did to his victims is absolutely [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=142.0s)]
*  newsworthy, we've covered it on the show quite a bit, the extent to which Jeffrey Epstein [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=146.92s)]
*  has become a kind of totem among a certain sort of conspiratorial right wing politics [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=153.32s)]
*  is both fascinating and quite instructive to me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=158.66s)]
*  To some on the right, Jeffrey Epstein is the skeleton key that unlocks the Illuminati and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=163.12s)]
*  the secret cabal of child sex traffickers that the proverbial they don't want you to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=168.68s)]
*  know about. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=173.24s)]
*  And with that comes a host of cascading associated conspiracies about everything from vaccines [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=174.68s)]
*  to cell phone towers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=179.52s)]
*  And to be quite clear here, it really is the case that Jeffrey Epstein was a mesh in the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  upper echelons of American society in a totally disgusting and shameful way. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  That reality, though, is sort of the bedrock for what's built atop it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=193.12s)]
*  And that is built atop it is an obsession with him that has transcended those basic [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=198.96s)]
*  facts in a way that gets tied up with a whole number of other right wing fever dreams. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  We actually saw just a perfect example of this a couple days ago when Aaron Rodgers, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=208.8s)]
*  the broken down NFL quarterback and vaccine conspiracy peddler, went on an ESPN program [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  that he's paid to go on and baselessly smeared late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel as one of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=218.6s)]
*  Epstein's associates. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=225.6s)]
*  It's got something to do with the Epstein list that came out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=226.6s)]
*  Feels like it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=230.2s)]
*  Feels like it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=231.2s)]
*  That's supposed to be coming out soon. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=232.2s)]
*  That's supposed to be coming out soon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=233.2s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=234.2s)]
*  He's been waiting in his wine cellar. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=235.2s)]
*  I've been waiting in my wine cellar for this thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=236.2s)]
*  There's a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, that are really hoping that doesn't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=237.2s)]
*  happen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=240.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=241.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=242.2s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of people are hoping that doesn't happen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=243.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, a clip from this particular program was run on Jimmy Kimmel's show. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  Whenever Aaron brought up the list and then Jimmy mocked him for it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=252.64s)]
*  Aaron has not forgotten about that, but here we are sitting right in front of that nice [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=257.0s)]
*  bottle of scotch. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=260.88s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=261.88s)]
*  I'm waiting to celebrate something. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=262.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=263.88s)]
*  Something awesome. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=264.88s)]
*  He's been waiting for that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=265.88s)]
*  That's the one. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=266.88s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=267.88s)]
*  If that list comes out, I definitely will be popping some sort of bottle. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=268.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers, who's sort of deep in this conspiracist world, who's done incredible [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=274.88s)]
*  amounts of actual tangible damage with his vaccine denialism. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, huge amounts. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=281.24s)]
*  Sitting there like this big moment, this big reveal. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=283.16s)]
*  The secret cabal is going to be revealed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=286.24s)]
*  Maybe Jimmy Kimmel's on the list. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=289.0s)]
*  Now, Jimmy Kimmel did not appreciate being smeared in that way. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  The late night host, who we must stress has zero connection to Epstein, was not in the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=295.06s)]
*  documents released, lit into Rodgers on social media and threatened to take him to court. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=299.7s)]
*  And the very next day, the host of that program had to go on TV and try to clean up Aaron [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=304.38s)]
*  Rodgers mess. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=309.46s)]
*  I can see exactly why Jimmy Kimmel felt the way he felt, especially with his position. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=311.86s)]
*  But I think Aaron was just trying to talk s***. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=315.46s)]
*  Now, did it go too far? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=317.14s)]
*  And a lot of people, Jimmy Kimmel certainly said that was the case. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=318.82s)]
*  We and I immediately potted happening, trying to be like, you know, but that is Aaron and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=322.86s)]
*  Jimmy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=327.34s)]
*  Abba da ba da ba da ba da ba da ba da. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  That is just one example of the way that Epstein conspiracies are sort of weaponized, this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  kind of all purpose tool against the conspiratorial rights perceived enemies, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=336.85999999999996s)]
*  And I have to say, it is really just so unbelievable that Fox News, Republicans, conservatives have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=342.17999999999995s)]
*  made Jeffrey Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein, the focal point of their worldview about who the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  bad guys are in society. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  Because let's just look at the facts here. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=355.17999999999995s)]
*  The guy in American politics most closely associated with Epstein and particularly Epstein's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=358.14000000000004s)]
*  scandals is, I think, inarguably Donald Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=363.54s)]
*  Back in 2019, when Epstein was arrested for sex trafficking charges, there was renewed [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=369.98s)]
*  interest in his past misdeeds, including crucially that he had been nailed for this before and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=374.62s)]
*  had pled guilty in 2008 for what prosecutors called soliciting an underage prostitute. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  But it was that subsequent, that sweetheart deal that Epstein received as a result that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=386.26s)]
*  became an issue. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  The highly unusual plea agreement allowed billionaire hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=394.18s)]
*  to spend a mere 13 months in county jail when the federal government may have had enough [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  evidence to put him in prison for life. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=405.14s)]
*  This according to police and prosecution documents obtained by NBC News. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=407.86s)]
*  And tonight, there's a new focus on the prosecutor who helped arrange that deal a decade ago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=413.06s)]
*  Now the secretary of labor. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=419.42s)]
*  OK, remember this? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=421.26s)]
*  The number one example of the elite lack of accountability for this guy, Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=423.1s)]
*  is the fact that a U.S. attorney hammered out this plea deal that was just unheard of, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=431.42s)]
*  that just basically let him get away with it and then go back to reoffending. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=437.26s)]
*  The guy that gave him that deal, Donald Trump appointed him, Alex Acosta, in his cabinet. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=440.98s)]
*  The guy who gave the Epstein deal. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=446.74s)]
*  He got a cabinet position because he was appointed by Donald Trump. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=448.42s)]
*  And it was a big scandal at the time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=451.94s)]
*  Acosta ultimately resigned in 2019 amid renewed interest in the Epstein case, although he [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=453.22s)]
*  defended the plea deal until the end. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=458.7s)]
*  A lengthy investigation from Trump's Department of Justice ultimately found that Acosta exhibited [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=461.38s)]
*  poor judgment, although it cleared him of any official misconduct. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=465.86s)]
*  Now, around the time that Epstein was negotiating that deal, the one that basically allowed [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=470.42s)]
*  him to more or less get away scot-free and go back to reoffending, he was represented [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=474.7s)]
*  by a number of high profile attorneys, including former counsel O.J. Simpson, Alan Dershowitz [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=479.14000000000004s)]
*  and former Bill Clinton investigator, Ken Starr. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=483.98s)]
*  You may remember those two men for a different reason. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=487.94s)]
*  Back in 2020, Donald Trump brought both of them on to assist his legal defense during [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=490.8s)]
*  his first impeachment trial. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  Get me the Epstein defense team. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=498.5s)]
*  We should note both men have defended their actions as Epstein's lawyers. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=501.22s)]
*  Dershowitz also declined to comment to NBC News about these new Epstein documents. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=504.86s)]
*  And not long before that impeachment trial that they defended him in, remember, Jeffrey [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=509.74s)]
*  Epstein famously died in federal custody in a federal detention center here in New York [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=514.3s)]
*  City. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=520.18s)]
*  That, that was the incident that sparked countless Epstein didn't kill himself memes that went [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=521.18s)]
*  in the conspiratorial part of the Internet. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=527.08s)]
*  It transformed the sex offender into the current status of kind of fulcrum of right-wing conspiracy [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=529.32s)]
*  theories worldwide. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=535.16s)]
*  Now investigators later said Epstein was not killed, that it was in fact a suicide, and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=536.52s)]
*  that it occurred amid quote, significant mixed conduct at the federal prison. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=541.92s)]
*  A federal prison under the purview of the Department of Justice, which at the time was [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=546.28s)]
*  run by, let me see if I have this right here. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=550.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, Trump's attorney general Bill Barr. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  Bill Barr called Epstein's death a perfect storm of screw ups. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=557.36s)]
*  Sort of a passive way to describe a debacle that happened under your authority. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=561.24s)]
*  So Donald Trump's Justice Department was overseeing Jeffrey Epstein when he died in prison. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=567.4s)]
*  Of course the real link here is the personal relationship between Donald Trump and Epstein [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  himself, the one you see on your screen right now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=577.12s)]
*  Trump has denied any connection to Epstein's crimes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=581.16s)]
*  He declined to comment to NBC News about these new documents, but it's undeniable, just an [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=583.68s)]
*  established fact, the two men were once friendly. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=587.72s)]
*  Back in 1992, before Epstein's first arrest, the two men were captured on video partying [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=591.4s)]
*  at Trump's Mar-a-Lago golf home and crucially, leering at women together. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=596.48s)]
*  One decade later, Trump went on the record with New York Magazine to praise Epstein in [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=602.76s)]
*  these words and I will quote them. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=607.28s)]
*  I've known Jeff for 15 years. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=609.24s)]
*  Terrific guy. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=611.52s)]
*  He's a lot of fun to be with. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=613.04s)]
*  It is even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=614.52s)]
*  side. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=621.76s)]
*  No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=624.0s)]
*  That's a hell of a quote, isn't it? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=627.48s)]
*  About a guy who we would later find out was trafficking girls, sexual abuse. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=631.76s)]
*  And though Trump later claimed he and Epstein out of falling out, his well wishes didn't [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=638.2399999999999s)]
*  end there, okay? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=642.2399999999999s)]
*  Just listen to how Donald Trump responded from the White House briefing room after being [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=644.2399999999999s)]
*  asked about Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=648.0s)]
*  I don't know, I haven't really been following it too much. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=652.5999999999999s)]
*  I just wish her well, frankly. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=655.0s)]
*  I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=657.16s)]
*  I guess they lived in Palm Beach, but I wish her well. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  I wish her well. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=668.68s)]
*  This is the one. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=669.68s)]
*  They had just had the Alex Acosta scandal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=670.68s)]
*  Everyone knows what happened with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump as president from the podium says, oh yeah, I knew her socially, wish her [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=677.0s)]
*  well, rooting for her, hope she's doing fine. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  Again, to be clear, at the time, Ghislaine Maxwell was in prison after being charged [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=682.8399999999999s)]
*  federally with conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=686.4799999999999s)]
*  But even when given the opportunity to walk those comments back, Trump refused. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=691.64s)]
*  Her friend or boyfriend was either killed or committed suicide in jail. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=696.72s)]
*  She's now in jail. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=702.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wish her well. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=703.2s)]
*  I'd wish you well. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=704.2s)]
*  I'd wish a lot of people well. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=705.2s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  Let them prove somebody was guilty. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you do know that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=709.6s)]
*  Oh, so you're saying you hope she doesn't die in jail. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  Is that what you mean by wish her well? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=712.32s)]
*  Her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out how did it happen? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=713.88s)]
*  Was it suicide? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=718.0600000000001s)]
*  Was he killed? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=719.0600000000001s)]
*  And I do wish her well. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=720.36s)]
*  Two things here that are important. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=721.84s)]
*  One is you can see the parts of the Internet and the media world that Trump gets his own [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=723.16s)]
*  information from. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, remember, this guy's the president who directs the Department of Justice, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  That report to him that had Epstein in custody. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=733.26s)]
*  Like maybe someone killed him. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=736.04s)]
*  Maybe he died. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=737.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=738.36s)]
*  We should also note that they did prove somebody was guilty. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=739.92s)]
*  Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted by a jury on those charges as serving a 20-year sentence [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=744.24s)]
*  in prison. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=749.12s)]
*  But of course, the facts, you know, I mean, I'm banging my head against the wall here. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=751.08s)]
*  I know full well the facts don't matter to the conspiracy crowd. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=755.96s)]
*  These are the type of folks who engage in what has become quite clearly a kind of watered [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=759.24s)]
*  down QAnon talking point. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=763.88s)]
*  Promote anti-vaccine nonsense. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=768.08s)]
*  Things are all false flags, right? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=770.12s)]
*  It's the kind of world, and particularly the kind of voters in short, who seem most drawn [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=772.12s)]
*  to support conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for president. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=777.42s)]
*  You weren't ever on Jeffrey Epstein's jet, were you? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=783.38s)]
*  I was on Jeffrey Epstein's jet two times. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=787.9799999999999s)]
*  I was on it in 1993. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=790.9399999999999s)]
*  And I was on it and I went to Florida with my wife and two children to visit my mom over [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=795.2199999999999s)]
*  Easter. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=806.38s)]
*  My wife had some kind of relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell and they offered us a ride [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=808.26s)]
*  to Palm Beach. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=814.5799999999999s)]
*  So I went then and on another occasion I flew again with my family with, I think, four of [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=815.5799999999999s)]
*  my children and married my wife to Rapid City, South Dakota to go fossil hunting. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=821.66s)]
*  You were on Epstein's jet, well, I mean, twice, you know, with my family. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=834.74s)]
*  Once to go fossil hunting, but aside from that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=837.7s)]
*  Now Kennedy denies any wrongdoing. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=840.5s)]
*  He's not been accused of any misconduct, to be clear, because, you know, lots of people, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=842.38s)]
*  it seems again, this is part of what sort of makes the scandal so tantalizing for you, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=846.38s)]
*  right? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=850.0600000000001s)]
*  Lots of people flew on Epstein's private jet, including former President Bill Clinton. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=851.0600000000001s)]
*  That's also established and well known. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=854.86s)]
*  But again, to the conspiracist crowd that traffics almost exclusively in loose connections in [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=857.3s)]
*  it should presumably be relevant that two of the three most prominent candidates for [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=862.5s)]
*  president of the United States of America have tangible connections to Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=867.62s)]
*  In fact, if you at home watching this are something of a single issue anti Epstein voter, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=872.9s)]
*  there's only one major candidate for president without any meaningful ties to Epstein. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=878.74s)]
*  His name's Joe Biden. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=882.3s)]
*  Keep that in mind the next time Fox News tries to use Epstein to smear the left. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=884.42s)]
*  Brandi Zadrazny is a senior reporter for NBC News. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=890.06s)]
*  She investigates QAnon type conspiracy theories and the people who push them. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=892.26s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg is an opinion columnist for the New York Times and they both join [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=895.6199999999999s)]
*  me now. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=898.54s)]
*  I truly find it remarkable this jujitsu they have pulled off this story. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=899.54s)]
*  And I want to start Brandi with something you highlighted today, which I think people [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=904.6199999999999s)]
*  that don't spend as much time in these quarters of the internet as I do and certainly as you [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=907.42s)]
*  do, this is your full time job, unfortunately, for you. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=911.78s)]
*  So today there's this horrible school shooting in Iowa in a school called Perry High School. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=915.8199999999999s)]
*  And you've got a right wing conspiracy theorist posting this. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=921.52s)]
*  Not even 24 hours after the Epstein court documents was released, we have multiple victims [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=926.5s)]
*  who were shot at Perry High School in Perry, Iowa. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=931.22s)]
*  Make no mistake, this is a false flag to distract the media from discussing anything in relation [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=933.66s)]
*  to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=938.62s)]
*  As more names will be released in the coming days, we expect more serious distractions [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  and false flags. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=944.02s)]
*  All assets have been deployed. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=945.22s)]
*  This is totally false, right? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=946.26s)]
*  But it gives you an indication of how large Epstein as the secret to the global cabal [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=948.86s)]
*  looms in this world. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=954.8199999999999s)]
*  You said it is the skeleton key. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=956.96s)]
*  Like I will talk to conspiracy theorists sometimes, sometimes formers, and they will talk about [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=958.46s)]
*  Epstein is a sort of gateway drug into these conspiracy theories because, you know, if [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=962.66s)]
*  you say that a cabal of, you know, rich, powerful men who abuse young girls isn't real, look [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=966.86s)]
*  at Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=973.1800000000001s)]
*  And then how can you really fight back against that? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=974.02s)]
*  Because I am I can only operate from facts and evidence and their own imagination is [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=975.9s)]
*  the only thing that hinders them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=981.78s)]
*  And so it's just very, very difficult. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=983.14s)]
*  And I'm trying to stay calmer than I want to be because it's so frustrating. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=985.62s)]
*  No one is keeping this information from you. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=990.1s)]
*  All of the journalists that, you know, we've been working on this for a decade, the Jeffrey [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=992.38s)]
*  Epstein stuff. This black book has been in the public because Gawker published it in [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=996.98s)]
*  2015, I think it's all there. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1001.62s)]
*  So you're waiting on the edge of your seat until something happens. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1004.54s)]
*  Maybe something will happen with these new documents. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1008.46s)]
*  But that's that's part of what's so maddening here, too, is that, you know, Julie Brown, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1010.26s)]
*  who's the reporter who broke much, much rebroke the story in many ways because all these victims [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1014.22s)]
*  didn't know about the sweetheart deal and they came forward to her and she does incredible [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1018.94s)]
*  work. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1022.14s)]
*  A mainstream press organization like it's not like secret knowledge they don't want [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1023.14s)]
*  you to know about. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1027.02s)]
*  And yet somehow, again, they have completely levered this into this like everyone you hate, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1028.02s)]
*  the media, the institutions, the Democrats, the Clintons, whatever, like this shows they're [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1040.62s)]
*  all wrong. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1044.62s)]
*  But isn't that just a microcosm of how right wing populism works? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1045.62s)]
*  It takes people's kind of justified anger and frustration and horror at the failures [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1048.86s)]
*  various elites and then directs it, misdirects it in a way that ends up absolving the people [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1055.54s)]
*  who've caused these disasters in the first place. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1062.26s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of how it works. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1064.62s)]
*  You know, it's how it works with COVID. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1066.54s)]
*  It's how it works with the economy. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1067.86s)]
*  And I think it's you know, you can see it really acutely here. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1069.78s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1072.82s)]
*  It's just like in this particular case, it's you're totally right. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1073.82s)]
*  It is the M.O. for how kind of right wing populism works. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1076.7s)]
*  But in this case, it's like literally the guy that gave him the sweetheart plea was [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1079.42s)]
*  a Trump Trump appointed him and defended him. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1084.38s)]
*  It's like that's Donald Trump's dude. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1087.1000000000001s)]
*  But the projection is such an important part of this. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, and the projection is such an important part, obviously, of Donald Trump's M.O., but [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1092.26s)]
*  it's an important part of at this point, the entire right wing ecosystem, you know, which [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1095.8600000000001s)]
*  has to defend or not has to has chosen to defend a serial sexual abuser who is also [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1100.76s)]
*  taken all this money from foreign countries, as you noted in your intro, and is basically [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1108.72s)]
*  guilty of every single crime that they imagine their enemies to be guilty of. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1113.1200000000001s)]
*  The only way to kind of see themselves as the forces of light is to engage in just a [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1118.48s)]
*  constant in constant projection. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1124.72s)]
*  There's another aspect to the sort of totemic role Epstein plays in this world, which is [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1128.3200000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitism, right? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1132.8000000000002s)]
*  Because it's like he becomes this. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  It's like it's not just a cabal, but it's he's Jewish and it's a Jewish cabal. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1136.08s)]
*  And I saw this. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1139.6799999999998s)]
*  You see this everywhere today. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1140.6799999999998s)]
*  But it's like it's never that train is never late. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1141.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1144.1599999999999s)]
*  From like conspiracy theories to the Jewish cabal. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's especially because of the war right now. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1147.0s)]
*  So now you have a whole nother interested party of people sort of looking to demonize [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1149.6s)]
*  Israel and anyone associated with it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1154.08s)]
*  But I really think it's important to understand that this is such a choose your own adventure [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  of conspiracy theorism, because really, it doesn't matter. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1160.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes, all that stuff about Trump and Acosta. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1164.4s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1168.44s)]
*  But you have the other stuff. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1169.84s)]
*  You have Clinton on the plane and Bill Gates and Les Wexner. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1171.48s)]
*  So you have businessmen, you have model agents, you have literally every the black book had [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1175.08s)]
*  like 2000 people in it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1181.64s)]
*  You can pick whoever you want your enemy to be in that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1183.4s)]
*  That's why it's so perfect. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1186.4s)]
*  He says he was the scandal. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1187.4s)]
*  I think that we know and that is definitely established is that people knew what this [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1189.16s)]
*  guy did and what he was up to and didn't have qualms about taking his money, about [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1193.04s)]
*  hanging out with him. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1196.56s)]
*  That we can definitely establish who may have also engaged in the kind of behavior he does. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1197.56s)]
*  We can't definitively establish. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1202.08s)]
*  But that first order scandal is enormous and disgusting. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1203.84s)]
*  And it also involves hundreds of people because his picture is within everyone. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's why it makes it so so perfectly fertile. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1210.56s)]
*  Brandy Zydrosny, Michelle Goldberg. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1213.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1215.68s)]
*  Coming up, Congressman Jamie Raskin on his new report on the millions of dollars Donald [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1217.1599999999999s)]
*  Trump took in from China while president. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1221.12s)]
*  But first, new reporting on the pressure tactics Trump uses to keep his vice-like grip on the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1225.2399999999998s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1229.6799999999998s)]
*  You've probably heard the phrase bend the knee. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1235.56s)]
*  Long predates HBO's Game of Thrones, but it was often used on that show when a monarchical [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1237.8799999999999s)]
*  figure managed to impose their will on a subjugated populace, reinforcing that this new person [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1242.4799999999998s)]
*  was fully in charge. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1248.8400000000001s)]
*  I offer you a choice. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1251.0800000000002s)]
*  Bend the knee and join me. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1253.76s)]
*  Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1255.72s)]
*  Or refuse. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1260.3200000000002s)]
*  And die. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1262.92s)]
*  That brutal pre-democratic vision of governance through force is, I think, one of the few [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1278.64s)]
*  sincere beliefs that's held by the ex-president. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1291.76s)]
*  Donald Trump underscores it all the time when he congratulates Kim Jong-un or Xi Jinping [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1294.88s)]
*  or Vladimir Putin. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1299.1200000000001s)]
*  He has conducted himself in that fashion nowhere more so than within the Republican Party, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1301.16s)]
*  where he views himself as a king to whom everyone must pledge loyalty. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1305.32s)]
*  And amazingly, it has worked as documented in new reporting from the New York Times. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1308.84s)]
*  In October, Trump sunk a top candidate for speaker Tom Emmer by posting that voting [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1313.3999999999999s)]
*  for him would be a tragic mistake. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  On Wednesday, Emmer capitulated and endorsed him. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1320.28s)]
*  They always bend the knee, Trump said privately of Emmer's endorsement. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1323.0s)]
*  Timothy Snyder is a professor of history at Yale University and expert on the history [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1327.32s)]
*  of fascism, author of On Tyranny, 20 Lessons from the 20th Century. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1331.24s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1335.48s)]
*  I guess one of the things that I've been thinking about with this story is there's some line [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1338.0s)]
*  of normal, rough-and-tumble democratic politics, which is cajoling people to get endorsements [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1342.08s)]
*  and maybe even threatening them. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1348.44s)]
*  I'm going to come after you in the press if you don't. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1350.04s)]
*  And then there's the vision of loyalty in a sort of autocratic way. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1353.8s)]
*  And what makes him on the other side of that line in your mind? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1360.16s)]
*  I think because, first of all, it's all personal. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1365.68s)]
*  There's never any loyalty to the law or to institutions or to the Constitution or to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1369.16s)]
*  the government or to the country. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1373.96s)]
*  It's all personal. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1376.48s)]
*  And that's where the line is. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1378.0400000000002s)]
*  Sure, a normal democratic politician will trade favors, will want this for that. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1379.88s)]
*  But there's usually some sense of operating within the rules. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1384.7s)]
*  For Mr. Trump, there aren't rules. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1388.36s)]
*  There's just the idea of him as a person. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1390.7199999999998s)]
*  There's also the aspect, and I don't think this is the case in like Tom Emmer's case, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1394.4399999999998s)]
*  that he was worried about physical violence or threats. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1398.4799999999998s)]
*  But it is the case, clearly. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1401.24s)]
*  And you see it in the discourse, and you've commented on this a little bit, even about [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1402.52s)]
*  how people react to the Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ruling, that if you go along with [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1406.6799999999998s)]
*  this, there will be violence. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1412.0s)]
*  And we know firsthand from a number of different accounts, including McKay Coppin's biography [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1413.82s)]
*  of Mitt Romney and other former members of Congress, that people have made calculations [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1418.2s)]
*  about how they will politically relate to Donald Trump based purely on fear and fear [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1423.44s)]
*  of threats for them and their family. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1430.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1432.24s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1433.24s)]
*  There's no dragon, right? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1435.68s)]
*  I mean, he's not physically fearful. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1436.68s)]
*  The only source of fear is what he's going to say about you on social media and then [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1440.32s)]
*  how other people might react to that. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1443.76s)]
*  So there's a pretty profound cowardice inside his own threats. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1446.36s)]
*  He's not actually facing anybody directly. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1450.8799999999999s)]
*  What you say about the Supreme Court is really important. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1453.12s)]
*  I mean, if we exist at all, we exist as a nation under law. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1456.12s)]
*  And the Supreme Court has the Constitution, in which the very clear wording of Section [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1460.6s)]
*  3 of the 14th Amendment makes it clear that an insurrectionist like Mr. Trump or like [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1466.4399999999998s)]
*  a number of other people can't hold the presidency or, for that matter, any other state or federal [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1470.12s)]
*  office. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1474.9599999999998s)]
*  And yet we find a lot of people saying, well, you know, we're kind of afraid of what his [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1476.2s)]
*  supporters might do if we enforce the law of the land. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1479.52s)]
*  And if once you take that step, once you preemptively concede that you don't really believe in the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1483.92s)]
*  law because you're afraid of a threat that hasn't even been made, then you're taking [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1488.76s)]
*  part in undoing the republic. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1493.76s)]
*  There was another story today that struck me about this sort of, you know, cult of personality [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1496.32s)]
*  or sort of this sort of, you know, king-like view of loyalty, right? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1501.48s)]
*  Which to me is just fundamentally deeply anti-democratic in its ethos. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1505.76s)]
*  Elise Stefanik withdrew her endorsement of a Republican candidate in Ohio who mildly [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1510.1200000000001s)]
*  criticized Trump. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1517.24s)]
*  This is what Craig Rydell said. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1518.52s)]
*  He said, I think he's arrogant. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1520.28s)]
*  I don't like the way he calls people names. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1521.28s)]
*  I just don't think that's very becoming of a president, he said in an audio recording. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1522.96s)]
*  Stefanik said this. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1526.96s)]
*  Earlier this week, I informed Craig Rydell that I will be withdrawing my endorsement. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1529.0s)]
*  I was very disappointed in his inappropriate comments regarding President Trump. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1532.84s)]
*  As we begin 2024, my focus is on ensuring we nominate the strongest candidates in the [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1536.6399999999999s)]
*  ballot who are committed to electing President Trump this November and expanding our House [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1540.32s)]
*  GOP majority. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1544.2s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1545.6s)]
*  I think it's striking that anyone would think that appropriate and inappropriate are the [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1547.72s)]
*  criteria that one would apply to Donald Trump, right? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1552.72s)]
*  I mean, the way she's using the word inappropriate is we must simply follow along with whatever [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1556.72s)]
*  the man says and we must simply anticipate his every need and do what that is. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1562.8000000000002s)]
*  That's a standard of appropriateness and inappropriateness, which has nothing to do with [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1569.0400000000002s)]
*  policy or with the law or what's good for the country. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1572.6000000000001s)]
*  It just has to do with the whims of someone who you regard as a leader. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1575.8400000000001s)]
*  And for me, that's the distinction going back to your earlier question. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1579.4s)]
*  He's not meant to be a candidate or a president or an executive officer. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1582.4s)]
*  From this point of view, he's a leader with a capital L. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1586.92s)]
*  He's just a person. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1590.3600000000001s)]
*  He's not somebody who holds an office. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1591.3999999999999s)]
*  Committee Snider, as always. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1593.76s)]
*  Thank you, sir. So glad. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1595.12s)]
*  Still to come, a damning new report on just how much foreign money Donald Trump made while [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1598.08s)]
*  he was president. Congressman Jimmy Raskin on the costly lessons from Trump's time in [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1601.8799999999999s)]
*  the White House. Ahead. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1605.8s)]
*  Today, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a new report documenting more [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1612.9599999999998s)]
*  than seven point eight million dollars that Donald Trump received as president from [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1617.1599999999999s)]
*  foreign states and their leaders, including some of the world's most unsavory regimes. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1621.9199999999998s)]
*  The money came from at least 20 countries, with China making the largest total payment [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1626.7199999999998s)]
*  to President Trump's private business interests. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1631.2399999999998s)]
*  This finding is particularly cutting and almost comical considering the wild goose chase [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1634.36s)]
*  the Republican members of that same committee have been leading against President Joe [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1639.12s)]
*  Biden. They are trying to impeach the current president over his adult [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1642.3999999999999s)]
*  son's business relationship with the Chinese company while Joe Biden was out of office. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1645.88s)]
*  They are claiming without any evidence that some of those payments went to Biden, senior. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1651.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats just revealed one hundred and fifty six pages of evidence about the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1656.16s)]
*  millions of dollars that Donald Trump received from foreign governments, including China, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1660.68s)]
*  while he was occupying the Oval Office. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1665.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, if it sounds to you like that should not be allowed, you're correct. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1668.5200000000002s)]
*  It does appear to be blatantly unconstitutional. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1672.5200000000002s)]
*  It is blatantly unconstitutional under the Foreign Emoluments Clause in Article One, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1674.72s)]
*  Section Nine, and I quote, No person holding any office shall without the consent of the [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1679.4s)]
*  Congress accept any president emolument office or title of any kind, whatever, from any [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1683.48s)]
*  king, prince or foreign state. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1688.8s)]
*  The founders made that provision to prevent our leaders from being corrupted, particularly [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1691.2s)]
*  by foreign agents. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1694.6000000000001s)]
*  While Donald Trump was still in office, it was obvious to everyone. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1695.92s)]
*  We covered it dozens, if not hundreds of times, that his business interests, including the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1700.0s)]
*  International Hotel, left him wide open to foreign influence in violation of the Emoluments [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1704.28s)]
*  Clause. In fact, multiple groups brought suit against him. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1710.48s)]
*  But our courts just could not bring themselves to rule on this unprecedented situation. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1715.12s)]
*  The Supreme Court declined to review one case and declared others moot after Trump left [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1720.6s)]
*  office. And the lesson Americans learned is that the Emoluments Clause essentially just [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1725.0s)]
*  no longer exists. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1730.6s)]
*  If someone can violate it as clearly as Donald Trump did and face no repercussion, they can't [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1732.12s)]
*  find anyone withstanding. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1736.32s)]
*  The people do have standing get hung up in court until he leaves. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1737.48s)]
*  Well, it might as well just no longer be in the Constitution. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1740.56s)]
*  Now, it seems like we might be at a similar point with another key portion of the [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1744.4s)]
*  Constitution, Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1748.24s)]
*  That's the clause that prohibits any officer of the United States who engaged in insurrection [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1751.4s)]
*  from ever holding office again. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1755.52s)]
*  Last month, the Colorado Supreme Court and Maine's Secretary of State ruled that Donald [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1757.44s)]
*  Trump is in violation of that section of the Constitution and subsequently cannot appear [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1761.76s)]
*  on the ballot in those states. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1767.4s)]
*  The big question is whether the Supreme Court will uphold those decisions or if Section [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1769.56s)]
*  Three is just going to go the way of the Emoluments Clause. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1773.1200000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk about all that with one of the authors of the report on Donald Trump's [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1776.2s)]
*  foreign payments, ranking member of the Oversight Committee, Jamie Raskin. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1779.76s)]
*  Next. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1783.2s)]
*  We now have concrete evidence that Donald Trump received millions of dollars from foreign [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1787.24s)]
*  governments while he was president of the United States. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1790.88s)]
*  Comes from a new 156 page report by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee titled [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1793.48s)]
*  White House For Sale, How Princes, Prime Ministers and Premiers Paid Off President [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1798.56s)]
*  Trump. As ranking member Jamie Raskin explains in the reports forward, quote, By [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1802.24s)]
*  elevating his personal financial interests and the policy priorities of corrupt foreign [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1806.44s)]
*  powers over the American public interests, former President Trump violated both the clear [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1810.48s)]
*  commands of the Constitution and the careful precedent set and observed by every previous [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1814.92s)]
*  commander in chief. Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland is the top Democrat on the Oversight [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1819.5600000000002s)]
*  Committee that produced the report and he joins me now. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1824.0s)]
*  Congressman, I want to start with the sort of top lines of the report. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1826.92s)]
*  I want to be clear here about what you did and did not find. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1829.88s)]
*  My read of the report is that there's no smoking gun of like, you know, a briefcase [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1833.3200000000002s)]
*  of cash from a Chinese agent given to the president. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1839.24s)]
*  These are all done through the existing business interests of the president who refused [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1843.68s)]
*  to divest from them in any way during his time. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1849.44s)]
*  This is all above the table cash, Chris. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1852.92s)]
*  We didn't do under the table, which isn't to say that it didn't exist. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1856.48s)]
*  And we also didn't look at payments that came in from foreign governments to Donald [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1860.2s)]
*  Trump and other federal officials like Jared Kushner. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1865.8400000000001s)]
*  After the administration ended, Kushner, of course, had a fine payout of two billion [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1868.8s)]
*  dollars that he got from Saudi Arabia. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1874.48s)]
*  But we didn't get into that. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1876.64s)]
*  This was all money that was received at Trump's owned enterprises, four of the more than [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1877.92s)]
*  five hundred, because we were only able to get information on four of them. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1884.84s)]
*  The Trump World Tower in Fifth Avenue in New York, the Trump International Tower at [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1888.92s)]
*  U.N. Plaza, the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas and the Trump International Hotel [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1896.44s)]
*  in Washington, which they've sold off, which I used to call the Washington emoluments, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1902.92s)]
*  because that was the magnet for all the diplomats in federal and foreign governments to come [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1907.24s)]
*  drop off their money. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1913.24s)]
*  Do you think what you found, and these are millions of dollars going from state, from [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1914.8400000000001s)]
*  governments to the pockets of the president via his businesses, right, just all out in [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1919.68s)]
*  the open again, only four of them that you were able to track. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1923.52s)]
*  Do you think that is a violation of the emoluments clause? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1926.28s)]
*  No question. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1930.68s)]
*  The emoluments clause is stated in absolute and categorical terms that the president, no [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1932.68s)]
*  federal official, can take any money of any kind whatsoever, an emolument or an office, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1938.2s)]
*  a president, a title from a prince king or foreign government without the explicit consent [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1945.48s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1952.48s)]
*  And every other president in our history has scrupulously obeyed that command. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1953.2s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln in 1862 in the middle of the Civil War was given two elephant tusks by [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1957.88s)]
*  the King of Siam. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1964.16s)]
*  He turned them over to Congress. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1965.4s)]
*  He really liked them. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1966.96s)]
*  I think it appears he wanted to keep them. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1967.76s)]
*  But they said, no, you can't keep them. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1969.76s)]
*  Turn them over to the Department of Interior. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1971.36s)]
*  And he did. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1973.1200000000001s)]
*  And every other president has basically acted in that way. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1974.04s)]
*  You know, Barack Obama was told that the $1.4 million payment for the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1977.9199999999998s)]
*  was something that offended the spirit of the emoluments clause, and he promptly gave [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1984.6s)]
*  it away. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1990.76s)]
*  Only Donald Trump has pocketed this astonishing sum of $7.8 million. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1991.1999999999998s)]
*  And as we explained in the report, that probably just scratches the surface. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1996.24s)]
*  But you'll see that we used a very conservative accounting methods here, and the Republicans [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=1999.84s)]
*  have not been able to find one thing wrong with this report. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2004.8799999999999s)]
*  They've basically accepted the facts. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2007.52s)]
*  Yeah, I should. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2009.52s)]
*  That was what struck me, actually, when I went into it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2010.48s)]
*  Because when I first saw the number, I was like, well, that's lower than I would have [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2012.8s)]
*  guessed with Donald Trump. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2015.2s)]
*  But actually, it's just four properties that you could account for out of, you know, 500 [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2016.72s)]
*  possible holdings and everything that you could definitively establish. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2020.24s)]
*  And it was just for two years of the four years he was in office. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2025.76s)]
*  And it was just for 20 countries of 195 countries on Earth. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2029.36s)]
*  And we know there were lots of other countries involved. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2034.0s)]
*  And we get into the report, everything that we didn't know. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2036.48s)]
*  But we wanted to scrupulously document and anchor everything in receipts that we have [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2038.96s)]
*  from the main offenders in this report, China, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2045.04s)]
*  and so on. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2051.68s)]
*  But we've got the receipts here. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2052.32s)]
*  And so I say to Chairman Comer, who's been talking about President Biden for a year, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2054.8s)]
*  where are your receipts? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2060.96s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2062.7999999999997s)]
*  When are you going to publish what you purport to show Joe Biden has taken as foreign [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2063.3599999999997s)]
*  government emoluments since he's been in office? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2069.68s)]
*  I want to get your read on what I said in the previous block. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2072.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if you saw it, but just about how it seems to me there's a little [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2076.56s)]
*  parallel between what happened to the emoluments clause during Trump and what's happening now [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2079.52s)]
*  with the 14th Amendment Section 3, which is basically that like no one could kind of bring [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2083.2s)]
*  themselves in the courts, could bring themselves to bite the bullet on what was plainly the [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2088.4s)]
*  case constitutionally. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  And ergo, it just sort of like ran out of steam. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2096.48s)]
*  They basically foot dragged and then it got mooted. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2099.12s)]
*  And it seems like there's sort of an interesting decision point for the courts here, too, on [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2101.84s)]
*  the 14th Amendment. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2105.84s)]
*  Well, the self-proclaimed originalists and textualists are just Trumpists because it's [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2107.36s)]
*  very clear in both cases you cite the Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which says if you've [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2113.36s)]
*  engaged in insurrection or rebellion as an officeholder, you can't hold office again. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2120.0s)]
*  And here with the emoluments clause, you just can't take any money from foreign governments [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2124.2400000000002s)]
*  and kings and princes without going to Congress first. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2129.04s)]
*  It's very clear in the language itself. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2131.6s)]
*  And when you go back to the original purposes, it's extremely clear that there was a wall [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2133.84s)]
*  of separation that the framers wanted to create between the personal finances of the president [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2139.44s)]
*  and the states, the government's finances. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2144.4s)]
*  And they wanted to make sure the president would be a loyal fiduciary, an agent of the [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2147.36s)]
*  American people, not Chinese government, communist bureaucrats or corrupt Saudi monarchs. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2151.76s)]
*  But that's the situation that we're in. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2157.6s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2159.36s)]
*  This is the true test for the originalists and textualists on the court. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2161.04s)]
*  Do they actually believe in enforcing the constitution we have? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2164.64s)]
*  Or have they too been completely swept up by the autocratic collapse of the Republican Party? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2168.24s)]
*  Donald Trump controls it like a religious cult. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2175.8399999999997s)]
*  I suspect I have an answer for you, but we'll see Congressman Jamie Raskin. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2178.08s)]
*  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2182.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2184.3199999999997s)]
*  Still ahead, it's been nearly three years since Donald Trump instigated an attack on [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2185.3599999999997s)]
*  Congress to try to steal the presidency. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2188.9599999999996s)]
*  So why isn't that the universally accepted truth? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2191.3599999999997s)]
*  Next. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2194.7999999999997s)]
*  Tomorrow, on the eve of the third anniversary of the worst attack on American democracy [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2198.9599999999996s)]
*  since at least the Civil War, President Joe Biden is going to give a speech near Valley [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2204.24s)]
*  Forge, Pennsylvania, historic site in the Revolutionary War, to talk about the stakes [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2209.4399999999996s)]
*  for democracy in this critical election year. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2213.68s)]
*  In the run up to the anniversary of January 6th, the Associated Press ran this article, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2216.72s)]
*  which contains some pretty interesting facts. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2220.56s)]
*  But the headline almost seems designed as a parody of the most caricatured sort of [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2223.2s)]
*  both sides journalism. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2226.96s)]
*  It reads like this. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2228.64s)]
*  One attack, two interpretations. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2229.76s)]
*  Biden and Trump both make the January 6th riot a political rallying cry. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2232.08s)]
*  I mean, at some level, it's true that both campaigns have made it a rallying cry. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2236.88s)]
*  But for candidate Joe Biden, January 6th was terrible. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2241.2s)]
*  American democracy is good. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2244.48s)]
*  And January 6th should never happen again. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2246.32s)]
*  For candidate Donald Trump, January 6th was good. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2248.88s)]
*  It was only bad it didn't work. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2251.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump should be president forever. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2253.36s)]
*  And Kate Coppins is a staff writer for The Atlantic and author of the new Mitt Romney [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2256.32s)]
*  biography, and he joins me now. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2259.68s)]
*  Here's the thing that I find the most upsetting about this is that I really do think it's [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2262.64s)]
*  the case that in January 7th in America, January 8th and 9th, basically broadly across all [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2268.72s)]
*  sorts of lines of difference in American life, race class, gender and partisan affiliation, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2277.12s)]
*  ideological disposition, there was broadly a consensus that that was really bad what [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2283.84s)]
*  happened. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2288.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2289.6000000000004s)]
*  And now it's fallen apart. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2290.0s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2291.6000000000004s)]
*  So I remember in the days after January 6th, you started to see some of these narratives [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2293.92s)]
*  bubble up in elements of the conservative media, that this was a false flag attack or [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2300.8s)]
*  that Antifa was involved or something. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2305.92s)]
*  And I remember these were really at the fringes of conservative media on social media. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  And I remember thinking, that stuff is really bad, but that's going to stay on the fringes, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2312.64s)]
*  because at that time, what you saw was a wide scale denunciation of what was happening, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2317.68s)]
*  what had happened by many Republican leaders. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2324.7999999999997s)]
*  And you also saw kind of a rush to the exits of Trump land from Republican leaders, like [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2327.52s)]
*  Lindsey Graham and Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell had condemned it. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2331.7599999999998s)]
*  And I remember thinking, if only for their own political self-interest, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2336.56s)]
*  most of the Republican establishment is going to take this as an opportunity to move on from Trump. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2342.8799999999997s)]
*  I think what happened, to answer your question, is that Trump dropped in the polls for a little [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2348.24s)]
*  while, his approval ratings sank. And then he just kind of stayed around, and Republican voters came [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2353.12s)]
*  back around to him. And then Republican leaders had to come back around to him to stay in office. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2358.24s)]
*  And what happened was to satisfy their own kind of cognitive dissonance, right? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2364.08s)]
*  They had to invent these new conspiracy theories or narratives to convince themselves that it was [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2368.72s)]
*  OK to continue to support Trump after what he had done and what he had incited on January 6. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2376.16s)]
*  Yeah. And one of the big ones is sort of false flag. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2381.2s)]
*  Akin, I would say not that different in structure from 9-11 was an inside job, basically, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2385.68s)]
*  which is a false and wrong and insidious conspiracy theory that used to have a lot [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2393.3599999999997s)]
*  of traction in American life. The idea of this was, here's the recent poll. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2397.84s)]
*  Do you think it is true or false that FBI operatives organized and encouraged a capital attack? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  A quarter of people say definitely and probably true. Only half say definitely and probably false. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2409.2000000000003s)]
*  That's not of Republicans. That's of all people. And then you've got people like Senator Mike Lee, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2413.6800000000003s)]
*  the home state senator with Mitt Romney, basically hawking this ludicrous conspiracy theory [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2419.28s)]
*  on Twitter, like trolling Liz Cheney with how many of these guys are feds, as if you'd ever [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2425.6s)]
*  tell us, like posting viral videos that are completely wrong, which says a guy showing a [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2431.2s)]
*  bad, which is not like that is mainstream as it gets. Yeah. I mean, I have to say that those [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2436.0s)]
*  tweets from Mike Lee are really alarming and I think should be getting more attention. I'm glad [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2442.16s)]
*  we're talking about them. I mean, this is a sitting U.S. senator spreading falsifiable propaganda that [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2446.08s)]
*  he appears to have no intention of retracting or apologizing for. And it's all in service of this [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2453.52s)]
*  idea that what happened on January 6th was actually somehow a crime against Republicans or a crime [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2460.16s)]
*  against Donald Trump. And again, I think this is where you see the kind of cognitive dissonance at [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2465.68s)]
*  work. Like Mike Lee knew most likely, I would have to assume, what was happening on January 6th was [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2470.48s)]
*  bad. He knew that this was a travesty, but he is a close ally of Trump's. He has to continue to [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2476.4s)]
*  support Donald Trump. And so he has invented or kind of bought into this idea. Now, I don't know [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2483.6s)]
*  how sincere it is or not, but I can tell you, having written about Mitt Romney, Romney was in [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2489.52s)]
*  the weeks, months after January 6th, still in a headspace of how can we make sure we never forget [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtNbfXCIXPA&t=2494.96s)]
