# Pence hits Trump during campaign launch: He ‘should never’ be president again
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk)
*  I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be President of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=0.0s)]
*  And anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be President of the United States again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=6.0s)]
*  The grift from this family is breathtaking. It's breathtaking. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=16.0s)]
*  Jared Kushner and Ivanka Kushner walk out of the White House [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=22.0s)]
*  and months later get $2 billion from the Saudis. $2 billion from the Saudis. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=26.0s)]
*  You think it's because he's some kind of investing genius? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=34.0s)]
*  Or do you think it's because he was sitting next to the President of the United States for four years doing favors for the Saudis? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=37.0s)]
*  That's your money. That's your money he stole. And gave it to his family. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=43.0s)]
*  You know what that makes us? A Banana Republic. That's what it makes us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=49.0s)]
*  So in just the last 24 hours, three new candidates have joined officially the Republican primary. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=54.0s)]
*  Last night it was former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=59.0s)]
*  Today it was former Vice President Mike Pence as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=62.0s)]
*  In all, there are now 10 candidates running for the nomination. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=67.0s)]
*  And that tracks the 2016 race when exactly 10 candidates had announced by this point. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=71.0s)]
*  Not including Donald Trump who did not announce until mid-June. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=76.0s)]
*  Of course, that field eventually blew up to 17 candidates by the fall. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=80.0s)]
*  George Pataki. I actually forgot that until I looked at that graphic. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=84.0s)]
*  There are a lot of differences between that race and this one. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=88.0s)]
*  For one thing, I think there's an increasing belief that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis might be a bit overhyped, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=90.0s)]
*  but he is pulling in 25, 30 percent in polls. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=96.0s)]
*  And of course, there's an enormous obvious frontrunner, right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=100.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, who's leading the field, and between the two of them, they're drawing 70 percent of voters. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=103.0s)]
*  But on top of that, there's the potential for Donald Trump to face yet another indictment, possibly more. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=109.0s)]
*  Sarah Longwell is a publisher of The Bulwark, host of the Focus Group podcast, and she joins me now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=115.0s)]
*  First, I want to start with this point about the logic of entering the race. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=120.0s)]
*  You've got polling. Here's the latest Republican primary poll. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=124.0s)]
*  So you've got Trump at 56 and DeSantis at 22. It's still very early. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=127.0s)]
*  But that's super different than 2015, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=131.0s)]
*  There's 78 percent of voters clustered around these two candidates. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=134.0s)]
*  My thinking is that the general thinking of everyone else is DeSantis really ain't all that, and Lord knows what's going to happen to Donald Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=139.0s)]
*  Is that how you see it? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=148.0s)]
*  I guess. I mean, I think it's different for different people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=150.0s)]
*  I think there are some of them that are running for maybe vice president more than they are president. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=155.0s)]
*  I think there are people who are in it for the name ID. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=161.0s)]
*  I did not know who the governor of North Dakota was, and now I do. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=164.0s)]
*  So he's already doing something there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=169.0s)]
*  You've got Vivek Ramaswamy, somebody I had never heard of. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=172.0s)]
*  And, you know, Chris Christie, I think, is getting in really to try to go hard at Trump because he thinks that there's a market to do that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=176.0s)]
*  So I think there's a variety of reasons for people getting in. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=183.0s)]
*  I think for Mike Pence, he thinks God really wants him to be president. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=186.0s)]
*  I think he always thought he would be president. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=191.0s)]
*  He also really wants to be president. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=193.0s)]
*  He really wants to be president. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=195.0s)]
*  He and God agree on that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=196.0s)]
*  That's right. Unfortunately, you know, who doesn't agree is the voters. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=198.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not sure there is anybody that we talk to in the focus groups who are more savage, who they are more savage to than Mike Pence. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=201.0s)]
*  I want to talk about that because Ben, my former colleague Benji Sarlin is now at Semaphore, made a point today, which I thought was interesting. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=210.0s)]
*  He said, look, on paper, just on paper, if you say I like I love Trump, I'm a conservative Republican, I like Trump, everything but the January 6th stuff. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=216.0s)]
*  That was too much. And maybe like the tweeting on paper. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=225.0s)]
*  That's the Pence pitch, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=229.0s)]
*  Like Trump, minus the country's first coup is basically the Pence pitch. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=230.0s)]
*  And yet that doesn't like that's on paper. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=237.0s)]
*  But in reality, that doesn't seem to be selling. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, here's the problem for Mike Pence. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=242.0s)]
*  He is in the sour spot with voters. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=244.0s)]
*  Either the people who really love Trump think that he is a traitor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=246.0s)]
*  They, you know, wish him ill. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=250.0s)]
*  And then there's the crowd that just thinks he's boring or thinks he's a nice guy but sort of doesn't have a political future. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=254.0s)]
*  The thing that's happened in our politics is people really crave now a certain combative style that Mike Pence, to his credit, does not have. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=262.0s)]
*  And I think it's a evidence of the dysfunction of the Republican Party that there is no chance that Mike Pence could win a Republican primary. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was just saying people, Republican primary voters, I think, just to specify. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=280.0s)]
*  I know you meant that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=284.0s)]
*  But I because I do think I think the general voter is actually way less into the combative schtick. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=285.0s)]
*  And honestly, I think there's a case to be made that like a sort of noncompatitive and more boring candidate might actually perform better in a general election. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=291.0s)]
*  I don't know. But I think there's certainly a case for that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=300.0s)]
*  But the desire, the thirst for blood combat on the primary folks in your focus group people is pretty clear, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=302.0s)]
*  It's super clear. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=309.0s)]
*  And look, you take a guy like Tim Scott, I think Tim Scott would be a phenomenal general election candidate. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=311.0s)]
*  I think that he would do really well with swing voters. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=316.0s)]
*  I think the chances of his sort of optimistic pitch getting out of a Republican primary is really slim. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=319.0s)]
*  Sunny optimism is not where the voters have been. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=326.0s)]
*  And a lot of that is because Trump again has sort of trained people to feel sort of in a constant state of grievance, a constant state of anger. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=331.0s)]
*  And so, you know, really what people are looking for when they say they want somebody besides Trump is they say Trump without the baggage. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=339.0s)]
*  That is the phrase I always hear. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=346.0s)]
*  And that has been sort of the DeSantis pitch. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=348.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, there's a reason why the vast majority of the party wants one of those two people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=351.0s)]
*  And I'll just add one thing, you know, for a lot of these candidates who ran in the pre-Trump era, ran in the last back in 2016, the voters have a real sense of sort of the before times candidates, the people who were there before Trump. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=356.0s)]
*  And they think of them as establishment. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=369.0s)]
*  They have no interest in them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=371.0s)]
*  I can't tell you what it means to be kind of a before times establishment candidate. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=373.0s)]
*  That is just not what Republican primary voters want. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=376.0s)]
*  I wish I could tell my 24 year old self how central America as a hellhole will be to the messaging and the American right in 2023. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=379.0s)]
*  Bizarre. Sarah Longwell, thank you very much. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=388.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=391.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVPC6bl1muk&t=409.0s)]
