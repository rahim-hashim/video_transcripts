# BREAKING: Supreme Court unanimously rules against Trump, orders return of mistakenly deported man
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We've got some big news at this hour. The Supreme Court has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=0.0s)]
*  Unanimously ruled against the Trump administration in a case regarding a Maryland man that the administration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=5.16s)]
*  Wrongfully arrested and deported to an El Salvador mega prison last month [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=11.24s)]
*  His name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia. We had his lawyer on the program just this week [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=16.88s)]
*  Just over a week ago [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=21.6s)]
*  The White House admitted in court that Garcia's deportation was a result of an administrative error [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=22.68s)]
*  Because you see back in 2019 Donald Trump was president during that time you might imagine [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=29.04s)]
*  He got protected immigration status, which meant he had an active order that he could not be removed or deported [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=33.88s)]
*  And yet he was rounded up by the Trump administration anyway [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=40.68s)]
*  And after they admitted to it in court, they refused to do anything about it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=44.42s)]
*  Basically, their stance was whoopsie. We made an oopsie. He's in an El Salvador supermax. You'll never hear from again [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=49.14s)]
*  What do you want from us? Well [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=55.56s)]
*  Just about two hours ago the Supreme Court weighed in unanimously [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  They now say that a district court which previously ruled in this case can indeed instruct the Trump administration to facilitate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  Garcia's return home [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=67.88s)]
*  It will not be immediate but the court says the White House has to start taking those steps [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=69.4s)]
*  Now because he's not in US custody. He's in the custody of foreign government El Salvador [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=73.92s)]
*  There's still a lot of open questions here, but [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=78.72s)]
*  Fundamentally the core issue in this and related litigation swirling around this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=82.12s)]
*  Maneuver the Trump administration has taken has been this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=90.48s)]
*  can a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=93.72s)]
*  President use the dubious invocation of a 200 year old law the alien enemies act which has only been used previously in wartime to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  Justify [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=103.28s)]
*  Basically snatching anyone off the streets and then quickly shipping them off to a foreign prison [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=105.28s)]
*  Where they will never be heard from again with zero due process [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=111.0s)]
*  None now to my mind and the minds of I think many legal observers the answer to that question has always been [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  Flatly no if the the Constitution protects against anything it protects against that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  But it has been a matter of whether or not this 6-3 conservative Supreme Court would acknowledge that reality [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=127.04s)]
*  Well, that's why tonight's such a big deal today's decision from the court is at the very least an indication that at a baseline [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=133.12s)]
*  They will and it is very very striking [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  There were no dissents here [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=141.8s)]
*  The administration did not even get Clarence Thomas or Samuel Alito or Neil Gorsuch on their side [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Writing in their defense [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  So to put it lightly that is not very common from this court [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=151.36s)]
*  When it comes to high stakes issue having to do with paying deference to Donald Trump [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=154.36s)]
*  Leah Littman is a professor at University of Michigan law school co-host of the strict scrutiny podcast along with Melissa Murray and my wife [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=158.96s)]
*  Kate Shaw she's also the author of a forthcoming book lawless, which is out next month and you can pre-order now [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Leah it's great to have you in the program. I guess just this stuff gets very complicated [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=170.68s)]
*  In terms procedurally, but what is your reading of this unanimous order from the court? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=175.64s)]
*  So it is good news [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=181.92s)]
*  It's better than what might have happened [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=183.64s)]
*  But I think it's far from perfect and it's far from over because what the Supreme Court did is they left in place the portion [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=185.55999999999997s)]
*  Of the district court order that required the government to facilitate [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=191.6s)]
*  Mr. Abrego Garcia's return [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  But they indicated that the district court needed to clarify what the court meant by directing the government to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  Effectuate ie actually bring about mr. Abrego Garcia's return and they suggested that the court might actually [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=204.04s)]
*  Lack the power to direct the government to effectuate the return so that creates this kind of liminal space [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=210.12s)]
*  What's the difference between facilitate and effectuate? What can the district board actually order the government to do? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  Can the government come back and say well we tried and El Salvador said no, sorry [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  We won't return him would that be sufficient and that's a sort of ambiguity that the Supreme Court's decision left open and that I'm very [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  concerned the administration is going to try to drive a truck through and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  You know take advantage of that ambiguity to delay if not prevent mr. Abrego Garcia's return [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we should say the district court judge here is judge Boasberg who has been the the subject of a lot of this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=244.56s)]
*  Judge is actually just zinnest [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=250.28s)]
*  This is not the Boasberg one the Boasberg one is another. Thank you very much is another line of cases having to do with the alien [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  enemies act [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=258.68s)]
*  This this judge here had said the district court judge had said basically [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=260.8s)]
*  You you have to go bring this guy back like this is not right you can't just say [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=264.32s)]
*  Nothing we can do. What do you want judge right? So the Supreme Court basically says [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=270.24s)]
*  Rejects the argument by the Department of Justice arguing for Trump that like there's nothing we can do [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=275.04s)]
*  They stop short of saying you must bring him back and they come down in the middle of like you got to try basically I [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=281.48s)]
*  Think that that's right, and I think that's why we can't give the Supreme Court too much credit right now [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=289.52s)]
*  We have to wait to see what they are actually going to do by way of enforcing the order and specifically are they going to allow? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=293.96s)]
*  the courts to hold the administration's feet to the fire and actually prove what the administration has tried to do and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=301.32s)]
*  Prove that doing other things might not be possible because the reality is that the administration negotiated in agreement with El Salvador [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=308.24s)]
*  So El Salvador is detaining individuals pursuant to an agreement with the United States [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=316.32s)]
*  And I think that makes it very likely that a single phone call from President Trump the United States [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  Could make El Salvador return. Mr. Abrego Garcia and the fact that they haven't done that already is appalling and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=325.2s)]
*  I'm very concerned that they are going to do what they have been doing in all of these other cases and try to obscure and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Obfuscate and go into court and say well we tried and you can't inquire about the court's decision [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  Any further beyond our statement that we have tried and done the right thing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=343.76s)]
*  And unless the Supreme Court is going to allow the lower court to actually probe the administration's representations [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=347.64s)]
*  And to get them to prove that they have made their best good faith efforts to return. Mr. Abrego Garcia [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=353.28s)]
*  I think everyone should still be focused on this case and trying to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=359.56s)]
*  Convince, you know the public the courts and the country that this administration needs to ensure Mr. Abrego Garcia [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=363.96s)]
*  Is returned to the United States. Yeah to your point there I mean in the other line of cases have to do with Judge Boasberg [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=369.8s)]
*  Who was the judge who ordered those planes to turn around and they didn't turn them around and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=375.8s)]
*  The president of El Salvador Bukele tweeted oops too late [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  And that was retweeted by Marco Rubio and the whole kind of idea was like nah, nah, nah, you can't touch us that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't think it's a mischaracterization to say that the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=390.76s)]
*  Posture of the Trump administration is not going to be able to do that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=394.12s)]
*  The posture of the Trump administration in court has been one of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=397.88s)]
*  truculence insolence [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=402.90000000000003s)]
*  like bordering on outright like [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=405.48s)]
*  Insubordination in front of the courts about what the court can make them do [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=408.26s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. I think in any other administration we could expect some good faith compliance [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=413.64s)]
*  With the directive to try to get Mr. Abrego Garcia's return [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=419.48s)]
*  And I think we could expect them to give honest straightforward answers about what they've tried to do and what is possible [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=422.76s)]
*  We can't expect that from this administration who walked into Judge Boasberg's court [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=427.72s)]
*  And when the judge asked them, did you what did you do? Did you turn the planes around? What directives were given? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  All they said is well we complied with your order and we are not authorized to say anything else [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=437.0s)]
*  And that kind of obfuscation could make it much harder for the courts to actually [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=441.4s)]
*  Ensure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return and that is what i'm concerned about [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and we should just note here there are enormous human stakes for Mr. Abrego Garcia as well as other plaintiffs who are suing here who are in a [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=449.64s)]
*  supermax [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=456.76s)]
*  prison under what I think [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=458.2s)]
*  Really can only be fairly described as appalling conditions [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=459.96s)]
*  With no means out [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  Like at all as far as we can tell [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=467.0s)]
*  um, you know men basically stacked like cordwood and uh, you know [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=469.64s)]
*  23 and a half hours a day [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  In captivity and not allowed to do anything [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  Um, so these are very very very urgent questions for the individuals that have been sent there leah litman. Thank you so much for [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  Making some time in the breaking news [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  You [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcq-lbWMxcw&t=507.72s)]
