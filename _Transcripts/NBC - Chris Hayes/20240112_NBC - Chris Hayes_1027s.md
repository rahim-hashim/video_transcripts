# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 11
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4)
*  Tonight, U.S. officials tell NBC News that American and British warships have launched [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=0.0s)]
*  strikes against multiple Houthi rebel targets inside Yemen after both navies fought off [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=4.68s)]
*  a barrage of more than 20 drones and missiles fired by the Iran-backed militant group earlier [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=10.06s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  These strikes come following increasing attacks by Houthis. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=16.6s)]
*  It started in mid-November in protest, Houthis say, of Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=19.44s)]
*  The group launched drone and missile strikes from Yemen on container ships transiting to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=24.64s)]
*  the Red Sea headed for the Suez Canal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=28.68s)]
*  The attacks have severely hindered container traffic through the Red Sea. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=31.92s)]
*  Eighty percent of container ships on the Suez Route diverted around the Cape of Good Hope, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=35.56s)]
*  South Africa, according to industry publications. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=40.24s)]
*  That adds 10 days and thousands of miles to their trips. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=43.28s)]
*  Right now, global shipping is existing as if the Suez Canal doesn't really work, straining [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=45.84s)]
*  a still-recovering world economy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=50.84s)]
*  Gabe Gutierrez is the NBC News senior White House correspondent, and he joins me now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=53.6s)]
*  Gabe, what do we know? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Hi there, Chris. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Well, as you said, the stakes are incredibly high here around the world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=60.32s)]
*  President Biden just releasing a statement saying that more than 2,000 ships so far have [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=64.52s)]
*  been forced to divert from the Red Sea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=69.52s)]
*  And we're just getting that video in of one of these airstrikes tonight. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=71.4s)]
*  And we're also hearing, Chris, from senior administration officials. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=74.92s)]
*  They are saying that these strikes, the intent was not to escalate the situation, it was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=78.4s)]
*  to degrade the capability of the Houthis to attack maritime vessels. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=83.92s)]
*  But, Chris, as you know, escalation could be a very big concern here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=88.92s)]
*  We have not yet heard from Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=93.8s)]
*  Iran's response to all this, but we have already heard from the Houthis who are promising payback. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=96.0s)]
*  So the White House trying to contain this conflict, preventing it from being a wider [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=101.12s)]
*  war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=105.68s)]
*  We don't have any indication on if there were any injuries in the strikes tonight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=106.68s)]
*  But again, the president with a very forceful statement and saying at the very end of it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=110.76s)]
*  that the U.S. will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  the free flow of international commerce. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=120.64000000000001s)]
*  So once again, President Biden saying that there could be further actions here by the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=122.92s)]
*  U.S. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  And, Chris, this is something that we have been hearing now for weeks, repeated warnings [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=128.88s)]
*  to the Houthis to stop their attacks on those vessels in the Red Sea. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=132.52s)]
*  Apparently, those warnings did not work. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=136.96s)]
*  And so tonight, the Biden administration striking back. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=139.0s)]
*  First, though, today, Donald Trump was in a place that he will be spending lots of time [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=142.24s)]
*  this year, and that is, of course, a courthouse. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=148.24s)]
*  This one was for closing arguments in the New York civil trial against the Trump Organization [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=150.96s)]
*  for Fraud. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=156.14s)]
*  The ex-president was there attempting to derail the final day with a statement to the press [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=157.68s)]
*  when he got there and a statement to the press when he left. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=161.2s)]
*  And in between, a five-minute courtroom rant in his defense, a rant that ended with the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=163.8s)]
*  judge telling Trump's lawyers, quote, control your client. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=169.12s)]
*  Trump's antics are getting most of the headlines. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=172.88s)]
*  But to my mind, the real headline of today happened before anyone arrived at the courthouse. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=175.0s)]
*  Mary, we are just days away from the caucus, and the former president is a world away from [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=181.72s)]
*  Iowa here in lower Manhattan. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  But in many ways, this was a campaign stop for Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=189.44s)]
*  He used it as a political move to rally his base, even as he faces real legal consequences [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=192.72s)]
*  for his business here in New York. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=197.8s)]
*  Here at the courthouse in New York, security is a little tighter today following a bomb [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  threat made this morning at the judge's home. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=207.28s)]
*  A bomb threat to Judge Arthur and Goran's home, his actual real home, because it's not [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=208.28s)]
*  hard to find people's addresses in the 21st century, a threat that delayed the trial this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  morning because they had to do sweeps and add extra layers of security because someone [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  had called a bomb threat into the judge's home. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=223.56s)]
*  We don't know all the particulars of that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't know who did it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=227.96s)]
*  But it appears to be the latest example of mob-style intimidation by pro-Trump MAGA loyalists [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=229.64s)]
*  that has become disturbingly common. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=237.04s)]
*  Just a part of day-to-day life in the Trump era. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=241.64s)]
*  Oh, bomb threat. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=244.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that delayed it a little bit. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=245.96s)]
*  Remember, when this trial began last fall, Judge and Goran had to slap a gag order on [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=248.28s)]
*  Trump after the former president baselessly smeared a court officer on social media saying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=253.8s)]
*  she was a political operative, including a photo of her in the Post. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=258.88s)]
*  And she and the judge were subsequently flooded with threats and not just threats, anti-Semitic [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=262.48s)]
*  slurs and harassing voicemails. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=267.16s)]
*  She reportedly got 30 threatening calls a day on her cell phone, her personal cell phone, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=269.8s)]
*  50 a day on email and social media. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=276.36s)]
*  The FBI and Homeland Security got involved. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=278.64s)]
*  The court officer, again, this is an anonymous staffer at the court basically, now needs [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=281.16s)]
*  extra security. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=286.92s)]
*  So on top of that, you now have a bomb threat at, again, the home of the judge. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  These happen in life sometimes, and we sort of say it and move past it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=294.1s)]
*  But I want you to just take a second of what your day would have been like today if it [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  started with a bomb threat at your home. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  And everything I just said is one Trump trial. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  One. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=309.92s)]
*  Trump follows a pattern of dangerous and potentially violent intimidation of people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=310.92s)]
*  who have attempted to hold Donald Trump to account under the rule of law. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  There were the death threats made last month against the Colorado Supreme Court justices [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=319.04s)]
*  who ruled Trump ineligible for the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  having supported the Capitol insurrection. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  A week later, the Secretary of State for Maine, who determined, like the Colorado court, that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=330.56s)]
*  Trump is similarly ineligible for the ballot, was a victim of a hoax emergency call that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=335.8s)]
*  a man had broken into her home, sending the police there, something called swatting, right, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=341.6s)]
*  with the idea of getting a SWAT team to show up at a person's home. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=346.56s)]
*  Then on Christmas Day, Jack Smith, the Department of Justice special counsel, was targeted with [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  one of those fake calls. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=355.16s)]
*  Someone called 911 claiming he had shot his wife. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  Just last weekend, Tonya Chutkin, the federal judge who was overseeing Trump's criminal [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=361.44s)]
*  trial for election interference, when police responded to a false report of a shooting [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=365.8s)]
*  at her house. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=371.32s)]
*  She was home at the time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=372.32s)]
*  To be clear, that was not even the first time Judge Chutkin was threatened over her work [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=374.44s)]
*  on this trial. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=379.4s)]
*  A Texas woman was arrested and charged with threatening a federal judge who was overseeing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=381.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's election case in Washington, D.C. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=385.92s)]
*  Police had already increased security around U.S. District Judge Tonya Chutkin after the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=389.56s)]
*  former president demanded her recusal last week. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=393.96s)]
*  Prosecutors say the 43-year-old defendant left a threatening voicemail message for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=397.64s)]
*  Chutkin saying, quote, if Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=401.6s)]
*  That was from this past August. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=408.4s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, we just began this week with Trump's lawyer in federal court making [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=409.4s)]
*  the argument that he could send SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival and face [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=414.44s)]
*  zero sanctions or accountability or legal consequences so long as he held on to 34 loyal [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=419.52s)]
*  votes in the Senate. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=425.04s)]
*  Now, that is the most extreme version of Trump's openly fascistic vision of politics and power. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=426.48s)]
*  But what I want to stress to you tonight, on a day that began with a bomb threat at [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=432.72s)]
*  the home of a judge overseeing a trial, is the banal daily version of those politics [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=436.84s)]
*  is here already. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=441.72s)]
*  It's not a hypothetical. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  That version is people that cross Donald Trump in pursuit of holding him accountable to the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  law face constant threats of violence and intimidation and harassment and sometimes [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  actual violence. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  Most obvious example being, of course, January 6th when he told people to march to the Capitol [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=460.76000000000005s)]
*  and he said it will be wild. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  And after they had ransacked the Capitol and he watched them do it, he went after his Vice [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=467.0s)]
*  President Mike Pence who was in a secure location with the Secret Service painting a target [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=471.12s)]
*  on the man's back, putting Pence in genuine physical peril with rioters erecting a gallows [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=476.2s)]
*  with a noose. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=481.52s)]
*  Trump's celebration of violent threats against his perceived antagonist goes back years. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=484.48s)]
*  So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=490.68s)]
*  you? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=495.16s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=496.16s)]
*  Okay? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=497.16s)]
*  Just knock the hell out. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=498.16s)]
*  I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=499.36s)]
*  I promise. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=502.28s)]
*  And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=503.28s)]
*  them thrown in rough. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=507.92s)]
*  I said, please don't be too nice. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=509.92s)]
*  I love the old days. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=513.04s)]
*  You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=514.04s)]
*  They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=517.56s)]
*  Like to punch them in the face, I'll tell you. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=521.88s)]
*  People hear this message loud and clear, no matter how much he tries to cover it in the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=528.16s)]
*  cadence of comedy. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  People like, for instance, real people like Cesar Sayoc. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=535.36s)]
*  Remember that name? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=537.76s)]
*  The devoted MAGA fan who went to lots of Trump rallies in the lead up to the 2018 midterms. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=539.0s)]
*  You may know him better as the MAGA bomber who on the eve of those midterms made a list [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=545.36s)]
*  of people he saw as enemies of Donald Trump and mailed them pipe bombs. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=549.36s)]
*  People like Joe Biden and George Soros and Barack Obama. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=554.88s)]
*  And then there was the attack on Nancy Pelosi's elderly husband, Paul, who on the eve of the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=558.08s)]
*  next midterms in 2022 was nearly killed in his home with a hammer by a man who had fallen [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=562.44s)]
*  down a right-wing rabbit hole in the internet. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=567.76s)]

*  And what did Trump do? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=573.12s)]
*  What does he still do today? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  He jokes about that attack. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  Continuously, it's part of his routine. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=578.72s)]
*  Sending the message to everyone who listens to him that it was funny and it was good that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=580.72s)]
*  the man nearly killed Paul Pelosi with a hammer in his home. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=585.68s)]
*  That that is a funny thing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=590.4s)]
*  And he's out there doing it right now, just the other day. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=593.8s)]
*  After the immunity argument where his lawyers argue he could order the assassination of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  political rivals, Trump comes outside to threaten violence. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=601.9599999999999s)]
*  He said there will be, quote, bedlam in the country if he doesn't get immunity from prosecution [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  for his crimes. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=609.28s)]
*  It's the same thing he did when he told his supporters before January 6th, be there. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=611.4799999999999s)]
*  It will be wild. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=615.6s)]
*  Then he told them Mike Pence didn't have the guts to do what needed to be done. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=617.72s)]
*  Like we all understand what's happening here, right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  All of us. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  You think it's a coincidence, a coincidence that this week after he said there would be [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=626.76s)]
*  bedlam there was a bomb threat directed at the judge in his New York trial? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=630.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=634.16s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=635.16s)]
*  But I do know then when you look at the worst case, most intolerable incursion of essentially [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=636.16s)]
*  fascistic violence by the MAGA faction combined with Trump's legal arguments in court, you [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=643.32s)]
*  have to consider that we are already living with a version of it in America today, every [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=649.6400000000001s)]
*  day. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=653.96s)]
*  Earlier today, Senator Brian Schatz gave a floor speech calling attention to just how [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=656.96s)]
*  dangerous this all is. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=659.88s)]
*  In the authoritarian future that he's clamoring for, he gets to do anything he wants, wielding [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=662.6s)]
*  power in the presidency and zero repercussions. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=669.6s)]
*  That's not a president. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=673.96s)]
*  That's a dictator. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=675.4s)]
*  That's not equal justice under the law. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=676.84s)]
*  That's one law for Trump and another for everybody else. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  Think about what they're saying and ask yourselves, are you comfortable with that? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=682.0s)]
*  I for one am not. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=686.28s)]
*  Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat from Hawaii joins me now. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=687.88s)]
*  Senator I like what you had to say on the floor about the sort of vision that's laid [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=692.0s)]
*  out. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=696.24s)]
*  Or if that, I mean we all, we took those hearings live, those arguments in the circuit [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=697.24s)]
*  court live, we let our show on it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=704.04s)]
*  Has it penetrated your world, Congress is back in session, you guys are all in the Senate, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=706.88s)]
*  just what was being argued a few blocks from you? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=712.6s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=715.28s)]
*  That's why I gave the floor remarks. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=717.4s)]
*  Now we're in the middle of a bunch of very important battles around an emergency supplemental [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=719.0s)]
*  appropriations process and all the rest of the negotiations. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=724.64s)]
*  And so you can understand why, you know, we're trying to do the work over here. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=727.72s)]
*  But that's why I went to the floor is that I do not think that the American public and [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  even the American political community is sufficiently alarmed. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=735.6s)]
*  Everything you said is right. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=739.56s)]
*  And I just want to emphasize one essential point, which is that now they are lawyering [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=740.56s)]
*  this up, right? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=746.4399999999999s)]
*  There was a point at which he was individually acting in an irresponsible way and essentially [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=748.2s)]
*  engaging in stochastic terrorism. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=753.44s)]
*  But it is much different when the official position of Trump's lawyers is that he could [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=755.96s)]
*  order a murder of his political rivals using SEAL Team 6. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=762.6s)]
*  And that would be up to the legislature to determine whether or not it was criminal. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=767.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just it's a new Rubicon we've passed. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think the American public has to wake up to the fact that, look, it's very exhausting [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=775.6400000000001s)]
*  to follow Trump. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=779.96s)]
*  Certainly, if you're not a political person, exhausting to constantly hear, did you hear [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=781.2s)]
*  what that guy said? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=785.24s)]
*  My God, it's crazy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=786.24s)]
*  American democracy is at stake. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=787.24s)]
*  But American democracy is at stake. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=789.1600000000001s)]
*  And this is a new turn for him where he's taking the official position that he gets [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=792.12s)]
*  to do whatever he wants. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=796.36s)]
*  I want to just follow up on this, since I have you here and you're a U.S. senator who [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=798.2800000000001s)]
*  voted in both of those impeachment trials. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=801.08s)]
*  Because it seems to me your view on this is quite germane, which is to say the argument [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=804.24s)]
*  is that the Senate knew, because it was clear in the Constitution, that the only way the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=809.44s)]
*  man could face criminal repercussions afterwards would be to be convicted in the Senate, despite [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=815.2s)]
*  the fact that Trump's own lawyers and your fellow Republican senators made the opposite [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  argument. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=825.84s)]
*  So as a U.S. Senator, was that your understanding of the Constitution? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=826.84s)]
*  No, it never was. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=830.2s)]
*  Anybody can be found criminally liable for a crime, including the President of the United [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  States, including the Vice President, including a United States Senator. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=840.12s)]
*  You break the law, you have to go to jail. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=842.6s)]
*  Now, when you're doing an impeachment trial, you're trying to measure not whether or not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=844.9200000000001s)]
*  someone committed a statutory crime, which this is a violate specific federal laws, but [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=848.72s)]
*  rather high crime and misdemeanor, basically a crime against the public and against the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=853.96s)]
*  country. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=857.72s)]
*  So it is a different standard, but you're right. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=858.72s)]
*  Peter McConnell in particular voted against impeachment and said that the proper jurisdiction [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=861.16s)]
*  for this is in the criminal justice system. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=866.0s)]
*  And now Trump's lawyers are essentially arguing the opposite, which is, I know we said the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=868.92s)]
*  proper venue for this was not the Senate, but now that we're in the criminal justice [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=873.84s)]
*  system, you got to go back to the Senate. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=877.72s)]
*  And so, look, I mean, calls of hypocrisy are rarely particularly effective in politics. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=879.92s)]
*  I do think that however this thing polls, that we are underestimating the power of standing [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=886.12s)]
*  up for American style democracy and for peace and stability in the Republic. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=892.96s)]
*  And this former president is now using his white shoe law firm, making a very explicit [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=897.76s)]
*  argument that not only can he violate the law, but he can use the American military [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=903.24s)]
*  against his political opponents. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=907.4s)]
*  It's not like he's saying he can not pay his taxes or jaywalk or use an illegal drug. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=909.12s)]
*  He's saying through his lawyers, I can use the most powerful military in the world against [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=914.24s)]
*  my political opponents. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=919.44s)]
*  And if I've got 34 votes in the Senate to acquit, I get to do whatever I want. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=921.04s)]
*  On this on this final point of the the atmosphere that's been created as someone who was in [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=926.52s)]
*  the Capitol on January 6th on that day and and also who lives in public life. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=930.88s)]
*  And again, you know, I want to be I want to try to be as fair as possible here, which [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=935.96s)]
*  is to say that across the spectrum, people face nasty phone calls. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=940.94s)]
*  They face death threats. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=945.98s)]
*  They face swatting. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=946.98s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, I think, was a victim of this. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=947.98s)]
*  So this is despicable behavior in all of its permutations across the ideological spectrum. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=949.74s)]
*  But it does seem to me there's a particular difference here, which is Trump's obvious [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=955.7s)]
*  encouragement of it, failure to condemn it, sort of stoking of it, which just is different [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=960.62s)]
*  than I think almost basically any political figure, again, across the partisan or ideological [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHRvJHbtu4&t=965.0600000000001s)]
