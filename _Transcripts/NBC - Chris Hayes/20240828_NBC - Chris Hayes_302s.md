# Trump embraces RFK Jr and all of his baggage—including the whale juice
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc)
*  Robert Kennedy Jr. is officially on Team Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=0.0s)]
*  You may have heard this. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  The former independent candidate for president [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=3.64s)]
*  was, I think, widely understood to be a Republican spoiler [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=5.92s)]
*  hoping to lure votes away from Democrats in November, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=8.76s)]
*  all but confirmed that speculation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=11.48s)]
*  when he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump on Friday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=13.68s)]
*  Now, Trump has gone one step further [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=16.92s)]
*  and appointed RFK Jr. to his potential transition team. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  And while the former president has associated himself [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  with a number of cranks over the years, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=24.88s)]
*  I mean, the guy had like dinner with a literal neo-Nazi, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=26.28s)]
*  Kennedy is his own special kind of problematic. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=29.68s)]
*  And so if Trump is going to tie himself to a guy like that, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=33.16s)]
*  he and his campaign really do deserve to inherit [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=35.6s)]
*  all the baggage that comes with him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=39.0s)]
*  I was driving up maybe really early, like seven, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=41.92s)]
*  and that woman in a van in front of me [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=46.28s)]
*  hit a bear and killed it, a young bear. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=49.4s)]
*  So I pulled over and I picked up the bear [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=53.68s)]
*  and put him in the back of my van [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=57.8s)]
*  because I was going to skin the bear [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=59.720000000000006s)]
*  and it was very good condition. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  And I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  I had to go to the airport and the bear was in my car [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=66.92s)]
*  and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=69.8s)]
*  I had an old bike in my car [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=72.0s)]
*  that somebody asked me to get rid of it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=73.4s)]
*  I said, let's go put the bear in the Central Park [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=75.0s)]
*  and we'll make it look like he got in by a bike. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=77.2s)]
*  Kennedy shared that video himself. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=81.48s)]
*  By the way, note the Roseanne watching this story face, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=82.92s)]
*  which is amazing, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  but he wanted the world to see him telling Roseanne Barr [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=86.8s)]
*  about how he was going to stage a hit and run [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  bike versus bear accident in Central Park. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  The bear story has got nothing on the whale story. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=94.08s)]
*  Just this week, a decade old profile [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=97.16s)]
*  of RFK's daughter, Kick, resurfaced [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=99.0s)]
*  where she recounts an incident from her childhood. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=101.6s)]
*  RFK got word there was a dead whale washed up [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  on Hyannis Port Beach and so of naturally he raced over there [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=107.0s)]
*  with a plot to take a souvenir [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=110.28s)]
*  and Kennedy cut the dead whale's head off [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=112.4s)]
*  with a chainsaw and then he took the decapitated whale head [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=116.48s)]
*  and he bungee corded it to the roof of the family minivan [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=120.0s)]
*  and drove five hours back to New York [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=122.92s)]
*  with his family in the car. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  As his daughter remembers it, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  and I'm gonna try to get through this passage, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  every time he accelerated on the highway, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=130.6s)]
*  whale juice would pour into the windows of the car. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=132.52s)]
*  It was the rankest thing on the planet. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=134.52s)]
*  We all had plastic bags over our heads [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=136.52s)]
*  with mouth holes cut out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=138.48s)]
*  People on the highway were giving us the finger, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=140.12s)]
*  but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=141.96s)]
*  That's, well, that's just the tip of the iceberg [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to Kennedy and dead animals. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=148.52s)]
*  There's also this really strange picture [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=149.96s)]
*  with a barbecued animal carcass [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=152.44000000000003s)]
*  which Kennedy claims with a goat or a lamb, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=154.56s)]
*  really who's to say. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=156.8s)]
*  Vanity Fair reports he sent the picture to her friend [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=158.08s)]
*  implying it was a dog, which is weird. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that's weird. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  That's a weird picture. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  We could say weird, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  Then of course there was the admission from Kennedy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=166.56s)]
*  that he had a literal brain worm. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=168.28000000000003s)]
*  According to a deposition he said that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=171.0s)]
*  an abnormality in his brain scan was caused by a worm [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  that got into my brain and ate a portion of it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=176.68s)]
*  and then died. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=178.6s)]
*  And I have to say, given what it seems like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=179.44s)]
*  he's been eating, I'm not that surprised. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=181.12s)]
*  But far, far more seriously, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=184.32s)]
*  Robert Kennedy has promoted consistently [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=187.44s)]
*  false, dangerous, and deranged conspiracy theories. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=190.24s)]
*  He is probably the most, one of the most prominent [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=192.32s)]
*  anti-vaccine activists in the world. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=195.0s)]
*  And it was he and his ilk, but really him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, almost chief among everyone [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=200.44s)]
*  who helped spread deadly lies about vaccination [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=202.24s)]
*  that ultimately cost the lies. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=204.56s)]
*  And I'm not, this is not hyperbole, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=206.6s)]
*  literally hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=208.24s)]
*  during COVID. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=211.08s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people died who didn't need to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=211.92s)]
*  because they had been told lies about vaccines. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=214.28s)]
*  Here's the thing, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=218.16s)]
*  is still on the ballot in some states. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=219.48s)]
*  And so yeah, he's with Trump, but [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=221.16s)]
*  if you live in a blue state, you can vote for me [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=224.48s)]
*  without harming or helping President Trump [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=227.76s)]
*  or Vice President Harris. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=231.56s)]
*  In red states, the same will apply. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=233.64s)]
*  I encourage you to vote for me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  And if enough of you do vote for me, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=239.44s)]
*  and neither of the major party candidates win 270 votes, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=241.84s)]
*  which is quite possible. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=245.56s)]
*  In fact, today our polling shows them tying at 269 to 269. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  And I could conceivably still end up in the White House [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=254.12s)]
*  in a contingent election. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  Would he be the president or the brain worm? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=260.68s)]
*  Interesting question. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=263.04s)]
*  That was at his press conference to endorse Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  I endorse Trump, vote for me still. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  So this is who's been added to the already [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  very weird campaign of Donald Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=272.36s)]
*  And hey, maybe it's a strategy to make JD Vance [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  seem almost normal by comparison, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=277.16s)]
*  except that guy keeps producing new weirdness himself. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnxlNdj__Yc&t=278.64000000000004s)]
