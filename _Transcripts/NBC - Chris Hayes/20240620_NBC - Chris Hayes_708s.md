# Elie Mystal shreds far-right Supreme Court: 'They're on a revenge tour'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. All eyes on the Supreme Court this week again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=0.0s)]
*  As the end of its term quickly approaches and the justice dragged their feet on issuing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=5.2s)]
*  some of their most hotly anticipated decisions. Today the court did release four opinions [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=9.64s)]
*  but there was still no ruling on the most pressing case of the year, the one that has [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=14.38s)]
*  a clock ticking against it. And that of course is Donald Trump's claim that he is immune [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=19.6s)]
*  from being prosecuted for any of his actions while in office. The court heard arguments [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=24.86s)]
*  in that case, Trump the United States, all the way back in February. We've now been [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=29.5s)]
*  waiting 113 days and counting for a decision while every day that passes makes it more [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=33.76s)]
*  and more likely that Donald Trump will not face legal accountability before the election [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=39.1s)]
*  for his attempted insurrection. But the voters will not be provided information about whether [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=43.74s)]
*  or not he is guilty of this grave crime. And amid that backdrop it really feels like this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=47.82s)]
*  Supreme Court is acting less like a court and more like a right wing legislature appointed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=53.42s)]
*  for life. The conservative majority including three justices appointed by Donald Trump increasingly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=58.2s)]
*  behaves like they have a political agenda to carry out. And as we have seen particularly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=64.76s)]
*  with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas they are making incredible ethical compromises [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=69.62s)]
*  to get it all done. Now of course there are some key differences, constitutional differences [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=73.98s)]
*  between the court and a legislature right? When a new class comes to Congress for example [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  they have campaigned on a proactive agenda to voters that they plan to enact and then [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=85.56s)]
*  they come into Congress and they understand that there's a time limit on their plans with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=89.28s)]
*  elections happening every few years and political capital ebbing. So they try to get moving [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=93.68s)]
*  quickly on their agenda and legislators of course are not bound by precedent the way [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=98.92s)]
*  the court is or at least used to be. If the party in power does not like a piece of legislation [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=103.9s)]
*  previously passed, say the Affordable Care Act, they can campaign on repealing it and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  they're welcome to try to repeal it as many times they like. Of course if the legislation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=114.42s)]
*  is as popular as the Affordable Care Act proved to be they may not have the votes they need [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=118.9s)]
*  to succeed. But the Supreme Court doesn't work the same way or at least it's not supposed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=122.54s)]
*  to right? The court is supposed to rule on very difficult matters of law and controversies [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=128.26s)]
*  as they arise out there in the world. They don't have the power like legislators to introduce [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=135.38s)]
*  a bill or a case they really want to rule on. They have to wait for an issue to come [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=141.84s)]
*  before them. But the key thing about this MAGA court is that everyone in their right [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=146.84s)]
*  wing universe fully understands they basically want to be a legislature. They do have an [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=151.84s)]
*  ambitious agenda. They do feel like time is of the essence. And so the conservative institutions [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  and groups are constantly teeing up the issues they want the courts to hear. They're all [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=164.18s)]
*  kind of working together even if they don't communicate with each other as such. I mean [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=168.94s)]
*  we saw this in Black and Right after Donald Trump's third Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=173.46s)]
*  Barrett who was a clear vote against abortion rights was confirmed in the days before that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=178.56s)]
*  election while Ruth Bader Ginsburg had just passed away. When that happened Mississippi's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  Attorney General saw her opening and she went back to the court because she knew there was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=190.3s)]
*  now a 6-3 court to explicitly amend her filing to explicitly ask them to overturn Roe v. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=194.36s)]
*  Wade. She didn't do that before but when she saw the number she said actually let's go [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=201.86s)]
*  whole hog here. And of course it worked right. They did exactly that two years ago this coming [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=206.16s)]
*  Monday. The abortion bill Mefa Pristone case the court heard this term was exact same kind [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=211.24s)]
*  of situation. Right wing anti-abortion activists look at the makeup of this court they said [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=216.84s)]
*  Hey let's take a shot at this. Let's try to ban Mefa Pristone nationwide via judicial [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=221.42s)]
*  fiat. And their argument was preposterous claiming the Food and Drug Administration [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  should not have approved Mefa Pristone as an abortion medication and that doctors who [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=231.64s)]
*  missed out on giving birth had suffered an injury and therefore had standing. That was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  a step too far even for this court which unanimously dismissed the case on standing grounds last [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=241.6s)]
*  week. And the same circumstances surrounded the tax case the court did decide today. Again [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=247.36s)]
*  conservative think tank brought this case more of the United States. It's a little complicated [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  it was a tax error repatriation Trump error tax repatriation but what is essentially an [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=258.76s)]
*  effort to get the court to rule preemptively against the possibility of a wealth tax a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=263.44s)]
*  policy that progressives including Senator Elizabeth Warren have opposed. Now once again [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=268.3s)]
*  The argument went too far even for the MAGA court. They rejected the challenge this time [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=273.24s)]
*  seven to two. But again why not take a shot right. And we're seeing another case just [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=277.48s)]
*  in the last 48 hours teeing up in Louisiana where Republican Governor Jeff Landry just [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  signed a bill requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public classroom [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  at public schools in the state. Now under current precedent the law is obviously unconstitutional. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  I would say it's obviously unconstitutional even if it wasn't under current precedent. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=301.12s)]
*  But there is plenty of established precedent here. In fact in 1980 the Supreme Court knocked [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  down a very similar law ruling that it was prohibited under the separation clause of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  the First Amendment. But Governor Landry says and I quote I can't wait to be sued. And of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=314.48s)]
*  course he can't. That makes sense because this is all part of the transparent conservative [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=321.04s)]
*  plan to take advantage of this court that's behaving more like a legislature eager to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=325.44s)]
*  act on these right wing issues and do it now. Well they have this six three majority [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=330.5s)]
*  before something can change. Now sometimes they really do overstep right. They try to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=335.62s)]
*  send things there that just a little too nutty even for these justices. I know seven to. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=340.98s)]
*  But that's for now right. Not written in stone again. Once you just throw out the notion [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=347.22s)]
*  of precedent. Well then the right wing also knows if Donald Trump is reelected he very [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=352.22s)]
*  well may get to replace more seats on the court and he could give them an even stronger [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=357.98s)]
*  conservative majority. And in the meantime again they might as well shoot the shot. Because [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=361.82s)]
*  what the Supreme Court has become is really an unelected lifetime legislature a majority [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=367.86s)]
*  of whom were appointed by presidents who didn't even win the popular vote. Harry Lippman is [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=373.04s)]
*  a former U.S. attorney her clerk for two previous Supreme Court justices Thurgood Marshall and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=378.44s)]
*  Anthony Kennedy. Ellie Mistel is the justice correspondent for the nation and they both [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=382.94s)]
*  join me now. First let me just ask each of you if you broadly agree and I should say [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=387.58s)]
*  this is a point that Mark Joseph Stern at Slate has made my wife Kate Shaw has made [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=393.17999999999995s)]
*  a of the folks to suit me. It is a novel insight on my part of this sort of proactive agenda [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=396.85999999999996s)]
*  acting like a legislature in terms of what cases they're reaching out and taking. But [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  does that scan to you Harry at least comparing it also to what it used to be like when you [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  clerked? Vividly and it's even stronger I think Chris than you're saying the Louisiana [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=411.74s)]
*  case is a perfect case in point. If your court that cares about precedent and the rule of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=419.1s)]
*  law what you say when a state legislature boldly enacts a flatly unconstitutional provision [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=424.3s)]
*  under the current law is forget about it that's the law of the land you have to follow it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=431.54s)]
*  maybe we'll change it and we'll see you then but until then please follow the Supremacy [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=436.42s)]
*  Clause and the law of the land. The sponsor here actually said she wants people to all [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  children to look up and see what God says is right and what God says is wrong. It's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=447.5s)]
*  really a patent violation but that it goes to show the broader repercussions of this [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=451.66s)]
*  hyper conservative court because this wasn't done with any coordination with the court [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  groups were there and they were emboldened and enthusiastic. Bring it on let's get sued [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=463.58s)]
*  knowing that they can act directly contrary to the Constitution and it's or at least as [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=470.34s)]
*  we now understand it and that's just another name for setting an agenda. We saw this very [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=475.86s)]
*  much in Dobbs as well it wasn't just when the state actually changed its law and asked [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=481.86s)]
*  the Supreme Court to do it but other states going forward violating Roe and getting away [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=489.5s)]
*  with it. That's not the way the rule of law is supposed to work however you think you're [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=495.02s)]
*  going to change it in the future. Ellie you know just to argue against myself for a moment [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=499.82s)]
*  or sort of play devil's advocate and get your response right I mean in some ways you can [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=505.74s)]
*  look at me for Pristo 9-0 you can look at the more 7-2 which were again these were like [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=509.02s)]
*  teed up by these conservative groups they were wacky wacky legal theories right and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=513.58s)]
*  in the end this very conservative court ruled against them pretty heftily you could say hey [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=518.86s)]
*  look they really are still doing law they're not just essentially doing the bidding of the right [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=523.34s)]
*  wing. What do you say to that? Well no Chris because you forgot about the guns right like any [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=528.3000000000001s)]
*  wacky legal theory that leads to mass shootings and mass deaths. Oh guess what the court is right [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=536.0600000000001s)]
*  back on schedule doing the NRA's bidding but I want to get to your question about whether or not [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=541.66s)]
*  this is new because I think it's important for people to understand that in the conservatives [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=546.46s)]
*  own mind in the republican own group think they're on their revenge tour right because from the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=551.6600000000001s)]
*  republican perspective the court has been acting like a super legislator in the 60s when it gave [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=557.82s)]
*  when it when it when it grant when it ended segregation when we've had the civil rights [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=563.74s)]
*  error and all that kind of stuff right and so they think they have made a false equivalency between [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=567.34s)]
*  treating black people and women as people with like let's put the 10th commandment back into [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=572.14s)]
*  school like it's that kind of topsy-turvy thing but they think that they are getting their revenge [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  on the 1960s and 1970s they're wrong but one of the reasons why they're wrong is because this idea [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=582.9399999999999s)]
*  that the war in court kind of superseded elected majorities in the south is kind of wrong when you [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=590.06s)]
*  remember that the 1964 civil rights act and the 1965 voting rights act were broadly popular right [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=597.02s)]
*  passed through the democratic process not the supreme court process that's the part of the story [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=604.86s)]
*  that republicans always seem to forget if they could pass a law banning abortion if they could [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=610.6999999999999s)]
*  pass a law of doing you know allowing anybody and their mother to own guns i'd like to see them try [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLddQxzr4VA&t=616.6999999999999s)]
