# Bernie Sanders says he will vote against debt ceiling deal
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ)
*  Within the next hour, the House is expected to pass the debt ceiling deal. Once it does, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the bill is going to head to the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Schumer has promised quick action. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=4.32s)]
*  I cannot stress enough that we have no margin, no margin for error. Either we proceed quickly [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=11.76s)]
*  and send this bipartisan agreement to the president's desk, or the federal government [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=19.84s)]
*  will default for the first time ever. There are still lots of timing negotiations going on in the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=25.04s)]
*  Senate. Several senators have already said they will be voting no among them. Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=30.48s)]
*  Sanders said that while the debt ceiling deal could have been much worse, he cannot quote, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=36.0s)]
*  vote for a bill that takes nutrition assistance away from women, infants, children, and seniors, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=39.36s)]
*  and that fast tracks the quote, disastrous Mountain Valley pipeline at a time that the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=44.4s)]
*  future of the world is literally at stake. Senator Sanders, an independent in Vermont, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=48.96s)]
*  Chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee joins me now. Senator, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=53.919999999999995s)]
*  was this a hard or easy decision to get to on this vote once you were able to survey the 99 [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=59.28s)]
*  pages of the deal? It was not a difficult decision. Look, the bottom line is in America today, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=64.56s)]
*  we have more income and wealth inequality than we've ever had. People on top doing phenomenally [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=70.88s)]
*  well, middle class struggling, lower income people really facing desperate times. And you [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=76.4s)]
*  don't do deficit reduction in any moral sense on the backs of some of the people in this country [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  who are barely making it right now. Meanwhile, the wealthiest people in this country who are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  doing phenomenally well will pay no more in taxes. Large corporations that have raised profits, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=94.8s)]
*  seen huge increases in their profits in recent years, they're not going to be asked to pay a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=100.24s)]
*  nickel more in taxes. As you indicated, there's going to be a disastrous pipeline to be expedited [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=104.32s)]
*  at a time when the scientists tell us we've got to do exactly the opposite, cut back on [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=110.56s)]
*  fossil fuel production. So to my mind, and I should also add, in two year time, a $56 billion [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=115.84s)]
*  increase in military spending, despite the fact that the Pentagon is the only federal agency not [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  to have been audited massive waste and fraud in the Pentagon to get $56 billion more over the next [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=131.12s)]
*  two years. So here's to me the sort of argument for the deals to the extent there is one. And I [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=136.72s)]
*  don't think anyone on the Democratic side is particularly enthusiastic about this deal. In [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=142.56s)]
*  fact, you just may have seen Congresswoman Mikey Sherrill was a very centrist member of Congress. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=145.52s)]
*  She's not like waving a flag of victory around this deal. She's going to vote for it. Basically, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=150.8s)]
*  it goes like this. There is divided government, right? Spending and appropriations constitutionally [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=155.36s)]
*  originates in the House. It's going to have to be whatever the government spends this year is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=161.44s)]
*  going to have to be the product of some sort of compromise between a Republican controlled [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=166.0s)]
*  House and Democratic controlled Senate and a White House. That's just the case. And this is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=170.24s)]
*  basically about what you would expect from that kind of divided government. That's a reasonable [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=174.88s)]
*  argument. I don't think it's quite accurate. I think we could have done better through the normal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=181.12s)]
*  appropriations process. But what we are surrendering to is the Republican hijacking of the appropriations [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=184.88s)]
*  process and basically holding the world's economy hostage. And we're surrendering to that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=194.56s)]
*  And, Chris, let's be very clear. In two years' time, they're going to be back again and we're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=199.6s)]
*  going to go through this whole process again. So, you know, I think we certainly this agreement [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=204.48s)]
*  is nowhere near as bad as the Republican original proposal, which would have been devastated. But I [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=211.52s)]
*  think for a variety of reasons, the no vote is right. Okay. I got to talk about the Mountain [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Valley Project. Now, this is a pipeline that would bring natural gas down through Virginia and West [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=222.96s)]
*  Virginia into parts of the southeast. This has been hung up in courts for a long time. It is a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  priority of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who you see there. There is a special language in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=236.32s)]
*  there that blanket that protects this from judicial review, just statutorily just comes in, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=242.0s)]
*  takes it out of the courts, gives it the permits it needs to get built. And the craziest thing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=249.36s)]
*  about this is Tim Kaine, who represents the state of Virginia, through which the pipeline would run, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=253.84s)]
*  says that no one from the White House called him or asked him about this, and he just found out [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  about it in the press. What do you think of that? Well, I think it is outrageous. I mean, in the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=263.92s)]
*  bottom line, it's not only how they treated Tim. The bottom line is caving into Manchin, caving into [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=269.68s)]
*  the fossil fuel industry. Look, it is nobody who's watching doesn't understand that climate [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=276.0s)]
*  change is an existential threat to this country and the world. We've got to transform our energy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=282.64s)]
*  system, not build more pipelines. So this is just one more reason why I think the no vote is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=288.0s)]
*  appropriate. There is going to be an appropriations process after this. And one of the silver linings [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=294.64s)]
*  here, as I understand it, is that if the no deal is struck, the cuts end up being slightly more [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=304.8s)]
*  favorable to Democrats than a deal being struck because defense spending will be capped in a no [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=312.0s)]
*  deal scenario. Do you think that gives you a little bit of leverage as you go through the quote unquote [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=318.24s)]
*  normal appropriations process here? The answer is we will see. Certainly our Republican friends [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=324.32s)]
*  wanted to actually increase military spending far more than is in this legislation. They are very [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=332.8s)]
*  concerned about the deficit, except when it comes to tax breaks for billionaires and spending more [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  money on the military. All right, Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=345.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZvep-KoLQ&t=362.8s)]
