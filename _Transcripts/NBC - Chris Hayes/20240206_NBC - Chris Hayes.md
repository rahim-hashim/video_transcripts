# All In with Chris Hayes - Feb. 6  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc)
*  Tonight on All In... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=0.0s)]
*  The court has denied Trump's argument. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=3.56s)]
*  The D.C. Circuit Court makes its ruling. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=7.92s)]
*  For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=11.18s)]
*  Citizen Trump should stand trial for January 6th. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=17.46s)]
*  This is a unanimous body blow to each and every one of Donald Trump's arguments. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Tonight, special coverage with Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell on what today's decision [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=29.32s)]
*  means and what happens next. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=33.4s)]
*  Having immunity is so important and I hope the Supreme Court has the courage to do that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=36.4s)]
*  Legal analysis with Lisa Rubin, Katie Fang, Harry Lippman and Joyce Vance and David Plouffe [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=41.96s)]
*  on our frontrunner running to stay out of jail. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=46.64s)]
*  I love that beautiful woman right there with the mugshot. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=50.0s)]
*  Plus Congressman Adam Schiff on the trial of Donald Trump and the spectacular failure [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  of House Republicans. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=58.36s)]
*  The nays are 216. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=59.36s)]
*  The resolution is not adopted. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=62.36s)]
*  All In starts right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=66.24s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=72.6s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=73.6s)]
*  Welcome to a special edition of All In on an enormously consequential day for American [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=74.6s)]
*  rule of law and democracy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=78.88s)]
*  Just a moment, I'll be joined by my good friends Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell to discuss [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  today's landmark ruling by a federal appeals court against Donald Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=85.28s)]
*  In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel of the D.C. Appellate Court ruled that Donald [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=90.96s)]
*  Trump is not immune from being criminally prosecuted for his attempts to steal the 2020 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=95.92s)]
*  election and overthrow our democracy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=101.56s)]
*  It is a thorough defeat for the ex-president, clearing the way for his trial for those alleged [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  crimes to proceed, barring an intervention by the Supreme Court, which we will of course [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=110.12s)]
*  get to in a moment. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=114.34s)]
*  In their lengthy opinion, the judges explained, quote, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=115.98s)]
*  Of course, citizen Trump has been charged on four felony counts related to his attempt [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=134.5s)]
*  to steal the election, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  Federal counsel Jack Smith brought those charges last summer and the case was assigned to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=144.16s)]
*  district judge Tanya Chutkin, who has been very clear about her desire to move the case [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=148.24s)]
*  along quickly, arguing that there is a societal interest in providing a speedy trial. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=153.48s)]
*  She scheduled the trial to begin on March 4th. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=159.6s)]
*  But of course, Donald Trump wants to delay as much as possible in the hopes that he could [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=162.24s)]
*  win an election, land back in the White House before a trial can even begin, where he can [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=167.68s)]
*  dismiss this case from his perch as the guy who tells the Department of Justice what to do. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=172.8s)]
*  And so to that end, he launched an appeal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, this is sort of a crucial thing to understand. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  It's one of the very few kinds of appeals that are allowed before the trial even starts [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=184.0s)]
*  in a federal criminal case. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  It's called interlocutory appeal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  It means you're appealing before they even try you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  And in this appeal, he claims that he has absolute immunity, that he cannot even be tried. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=202.4s)]
*  That he can't even stand trial. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=202.72s)]
*  He can't be prosecuted for anything he did while he was the president. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=204.16s)]
*  This appeal was, from the beginning, clearly a kind of legal Hail Mary to prevent the trial [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=209.44s)]
*  from starting next month. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=214.88s)]
*  It's been pretty clear from the start. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=216.48s)]
*  He absolutely should lose on the merits. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=218.56s)]
*  In fact, Judge Chutkin considered this appeal and swiftly rejected Trump's initial motion [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=221.6s)]
*  to dismiss the charges against him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=226.72s)]
*  He then brought his claim to the appeals court. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=228.88s)]
*  That's one level above Judge Chutkin, putting the whole case on hold while those judges [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=230.96s)]
*  considered his legally dubious argument. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=236.0s)]
*  Now, there's some complicated stuff about jurisdiction in the opinion, but you do not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=239.6s)]
*  have to be a lawyer to appreciate how plainly Trump's claim clashes with the most basic [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  structure of our democratic government. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=251.92s)]
*  Could a president order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=254.56s)]
*  That's an official act in order to seal Team 6? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  He would have to be and would speedily be, you know, impeached and convicted before the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  criminal prosecution. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  What if he weren't? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=269.76s)]
*  There would be no criminal prosecution, no criminal liability for that? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=270.56s)]
*  Chief Justice's opinion, where we're against Madison and our Constitution and the plain [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  language of the impeachment judgment clause all clearly presuppose that what the founders [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=281.36s)]
*  were concerned about was not- [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=285.6s)]
*  I asked you a yes or no question. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=286.88s)]
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=290.16s)]
*  impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  So your answer is no. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=302.0s)]
*  My answer is qualified yes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=304.32s)]
*  There's a political process that would have to occur under the structure of our Constitution, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=305.68s)]
*  which require impeachment and conviction by the Senate. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=309.44s)]
*  So you gotta get impeachment and conviction before you can stand trial for having SEAL Team [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=312.56s)]
*  6 kill your political rival. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=318.64s)]
*  That was a month ago. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=320.08s)]
*  And of course, a former president- and what basically they ruled today is that a former [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=322.08s)]
*  president cannot commit a crime while in office and never face any legal consequences. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=327.04s)]
*  The ruling takes down each of Trump's claims. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  One of his main assertions is the prospect of being prosecuted would, quote, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=335.2s)]
*  inhibit a sitting president's ability to act fearlessly and impartially. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=339.84s)]
*  Basically, it would make it too hard to do the job. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=344.08s)]
*  He would be too stressed to be president. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  The court counters that every other president in history has somehow managed it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=349.52s)]
*  Quote, past presidents have understood themselves to be subject to impeachment and criminal [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=354.0s)]
*  liability, at least under certain circumstances, so the possibility of chilling executive [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  action is already in effect. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=361.76s)]
*  And former presidents clearly knew they were not, quote, wholly immune from criminal liability. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=364.0s)]
*  For instance, just look at Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, which both former presidents [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=368.96s)]
*  evidently believed was necessary to avoid Nixon's post-resignation indictment. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  Court also argues there is an important deterrent effect that would be lost if presidents were [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  totally immune from criminal prosecution. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  Quote, instead of inhibiting the president's lawful discretionary action, the prospect of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  federal criminal liability might serve as a structural benefit to deter possible abuses [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=391.76s)]
*  of power and criminal behavior. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=396.64s)]
*  In other words, maybe we want to have a system that incentivizes those in power, like the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=398.96s)]
*  president, to think twice about whether they're committing a felony before they do something. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=403.36s)]
*  Am I doing a crime? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=408.64s)]
*  This is a felony. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=410.24s)]
*  Should we do this? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=411.68s)]
*  And of course, our system is built as three co-equal branches of government. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=413.44s)]
*  The president is the head of just one of them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=417.44s)]
*  He is not above the other two. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=420.24s)]
*  He is certainly not above the law. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=421.68s)]
*  Quote, former President Trump's stance would collapse our system of separated powers by [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=423.44s)]
*  placing the president beyond the reach of all three branches. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=428.32s)]
*  Presidential immunity against federal indictment would mean that, as to the president, the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  Congress could not legislate, the executive could not prosecute, the judiciary could not review. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=439.68s)]
*  above the law for all time thereafter. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=443.76s)]
*  The appeals court gave Donald Trump and his lawyers a deadline of February 12th, that's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=446.32s)]
*  next Monday, to appeal this decision to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=449.68s)]
*  That's the last step. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  And he says he will do that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=455.2s)]
*  And then it will be up to the Supreme Court justices to decide if they want to take up [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=457.36s)]
*  his case. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=461.2s)]
*  They don't have to, at all. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=462.0s)]
*  In fact, you know, they reject most cases that are presented to them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=463.6s)]
*  If they say no, which is a possibility, then this ruling just stands. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=467.28s)]
*  And Judge Chutkin can get the trial back on her schedule and at her discretion. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=471.28s)]
*  If the Supreme Court does decide to hear Trump's case, then he will have secured another delay. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, again, the merits of the case remain the same. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=480.4s)]
*  His argument is incredibly flimsy, almost insultingly so. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=483.92s)]
*  And he most likely will not win. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=488.72s)]
*  I don't think there's five votes on that court for this fecacca nonsense. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=490.72s)]
*  But the clock will be running. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=496.4s)]
*  And that, of course, is the entire point. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=497.92s)]
*  I'm joined now by the president of the United States, John Kerry. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=501.36s)]
*  I'm joined now by Rachel Maddow, host of the Rachel Maddow Show, and Lawrence O'Donnell, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  host of The Last Word. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=508.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=510.23999999999995s)]
*  Let me get first sort of top line reactions from you, Rachel, to the court's decision today. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, first of all, just kudos on fecacca nonsense at the end of the A-block. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=516.88s)]
*  It was just, I aspire to end up there at the end of a monologue, an explanatory one like this. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=520.72s)]
*  I think, Chris, that the thing that was interesting to me about this ruling was [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=528.56s)]
*  that from the very beginning—you're right that there is complicated jurisdictional stuff. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=533.68s)]
*  There's stuff that lawyers will get that other people won't get in here. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=537.68s)]
*  But from the very beginning, it was very blunt on stuff that there's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=540.8s)]
*  been an effort to be fuzzy about by people in the political arena. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=545.04s)]
*  It says at the very outset of the ruling, there was not a peaceful transition of power. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=548.16s)]
*  The reason the Congress was attacked, that resulted from Trump's rally, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=553.04s)]
*  from which thousands of people then marched to the Capitol and attacked Congress. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=559.3599999999999s)]
*  It's very blunt about those things. It calls it an unprecedented assault on our system of government. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=563.28s)]
*  It's just very blunt about these things that there have been efforts to obfuscate. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=568.48s)]
*  And I thought that was helpful. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=572.8s)]
*  But I also just thought it was helpful, I think, for us as a country in talking about this, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  that they did outright mock the claims that you have to be impeached and convicted in the Senate [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=580.4s)]
*  before you could be put on trial for committing murder or committing any of these other crimes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=586.88s)]
*  And I think that it's good that they basically rebutted what I think of as the common sense claim here, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  which is that other presidents like Richard Nixon, like even Bill Clinton, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=598.24s)]
*  like other presidents in their real lives have shown, even Trump in his presidency has shown [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=602.08s)]
*  and has articulated that they knew they could be put on trial after they were out of office. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  They've all known it. It's a common sense thing that many presidents have conceded, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=612.64s)]
*  including Trump himself, while he was being impeached. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  And those things, I think, they just operate in the public sphere as well as they operate in the law. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=619.84s)]
*  And we really need that. We need that from the judiciary right now so people really understand what's going on here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=625.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's two places in particular they make those citations. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=630.64s)]
*  So the Nixon-Ford example, which I think is the most famous to all of us, like, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=633.12s)]
*  it was the biggest story in the country at the time that Ford was prospectively pardoning Richard Nixon. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=637.04s)]
*  And literally everyone in the country understood that the reason he was doing that, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=642.0s)]
*  the reason Nixon was accepting it is because he was probably going to be indicted and facing the court [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=645.2s)]
*  and probably going to be indicted and facing criminal prosecution. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=648.96s)]
*  But there's also Bill Clinton cutting a deal on his way out the door of the White House [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=650.72s)]
*  to basically have his law license suspended in exchange basically for not being prosecuted, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=654.64s)]
*  another point at which clearly he thought it was possible. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=660.24s)]
*  And then, Rachel, your point, they also cite Trump's own lawyers at his impeachment trial, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=664.88s)]
*  which I thought was interesting, whether that was going to make the opinion saying, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=669.36s)]
*  this doesn't say you can't go and indict the guy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=673.84s)]
*  Literally, his other lawyers, different lawyers, say that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=676.56s)]
*  So yeah, all three of those examples, which I think are sort of common sense historical [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=679.52s)]
*  examples rather than like arcane legal ones, are in the opinion very persuasive. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=683.52s)]
*  Lawrence, what did you think? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=687.12s)]
*  Yeah, so we're talking about President Bill Clinton, Yale Law School graduate, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=687.76s)]
*  President Richard Nixon, Duke Law School graduate. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=692.8s)]
*  They firmly believe that the president can absolutely be charged with crimes, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=696.16s)]
*  certainly after leaving office. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=703.28s)]
*  And so this is one of those opinions that says to America, it says to every high school history [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=705.2s)]
*  student in America, you're not crazy. It's what you thought. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=712.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=715.84s)]
*  It's what we've always thought for the entire history of the republic. This is the way it is. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  And if we think back to the beginning of this case, there wasn't a single legal pundit, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=721.52s)]
*  there wasn't anybody in the right wing anywhere saying, oh, well, you know, you can't indict him [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=726.32s)]
*  he's completely immune. This notion had never even been advanced by anyone until Trump's lawyers [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=732.96s)]
*  decided to advance it in this case. And so, I mean, it kind of took everyone by surprise [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=739.92s)]
*  in how outrageous it was. And what you have here now is the proof that there is a very big [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=745.84s)]
*  difference between what we call a novel case, which is this interesting issue that has never [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  floated up all the way to the Supreme Court. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=757.28s)]
*  Which is Thursday, I think it's fair to say. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=759.2s)]
*  And a crazy case, which has absolutely no conceivable basis. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=760.88s)]
*  Yeah. And there's, I mean, in some ways, I almost felt like it was, it's sort of a strange thing to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=765.68s)]
*  read the opinion because it's incredibly persuasive, Rachel, and very thorough and goes through a bunch [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=770.96s)]
*  of stuff. But at some level, it was like, the essential point was so ludicrous that it almost [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=775.68s)]
*  made me mad that we, like, this is the way the system works. And it's, you know, it's important [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=782.08s)]
*  that the system work its way through. But there was almost some sense, it was like, right, of course, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=787.2s)]
*  you know, as they went through every example, as they cited chapter and verse, as they, you know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=791.76s)]
*  limbed the lines of executive authority jurisprudence from Marbury to Youngstown and on and on and on, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=797.44s)]
*  it was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, this is precisely what it looks like, to Lawrence's point. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes. And it's what we've all known was true all along. And you're trying to say that this [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  is, you know, that we shouldn't believe our lying eyes and the presidency has always been [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=816.88s)]
*  something different. Here's all the ways in which that's not true. That's absolutely right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=820.88s)]
*  I will say that the other piece of this that I was just pleased to read is that there is an element [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=825.28s)]
*  of the defense that Trump has mounted, both in public relations, both as a public relations matter, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=833.76s)]
*  but also as a legal matter to some extent. And I think of it as the mirrored sunglasses problem. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=840.48s)]
*  Like, do we really want to be a country in which some lieutenant colonel in mirrored sunglasses [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=848.64s)]
*  has every incentive to hold on to power for his entire natural life? Because the expectation is [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=854.64s)]
*  that once you're no longer holding the reins of power, you're going to be prosecuted by your [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=860.32s)]
*  political enemies and by your political successors. I mean, it sucks to be a country where former [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=864.48s)]
*  presidents get prosecuted because that's a lousy thing about countries in which that's a [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=869.68s)]
*  regular dynamic in which those prosecutions are politically motivated and they're junk prosecutions, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=876.4799999999999s)]
*  but they're used for political purposes. Trump has made that case both in the courtroom and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=882.16s)]
*  outside the court. And I've always felt like it's his strongest point. Obviously, the solution to [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  that as a country is don't elect freaking criminals to be presidents. But you also got the judges today [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=891.76s)]
*  in the DC circuit arguing against it and saying, listen, we have ways in our system of dealing with [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=898.4000000000001s)]
*  meritless and harassing prosecution. We have systems within our judiciary that prevent that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=905.76s)]
*  And so the idea that once you're prosecuted for crimes, you're going to then prosecute and [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=913.12s)]
*  everybody's going to prosecute people for nothing from here on out. No, the judiciary is here to [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=918.48s)]
*  make sure that doesn't happen. And we know that it won't. And seeing that asserted by this panel [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=923.2s)]
*  of judges to me actually made me feel better about that problem for the first time since this whole [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=929.2s)]
*  merry-go-round started spinning around. Yeah. And I agree with that. There's something that he says [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=934.6400000000001s)]
*  along those lines about what this will bring about that I want to talk about, because I think it's [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  actually both a defense, but it's a threat, very plainly a threat about what's going to happen. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=945.2s)]
*  So if you guys would stick around, we have a lot to get to tonight. Former January 6th committee [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=950.24s)]
*  member, Congressman Adam Schiff is here, plus David Plouffe on what this all means, the 24 election. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=954.0s)]
*  We have a team of incredible lawyers who are still poring over this decision and what it means. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=959.52s)]
*  That's all ahead. Don't go anywhere. In its unanimous decision that Donald Trump is not immune [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=963.28s)]
*  from criminal prosecution, the three-judge panel from the DC Court of Appeals writes, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  we cannot accept former President Trump's claims that a president has unbounded authority to commit [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=973.84s)]
*  crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power, the recognition and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=978.88s)]
*  implementation of election results. Still with me tonight, Rachel Maddow and Lawrence McDonald. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=983.84s)]
*  Lawrence, I want to just read this truth social post. Do we have that from the last block? Maybe [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=988.24s)]
*  that just got taken away from me. Basically, Trump has been saying time and time again [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=994.96s)]
*  that if there's no immunity, then every president, to Rachel's point in the previous block, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1000.56s)]
*  then every president will face prosecution afterwards. That always reads to me as an [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1006.16s)]
*  obvious threat. It seems to me he's saying, not just, can we show that truth social post? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1010.56s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, that must have full immunity in order to a president will be afraid to act, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  I know from personal experience, even our elections will be corrupted and under siege, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  so bad, so dangerous for a nation, save presidential immunity. Basically, he's saying, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1025.2s)]
*  I'm going to prosecute Joe Biden if I'm elected. That's the way those always read to me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1030.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't reading it as that future thing. I was just reading it as the kind of dumb Trump [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1034.72s)]
*  idea about the way the world works. But you're absolutely right. He's saying, this absolutely [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1039.92s)]
*  allows me to do it. I'll do it. What's so striking about it is that as the court points out in the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1044.24s)]
*  opinion, one thing that matters when you say, if this happens, then this will happen. What [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1050.72s)]
*  meteorology is interested in is, hey, if it comes up this way, if the track is this way, this will [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1057.44s)]
*  happen. How do we know that? Oh, because we've been studying it for a hundred years. We have a [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1062.48s)]
*  couple of hundred years of this not happening. A couple of hundred years. And the court was very [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1066.48s)]
*  impressed. The court says we're really impressed with a couple of hundred years of this absolutely [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1071.76s)]
*  not happening when the presidents believed that it could. I mean, you can go into these presidencies [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1076.64s)]
*  and discover that, yes, Franklin Roosevelt was worried that this idea might be against the law. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1083.68s)]
*  Therefore, he won't do it. Harry Truman was worried that seizing the steel mills could be [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1089.44s)]
*  against the law, but he did it. And he found out it was against the law and he couldn't do it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  They've always been worried about, is this against the law and can I do it? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1098.4s)]
*  There's also this really interesting section, Rachel, where it's not just the history of the [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1102.48s)]
*  presidency, but they also do this analogizing to other positions. And there's a few different [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1106.16s)]
*  examples, right? Juries, right? Like jurors, we need them to make tough calls and use their [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1110.48s)]
*  discretion. But like their stuff that they could do that would be criminal in their official duty, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1115.28s)]
*  like if someone paid them to vote a certain way, that would be criminal. Judges, judges have to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1120.24s)]
*  make a ton of tough calls. You know that judges, justices were writing for, but also judges can be [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1124.56s)]
*  prosecuted and it all seems to work out. Like members of Congress have to make tough discretionary [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1130.0s)]
*  calls about what's legal, what's not, like also can be prosecuted. They sort of go through all [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1135.04s)]
*  these other examples, like, yeah, there's all these people that have to do difficult stuff, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1139.36s)]
*  make tough calls about what the law is, and none of them are rendered immune. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1142.8s)]
*  Right. And there's, I mean, they go back to cases from the 30s. They go through all of [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1148.96s)]
*  those different examples. They go through all these different presidential examples that we just talked [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1153.52s)]
*  about, including, I mean, again, most famously, why did Ford need to pardon Nixon? I mean, it says [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1157.68s)]
*  in the proclamation, as a result of certain acts or omissions occurring before his resignation from [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1165.84s)]
*  the office of president, Richard Nixon has become liable to possible indictment and trial [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1170.8s)]
*  for offenses against the United States. Right? Like it wasn't something we had to like read into [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1176.24s)]
*  their state of mind. Like it's explicit in the proclamation. Everybody knows that after a [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  president leaves office, he or she can be indicted. And that has always been baked in to what presidents [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1185.68s)]
*  have done. So this idea that it'll be a new thing and it will make all presidents afraid and timid, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1192.32s)]
*  they both disprove it in the law and they disprove it historically, and they disprove it in a way [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1197.84s)]
*  that just makes sense to the average American who isn't a lawyer, who's trying to understand [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1202.9599999999998s)]
*  what's happening with this very radical thing going on in Republican party politics, trying to [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1207.12s)]
*  put this guy on the ballot again. Yeah. And to that point about public audience, judicial audience, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1212.08s)]
*  right? Cause there are two throughout all of this and there's two, there's, you know, they're very [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1217.12s)]
*  frank about sort of different sort of interests at play, right? Presidential interest to act with [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1220.32s)]
*  some latitude in a difficult job, the public interest in making sure that people don't try [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1225.52s)]
*  to like overturn elections and foment violent coups on the Capitol, which they talk about. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1229.44s)]
*  Now we've got this question about the public interest of this thing getting to trial. So [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1234.32s)]
*  here's the timing. They say the clerk, meaning the court clerk, is directed to withhold issuance of [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1239.12s)]
*  the mandate. That's basically the sort of possession of the case back to Judge Tony [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1243.6s)]
*  Chetkin through February 12th, 2024. And then within that period, the appellant notifies the [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1247.44s)]
*  clerk in writing. He's filed an application to the Supreme court. The clerk is directed to withhold [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1252.88s)]
*  issuance of the mandate pending the Supreme court's final disposition of the application, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1256.64s)]
*  which means it now goes to the court, which has a monumental decision both on the merits, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1260.0s)]
*  but also on the timing. Yeah. The Supreme court is, is faced with a strange one here. There, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1265.0400000000002s)]
*  if this was any other litigant, they wouldn't take it. It just, it's a preposterous claim. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1270.88s)]
*  An appeals court is dealing effectively with a completely preposterous claim. And so the only [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1276.16s)]
*  reason to take it is, well, it's presidential, so maybe we should weigh in. But they have to know [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1280.32s)]
*  that they're going to have SEAL Team Six in the hearing, in the Supreme court. It's not going to [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1286.1599999999999s)]
*  be one question about SEAL Team Six. You know, there are going to be several judges who have an [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1291.76s)]
*  opportunity to question about Donald Trump's ability to have as many Supreme court justices [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1296.48s)]
*  as he wants executed so that he can get the opinions he wants out of the Supreme court. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1303.36s)]
*  And he cannot be prosecuted for that if he also executes enough United States senators so that he [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1309.6s)]
*  cannot be found guilty in an impeachment trial. Yeah. And so there's a circus. The Supreme court [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1316.48s)]
*  knows, oh my God, there's a horrible, stupid circus coming our way. All we have to do is deny cert. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1322.08s)]
*  Well, and it contrasts a little bit with the position of the case, its posture, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1330.32s)]
*  Rachel, going forward, right? Because the case they're going to hear here on Thursday, they had [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1335.68s)]
*  to take, basically. I think we would all sort of all agree, right? Like, you know, Colorado kicked [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1340.16s)]
*  the guy off the ballot. So did Maine. Other states aren't. There's got to be some of the highest [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  court in the land is going to be the one that's ultimately going to give us a constitutional [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1350.88s)]
*  ruling on this. They had to get involved in this one, to Lawrence's point. They simply don't. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. And the mechanics of how that happens, though, end up being important. I mean, you only [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1360.48s)]
*  need four Supreme court justices to say, yes, we want to hear it, which means you need that. I mean, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1365.28s)]
*  you don't you don't need a majority. You only need four. It's easy to imagine then them coming [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1371.84s)]
*  up with the four, even if it is impossible to imagine them deciding on the merits in Trump's [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1376.48s)]
*  favor. And so do they want to take the case? They don't have to agree to have a incredibly radical, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1382.08s)]
*  stupid ruling in order to do Donald Trump a big favor here. They just have to agree to hear it. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1389.44s)]
*  And then go slow and, you know, hope that Trump gets elected, in which case all these cases go [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1394.8s)]
*  away. And that's that seems to me. I mean, that's I don't know what we should expect from this [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1400.1599999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court. It's amazing. They're going to get the the disqualification issue on Thursday and the [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1405.76s)]
*  immunity issue on Monday. I don't know what to expect for them. But certainly, if they want to [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1410.96s)]
*  help Trump here, they have lots of ways to do it. Yeah. And we should also say that this is this [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1415.84s)]
*  court's posture has been an incredibly imperious and greedy one about what they get to say on what [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1420.88s)]
*  issues of public life they get to say. They have been sort of sticking their noses in all kinds of [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1430.48s)]
*  places. They've been telling executive agencies that they've that they're you know, that they get [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1436.72s)]
*  to say they've been telling Congress that it delegated things called major questions, even [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1441.92s)]
*  though there's no sort of constitutional doctrine, they've invented it. So they seem to be a court, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1446.32s)]
*  at least the sort of conservative majority that is very much a court. It's like we're going to say. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think that kind of sense of sort of their own kind of grandeur and importance. It's very [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1456.56s)]
*  hard for me to see them. To your point, Lawrence, I think they don't want the mess, but they also [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1463.2s)]
*  want to be the like, we're the ones who say and they're the most they're the most unpredictable [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1467.84s)]
*  Supreme Court of our lifetimes. Yes, I mean, particularly, particularly on the question of [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1472.56s)]
*  precedent, which is what this entire opinion rests solely on, which is also sort of somewhat [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1480.24s)]
*  worrying Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O'Donnell. What a pleasure to have you both off the top here. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1485.2s)]
*  Let's do this all the time. You bet. Thank you very much. Really appreciate it. This is awesome. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1488.3999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. Thank you. All right. We're going to be together again for a primetime special on [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1491.84s)]
*  the other gigantic court case Trump is facing. You can see not just me, Lawrence and Rachel, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1497.44s)]
*  but of course, our good friends, Alex Wagner, Joy Reid, Ari Melber, Stephanie Ruhl. We go all together [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1503.3600000000001s)]
*  as Trump stares down what could be as big a court loss to date. Our expert legal team is here to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1507.92s)]
*  break all that down next. So earlier today, DC Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that Donald [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1512.96s)]
*  Trump is not immune from criminal prosecution for his attempt to steal the 2020 election. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1520.4s)]
*  The 57 page opinion by three judges, two appointed by President Joe Biden, one [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1525.2s)]
*  by President George H.W. Bush is so thorough and painstaking, it doesn't leave a ton of wiggle room [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  or outstanding legal questions. But there are new questions about what this all means and crucially, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1534.48s)]
*  what might happen next at what pace? Here to work through all that, Harry Littman, former U.S. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1539.44s)]
*  Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1544.32s)]
*  Department of Justice. Joyce Vance is a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1547.8400000000001s)]
*  Katie Fang served as a prosecutor in the state attorney's office in Florida's Miami-Dade County [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1552.32s)]
*  is of course now the host of the Katie Fang Show, which airs Saturdays at noon here on MSNBC. And [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1557.12s)]
*  Lisa Rubin here at the table, former litigator, now an MSNBC legal analyst. All right. So I've [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1561.6s)]
*  got this sort of power team here and I'm going to basically say, we'll stipulate on the merits of [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1566.32s)]
*  this opinion, which is thorough and good and basically gets it right. I think we sort of all [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1573.9199999999998s)]
*  agree. I think we all thought that going in the big question is these procedural questions going [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1578.0s)]
*  forward. How so let me start with you, Lisa, at the table here about what does specifically the court, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1583.76s)]
*  D.C. court hand the Supreme Court in terms of this, like you have to February 12th and then what? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1593.28s)]
*  So the question about what he has until February 12th to do, I think is a little bit poorly [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1599.28s)]
*  understood right now. He needs to file a motion for a stay pending his petition for cert, which [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1605.52s)]
*  is a petition for Supreme Court review. But that petition for a stay requires five votes, not the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1612.16s)]
*  four votes required to review the case. So the whole kit in caboodle here, as it were, is those [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1620.56s)]
*  five votes. If he doesn't have that, four justices can say, let's review the case. But if there is no [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1627.44s)]
*  stay, then the D.C. Circuit issues the mandate, which is a fancy way of saying it kicks it back [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1633.76s)]
*  down to Judge Chetkin for pretrial proceedings. Right. So absence of stay, Harry, the procedural [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1639.04s)]
*  posture is you could imagine a sort of parallel track. So Tanya Chetkin has the mandate back, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1644.8s)]
*  which means the football, she's got the football in her hands, right? She has possession of the [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1649.44s)]
*  case and its control. Maybe there's some cert process happening, you know, across the street [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1654.08s)]
*  from the U.S. Capitol. But for the timing purposes, that doesn't matter. The big question is [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1661.68s)]
*  if he gets a stay, then what? One hundred percent. So first case I ever worked on as a clerk up there, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  there were four votes to grant, but it was a death penalty case. They couldn't get the fifth for a [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1675.04s)]
*  stay and he was executed. So the rule of five versus rule of four matters here. But I think [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1678.96s)]
*  given this case and the topic, I don't think only four will vote. Let's say five vote first. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1684.6399999999999s)]
*  Say the first thing that will happen is it'll be presented to Chief Justice Roberts, who's the [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1690.96s)]
*  circuit judge for the D.C. Circuit. He'll refer it to the court and they'll decide whether to grant [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1695.04s)]
*  it. They might in this case, it's unusual, treat Trump's motion for a stay as a petition for cert, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1701.2s)]
*  especially since Jack Smith has already moved forward. So they could even move more quickly. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1708.6399999999999s)]
*  One thing is certain. If they take the case, it will be an expedited schedule. Nevertheless, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1713.6s)]
*  it means that they'll have the case till around June. And that translates into trial back in [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1719.12s)]
*  Judge Chuckins around September in the very heat of the election, which will give rise to other [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1725.52s)]
*  legal challenges if they deny. And if you put a gun to my head, my best guess is they will deny. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1731.6s)]
*  Then it's back with Judge Chuckin by June or so. OK, Joyce, do you think they're going to deny? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1737.84s)]
*  You know, I think it's a tough call, Chris. I can find an awful lot of ways to get to four [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1747.28s)]
*  on this court for a lot of different reasons. And I think the best we can do is say that sometimes [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1752.64s)]
*  our crystal balls are faulty and we have to wait and see what happens. One of the problems, though, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1758.0s)]
*  and I think Harry gets precisely at this, is that if the court does hear it, let's say even [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1763.6s)]
*  that the liberal wing of the court feels like this is an issue that the courts have never decided [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1769.36s)]
*  before. It's important to have their stamp on this issue about presidential immunity. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1774.24s)]
*  An opinion could be delayed if their dissents and the dissenters could take their time. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1779.9199999999998s)]
*  On the other hand, if the court is single minded in its purpose here, it's possible that they could [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1785.36s)]
*  expedite and turn out a quick decision. They did it in Bush v. Gore, the election contest in [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1790.72s)]
*  Florida. They did it in Watergate. Ultimately, this is up to the whims of the justices. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1797.2s)]
*  Right. And, Katie, the justices here being nine individuals and the whims, meaning counting to [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1803.28s)]
*  five of those four, but then also the question of the degree to which people who are not in the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1810.56s)]
*  majority can delay. That's sort of the question too to me is if you get the case and you schedule [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1815.12s)]
*  expedited arguments, again, it's all the clock at this point. And then there's no, I mean, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1822.1599999999999s)]
*  my wife clerked at the court and I know people that haven't been around the court a bit. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1828.32s)]
*  Basically, the clock is ticking for the what? The last day in June that they release arguments [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1833.84s)]
*  is basically the one deadline and the big cases are always on the last day. Maybe they go into [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1838.6399999999999s)]
*  July once in a while. I don't know if they ever have, but that's about it. You go into July 1st [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1843.52s)]
*  and then to Harry's point, if your job is to delay and you want to delay, you just want to delay for [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1847.84s)]
*  whatever reason, you can probably get this to the end of June, right? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1854.8s)]
*  Yeah. So it's pretty convoluted and you and I and the rest of this panel could spend [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1862.08s)]
*  hours talking about the different iterations of how this could play out. But the reason why I [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1866.8s)]
*  think that SCOTUS is going to take it, Chris, is even the circuit court in its opinion noted [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1871.76s)]
*  that this is an issue of first impression and any Supreme Court is going to want to take an issue of [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1877.12s)]
*  first impression, put its imprimatur on it and make sure that it's the final word, especially to be [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  able to put to bed and to rest any other defenses raised by Donald Trump and other jurisdictions [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1888.08s)]
*  as the presidential immunity. So in this instance, it's, I think that they're going to take it. Now, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1893.44s)]
*  all of that being said, to Joyce's point, there is a way by which this can be addressed more quickly [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1899.12s)]
*  than waiting to get something by the end of June. And frankly, we as members of a judiciary or the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  members of America that have a judiciary, they're not bound by the idea that because there's a [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1911.12s)]
*  presidential election in November, that that necessarily means that you cannot continue, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1916.08s)]
*  begin a trial and continue it, Chris. You can start it and have it go. And not to mention the [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1922.24s)]
*  fact that Trump has other cases, right? So this is not the end all be all when it comes to a trial [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1927.12s)]
*  calendar for Donald Trump. I mean, my own feeling just this is me talking as a citizen, basically, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1931.36s)]
*  you know, about a country I love, which is basically that there's an enormous, it's just [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1936.9599999999998s)]
*  this obvious, enormously important matter of public import in both directions. I keep saying this, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1943.12s)]
*  but I don't mean it disingenuously. It's not like we, you know, this has to happen so you can get [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1948.9599999999998s)]
*  Trump. If the man is innocent of the crimes that he has been accused of, voters are entitled to [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1953.44s)]
*  that knowledge. They're entitled to no other direction, obviously, before entrusting him to [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1959.1200000000001s)]
*  take office again, particularly if he's not knocked off the ballot under the arguments are going to [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1964.0800000000002s)]
*  happen on Thursday. And so my, I mean, again, my feeling, I guess Lisa is like, we start to get into [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1968.0800000000002s)]
*  dangerous timing territory if the court grants her like it to me becomes a genuine open question. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1976.4s)]
*  Does the trial happen for election day? I think it is a genuine open question. And though I'd like [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1983.52s)]
*  to believe, as Harry said earlier, that if the court grants cert, it will do so on an expedited [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1988.96s)]
*  basis. There's the possibility that it doesn't do so that it pulls what I would call like a [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1993.8400000000001s)]
*  Dobbs maneuver, right? Where they agree to hear the case, but because of concerns about election [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=1998.48s)]
*  interference, they hold off on even agreeing to hear the case for some period of months, don't [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2003.76s)]
*  even hear it until the next term. That's what I call the Gerstein scenario. That would be [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2009.3600000000001s)]
*  so outrageous. It would be cynical and such a violation of their democratic commitment. Like, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2013.28s)]
*  I can't believe that agreed to hear the Dobbs case and didn't tell anybody. And on the public [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2020.96s)]
*  docket said they were still considering it. So yes, I'm being cynical right now, but this is [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2025.52s)]
*  the court that gives me cause to be cynical. Very quickly. That's the worst case scenario. I think [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2029.6000000000001s)]
*  Harry, your gut says they find a way not to grant cert and they don't grant the stay. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2034.4s)]
*  Right. Well, that would be the same thing, but a very important point. You're right. The hubris [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2039.92s)]
*  of them says they'd want to take it, but they, their desire not to be responsible for the election [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2045.92s)]
*  is very strong, even in their own selfish interests on the other side. So you have to [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2051.84s)]
*  weigh both of those, even if you have a craven view of the Supreme court. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2056.0s)]
*  All right. Harry Lippman, Joyce fans, Katie Fang and Lisa Rubin. What a great group. Thank you all. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2059.92s)]
*  Really appreciate it. Silicon Congressman Adam Schiff joins me on what the DC court ruling [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2064.48s)]
*  means for the health of our democracy. Plus what comes next after today's spectacular Republican [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2069.6s)]
*  failure in the house next. It has been almost 150 years since the house impeached a cabinet member. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2075.2s)]
*  It's only happened once. And that was for a sprawling reconstruction era kickback scheme [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2086.0s)]
*  that there were dozens of witnesses who could testify to the details of tonight. House [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2090.96s)]
*  Republicans tried to do it for only the second time in American history and just failed, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2096.16s)]
*  fell on their faces spectacularly, stunningly. They called a vote to impeach secretary of homeland [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2101.52s)]
*  security, Alejandro Mayorkas, again, for nothing in particular other than their objections to his [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2108.08s)]
*  policy and the Biden policies on the border. It was a complete political stunt in election year. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2113.3599999999997s)]
*  And still somehow the Republican majority screwed up their own whip count. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2118.48s)]
*  On this vote, the yeas are 214 and the nays are 216. The resolution is not adopted. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2123.36s)]
*  Congressman Adam Schiff of California was the lead manager for the first impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2134.6400000000003s)]
*  He served on the January 6th committee. He's also a candidate for Senate in 2024 and he joins me now. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2138.4s)]
*  Congressman, I think when I covered Congress between I think 2007 and 2011, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2145.28s)]
*  there was one bill that failed on the House that the majority won. That was TARP, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2151.36s)]
*  which huge deal, right? Post bailout, you probably remember it was a big deal when it failed. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2155.6800000000003s)]
*  I feel like they do this like every few months now. I just don't understand what they're doing. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2160.8s)]
*  How did this happen today? It is really baffling. The number one rule, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2167.6800000000003s)]
*  the big speaker is know how to count, know how to count. And the fact they would bring this up, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2174.0s)]
*  something as potentially consequential as an impeachment of a cabinet official [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2180.4s)]
*  and not have counted their votes is really inexplicable. But then the whole conduct of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2184.48s)]
*  their impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden, against Secretary Mayorkas, it's basically been [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2190.1600000000003s)]
*  impeachment proceedings in search of a subject. They wanted to impeach Biden, but they couldn't [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2196.7200000000003s)]
*  come up with any evidence. You know, the highly publicized image of Chairman Comer, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2201.6800000000003s)]
*  Republican chairman with his hand over his head with basically a face plant is a great metaphor [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2208.3999999999996s)]
*  for their entire conduct of this Congress and in particular impeachment proceedings. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2214.24s)]
*  But having failed to come up with anything on Joe Biden, they said, well, who else can we impeach? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2218.64s)]
*  And they settled on Ali Mayorkas. And even they couldn't do that. Next week, I think we're going [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2223.6s)]
*  to impeach a ham sandwich. And who knows where this is going to end. It does look like there's [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2228.08s)]
*  some notion that Steve Scalise, who is missing today, I think for medical procedures, will be [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2234.16s)]
*  returned tomorrow. I think they're going to take this vote again. I think they probably will [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2238.24s)]
*  have the votes tomorrow, although never know with Republican House leadership. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2243.04s)]
*  What's the consequence here? I mean, this is not this does not happen. It's been 150 years [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  since this happened. And the last guy, William Belknap, was caught basically red handed, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2256.3999999999996s)]
*  like clearly committing high crimes and misdemeanors. What does it mean for the country [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2260.24s)]
*  for them to do this if they can pull it off tomorrow? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2264.64s)]
*  It's another norm broken. It's another abuse of congressional process, which ought to be the most [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2269.04s)]
*  serious process. And that is to remove someone from office through impeachment. So essentially, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2275.2s)]
*  they're going to turn this into yet another political tool. As I said on the House floor, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2281.6s)]
*  hey, when you find evidence that a cabinet official or the president has withheld money [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2286.08s)]
*  from an ally at war to extort them to help you cheat an election or led an insurrection [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2291.2799999999997s)]
*  against our government, then impeach them. But until you do stop wasting everybody's time. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2296.56s)]
*  And, you know, I think what they will do and are doing is lowering the bar, essentially the way [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2302.3199999999997s)]
*  they have with censure, the way they have with expulsion and other things to basically say, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2308.72s)]
*  we're going to use these political tools whenever we find it useful. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2314.64s)]
*  And that is just damaging to the institution. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2318.64s)]
*  You know, the president, who, as you know, lost his case before the DC's Court of Appeals today [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2322.08s)]
*  about immunity, he has this to say, and I think it relates actually to impeachment, right, which is [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2328.4s)]
*  to use these processes as explicit partisan weapons and to complain about them being used [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2333.2s)]
*  as explicit partisan weapons so that you can do the same, right, so that you can create that [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2340.8s)]
*  as a sort of baseline of normal behavior. He says if immunity is not granted to a president, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2345.2000000000003s)]
*  every president leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2349.44s)]
*  Without complete immunity, a president United States would not be able to properly function, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2353.04s)]
*  which, as I said earlier in the program, that reads to me like a threat, basically. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2356.5600000000004s)]
*  How does it sound to you? It does sound like a threat. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2360.0800000000004s)]
*  And here's the thing about today. And I think the significance of this ruling, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  first, it shouldn't be a hard decision. It really wasn't a hard decision for the Court of Appeals. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2369.2s)]
*  You know, as they pointed out in their opinion, the ultimate check on a presidency is being able [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2374.64s)]
*  to vote them out of office. And if you could commit crimes to prevent being thrown out of office, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  then there is no check left in the Constitution. This was not a hard decision, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2385.12s)]
*  even for the Republican-appointed Court of Appeals judge in this case. It should not, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2389.8399999999997s)]
*  and I think will not be a hard decision for the Supreme Court. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2396.24s)]
*  But the rub is the one you discussed earlier, and that is, do they delay so that this gets [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2399.3599999999997s)]
*  pushed into next year when Trump could, if he were successful in the election, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2406.64s)]
*  make the whole thing go away? Or do they do their duty and deny cert or take it up and move quickly? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2411.04s)]
*  I have confidence that even this terrible reactionary court on the merits is not going [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2418.0s)]
*  to say the president is above the law, but I'm less confident that they will act with any kind [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2423.92s)]
*  of alacrity. It may be their subterfuge to essentially draw this out and once again, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2429.52s)]
*  let Donald Trump deny justice by delaying justice. Congressman Adam Schiff, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2437.44s)]
*  Democratic California, thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2442.4s)]
*  David Plouffe was a campaign manager for President Obama's 2008 presidential run, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2447.28s)]
*  then served as senior advisor to the president. He joins me now. How are you? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2451.84s)]
*  Chris, good to see you. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2455.76s)]
*  So, you know, there's a few things that I feel like I have a good read on the politics of, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2456.8s)]
*  like abortion rights right now. Like, it's pretty clear. It just shows up, election after left, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2461.76s)]
*  day after day. I also think the polling has shown American voters are not going to be psyched to [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2466.1600000000003s)]
*  vote for a man as a major party nominee for president if he is convicted of federal crimes [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2472.4s)]
*  in an election year. That seems pretty clear as well. But everything short of that, I don't know. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2477.52s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2484.48s)]
*  Well, today it's just a cluster. And so I think, you know, to make the Republicans and Trump [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2486.48s)]
*  pay full political price for that come next fall, you know, you're going to have to build [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2493.6s)]
*  a campaign around this, which is if you elect these people, they'll be incompetent. More than that, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2497.36s)]
*  Trump's just going to be focused on the dictonists, settling scores. Won't do anything to help your [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2501.52s)]
*  bottom line, your paycheck, your health care. So even with the border deal, I thought Biden's [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2505.84s)]
*  speech was strong today. But, you know, that's not even like the first batter in the first [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2510.8s)]
*  inning. You've got to stay at it because most people going to decide this election are paying [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2514.7200000000003s)]
*  zero attention to what happens in Washington. So you've got to feed it to them and feed it to them [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2518.08s)]
*  and feed it to them. But at the end of the day, I think that now Trump's got a huge lead over [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2521.84s)]
*  Biden on the border. So I don't think we can expect Biden to get that even. But if you can [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2526.32s)]
*  make some progress on it and people look like Trump is just completely full of it, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2531.28s)]
*  I think there's some potential political benefit there. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2535.76s)]
*  Okay. So there's a border deal that was negotiated for four months, bipartisan group of senators. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2538.5600000000004s)]
*  Trump comes out, kills it, and it's endorsed by a bunch of conservatives. The Border Patrol [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2545.6000000000004s)]
*  Union comes out for it. All Street Journal today. Editorial board. I guess my question is, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2552.6400000000003s)]
*  so there's two ways to think about this with my Yorks. Like they clearly, the way you generally [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2558.0s)]
*  think about this is issue salience, right? You want to raise issue salience on issues you have [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2562.08s)]
*  an advantage of, right? You want people talking about the border, not abortion, if you're Republicans. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2566.4s)]
*  So the question then becomes at the Democratic side is like, how do you deal with that? You know, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2571.76s)]
*  they're impeaching my orcas to raise a salience. Can you jiu-jitsu this somehow so that you're not [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2576.16s)]
*  just basically raising the salience of an issue you're losing? Well, I think you can. And listen, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2584.8s)]
*  having been through campaigns, you've got a set of issues, maybe character where you've got an [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2589.92s)]
*  advantage, but you're not on offense. You don't have the ball all the time. So you've got to play [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2594.8s)]
*  defense too. So I think immigration is a very salient issue with voters and not just on the [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2598.88s)]
*  hard right. So I think Biden now and Democrats generally have the ability to say, listen, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2603.6800000000003s)]
*  this has been a big problem for a long time. Trump actually made it worse. We actually had a bunch of [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2608.0800000000004s)]
*  solutions that would have given us a chance. And because he said he didn't want to help Biden. And [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2612.8s)]
*  by the way, that's what he'll do when he's president. He's not going to be focused on solving a single [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2616.48s)]
*  problem for anyone in this country, but creating problems for political enemies. So I think that's [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2619.76s)]
*  a way potentially where it also gives Biden and Democrats an answer. Every time they're asked by [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2623.84s)]
*  a reporter or a voter about the border, they can say, we had a set of solutions, by the way, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2628.96s)]
*  with a lot of Republicans on board and Trump killed it. Right. What do you think about the [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2633.44s)]
*  sort of unpredictability into the political calendar of the possibility of these trials? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2639.68s)]
*  No one's ever dealt with this, but I don't know if he goes on trial in September. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2647.2s)]
*  I don't know. My gut says, don't overthink it, Chris. It's not good for him. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2651.68s)]
*  But then I don't know. Sometimes I read the polling or I'm just like, wow, man, I don't know. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2658.8799999999997s)]
*  It's unprecedented. I will say this, and maybe wrong about this, but I think it will help him [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2663.52s)]
*  with turnout. I think it will hurt him with swing voters, if we're talking about a fall. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2667.44s)]
*  And so that's the math that comes into play here. So I think at the end of the day, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2672.0s)]
*  if you're the Biden campaign, you just have to control what you can control. You can't [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2676.32s)]
*  control the timing of this. Do you think short of trial, any of this stuff penetrates or is it the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2680.16s)]
*  job? One of the things, one of the sort of default beliefs of the kind of political class of [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2688.7200000000003s)]
*  democratic consultants is that everyone has already priced in this guy. You got to run on [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2694.88s)]
*  other stuff and let his hisness do its thing. And I'm not quite sold on that. I actually think [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2700.32s)]
*  people have really forgotten who he is, and I think you actually do have to attack on that. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2706.0s)]
*  I'm not sold on that at all. I'll give you an example from 2008. Barack Obama was universally [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2709.76s)]
*  known. What we found in the general election against McCain is if we stopped running biography [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2714.2400000000002s)]
*  in any market, our numbers slipped. You always have to remind people. And so that's a way to [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2718.6400000000003s)]
*  rate example. Yeah, you got to raise the stakes. Because I think at the end of the day, we can talk [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2724.32s)]
*  about abortion and health care and foreign policy, all important. I think this is going to come down [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2728.2400000000002s)]
*  to enough people say, I can't do it again. And with Trump, and that's not going to happen on its own. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2732.56s)]
*  You got to put it in front of people. You got to remember what the first time was like, which [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2738.1600000000003s)]
*  people have blocked out, understandably, because it's unpleasant to think about. David Pluff, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2742.0s)]
*  as always, good pleasure to have you here. Before we go, special programming note about tomorrow [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2746.6400000000003s)]
*  night, I will be back here at 7pm for a special hour previewing what to expect when the Supreme [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2751.28s)]
*  Court hears arguments on whether the insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment means that Trump is [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2757.76s)]
*  ineligible to be on that ballot. That's a special Supreme Court preview at 7pm tomorrow before an [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2762.4s)]
*  hour of regular all in, which I will also be hosting. And then on Thursday, we're gonna have [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2768.6400000000003s)]
*  the oral arguments that morning. That evening, the whole MSMZ primetime gang will be here for a [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2772.96s)]
*  special night of coverage hosted by Rachel Maddow. Be sure to tune in for that too. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2778.48s)]
*  That does it for all in. You can catch us every weeknight at eight o'clock on MSNBC. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2782.56s)]
*  Don't forget to like us on Facebook. That's facebook.com slash all in with Chris. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5NHXhAQsc&t=2786.32s)]
