# Elon Musk wanted to tip off Trump to secret search warrant in Jan. 6 case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8)
*  But first today, in a pair of newly public documents, we've learned brand new details [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=0.0s)]
*  about both Donald Trump and his lawyers' attempts to overturn American democracy and the special [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=4.96s)]
*  counsel's attempt to hold him accountable. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=10.42s)]
*  The first document we learned about is yet another coup memo, dated exactly one month [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=13.34s)]
*  before January 6. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=18.88s)]
*  It is authored by Trump election lawyer Ken Chisbro, believed to be one of the unindicted [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=20.3s)]
*  co-conspirators mentioned in the Jack Smith indictment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=25.42s)]
*  And it expands on the so-called fake-electors scheme and the efforts to pressure Mike Pence [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=28.8s)]
*  to hand the election to Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=33.8s)]
*  I believe that what can be achieved on January 6 is not simply to keep Biden below 270 electoral [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=35.92s)]
*  votes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=43.2s)]
*  It seems feasible. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=44.2s)]
*  The vote count can be conducted so that at no point will Trump be behind in the electoral [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=45.34s)]
*  vote count unless and until Biden can obtain a favorable decision from the Supreme Court. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=52.24s)]
*  In other words, a scheme to declare Trump the winner over the will of the people and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=58.84s)]
*  to force Biden to try to claw back his legitimate small-D democratic victory via the 6-3 Trump [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=62.6s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=70.72s)]
*  So that's one document we got today, but it's not all we learned today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=72.48s)]
*  Because we also got a newly unsealed legal filing from the January 6 case, revealing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=75.92s)]
*  that the special counsel successfully gained access to the ex-president's Twitter account [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=80.72s)]
*  earlier this year, but not without a fight from the company's new right-wing owner, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=86.16s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=89.92s)]
*  Back in May, it was first reported that Smith's team was feuding with a major tech company [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=90.92s)]
*  in some capacity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=95.76s)]
*  The details of the fight were unclear based on the available court records at the time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=97.22s)]
*  So now we know precisely what went down, at least part of it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=101.36s)]
*  As part of his investigation, Smith deemed it necessary to view the inner workings of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=105.58s)]
*  Trump's Twitter account, although it's not currently clear what exactly he was looking [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=110.12s)]
*  for, per the legal filing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=113.84s)]
*  Quote, on January 17, 2023, the government applied for and obtained a search warrant [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  that directed Twitter to produce data and records related to the real Donald Trump Twitter [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  account. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=127.56s)]
*  Based on affidavits, the district court found probable cause to search the Twitter account [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=128.96s)]
*  for evidence of criminal offenses. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  In other words, Smith was able to convince a judge that there was reason to believe Donald [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=134.88s)]
*  Trump's Twitter account contained evidence of crime, probable cause, constitutional standard. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=139.56s)]
*  Now at the time, Twitter was newly in the hands of that gentleman there, you probably [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=143.76s)]
*  know him, Elon Musk, who was very busy building a public image as a right-wing troll. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  And the company was operating in such a state of manifest dysfunction, Smith's prosecutors [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=154.4s)]
*  could not even get through to them initially. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  I quote again, the government faced difficulties when it first attempted to serve Twitter with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=162.76s)]
*  the warrant. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=167.68s)]
*  On January 17, 2023, the government tried to submit the papers through Twitter's website [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=168.88s)]
*  for legal requests, only to find out the website was inoperative. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=173.72s)]
*  Two days later, the government successfully served Twitter through that website. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=177.92s)]
*  Okay, so Smith finally gets through to Twitter on the 19th, the deadline to comply with the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=181.4s)]
*  warrants is the 27th, about a week later. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's see how that went. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=187.84s)]
*  Quote, on January 25, when the government contacted Twitter's counsel to check on the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=188.84s)]
*  status of Twitter's compliance, Twitter's counsel stated that she, quote, had not heard [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=193.12s)]
*  anything about the warrant. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  Two days before the deadline, Twitter's lawyer says she had no idea there was even a warrant [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=201.24s)]
*  from the Department of Justice in the first place. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=206.32s)]
*  At this point, not only was Musk running Twitter in his total state of chaos, according to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=208.32s)]
*  all public accounts we have, it was clear that he would stop at nothing to court controversy [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=212.52s)]
*  and attention for his $44 billion vanity purchase, which was very quickly losing value. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=216.88s)]
*  After all, he was already using the platform to spread misinformation, to platform neo-Nazis [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  and white supremacists, and, as he told CNBC, nothing, nothing could stop him from keeping [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=227.48s)]
*  things as chaotic as possible. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=231.96s)]
*  Do your tweets hurt the company? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=235.24s)]
*  There's a scene in The Princess Bride, great movie, where he confronts the person who killed [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=237.24s)]
*  his father. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=246.84s)]
*  And he says, offer me money. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=247.84s)]
*  Offer me power. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=256.96s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=259.08s)]
*  So you just don't care? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=260.08s)]
*  I'll say what I want to say, and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=262.08s)]
*  OK, that last part is going to be important in just a second. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=268.4s)]
*  So here's the crucial part of this whole ordeal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=270.96s)]
*  The Princess Prosecutors had to take steps to ensure that Musk would not spill the beans [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=273.16s)]
*  about the search warrant. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=277.12s)]
*  Quote, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=278.12s)]
*  and obtained a non-disclosure order which prohibited Twitter from disclosing the existence [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=279.68s)]
*  or contents of the search warrant to any person. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=283.48s)]
*  The district court found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that disclosing the warrant [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=285.72s)]
*  to former President Trump would, quote, seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation by giving [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=290.08s)]
*  him, wait for it, an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of behavior or [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=294.76s)]
*  notify Confederates. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=301.0s)]
*  Put more simply, later in the filing, quote, the whole point of the non-disclosure order [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=302.48s)]
*  was to avoid tipping off the former president about the warrant's existence. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=307.8s)]
*  Now, Musk was apparently not happy he couldn't tell Trump about the search warrant. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=311.44s)]
*  Four days after the initial deadline, he challenged the entire process. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=316.68s)]
*  Four days after the deadline, he challenged. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  OK? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=322.88s)]
*  On the grounds he had a free speech right to spill the beans regarding this ongoing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=323.88s)]
*  criminal investigation of the ex-President of the United States. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=327.08000000000004s)]
*  Quote, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=329.56s)]
*  The driver, the guy who abandoned the platform, former President Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=337.8s)]
*  So, Musk is saying, we're not going to cooperate with your warrant until the court rules on [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=342.24s)]
*  whether or not I can talk about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=346.0s)]
*  And then the court ruled against Musk. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=347.36s)]
*  Moreover, they held Twitter in contempt for again missing the deadline to comply with [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=350.68s)]
*  the warrant, which means in addition to access to Trump's account, the company had to fork [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  over $350,000 in fines. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=359.48s)]
*  If you were shocked and surprised today to learn that Jack Smith got access to Trump's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=363.0s)]
*  Whatever private messages might be contained therein, know you may not be alone. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump claims that he is as well. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  Today, he posted, quote, Just found out that crooked Joe Biden's DOJ secretly attacked [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=373.4s)]
*  my Twitter account. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  They didn't attack it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  They just served a warrant on it, making it a point not to let me know about this major [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  hit on my civil rights. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUl3PlZDxx8&t=383.84s)]
