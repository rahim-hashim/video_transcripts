# Trump’s immunity claim won’t be expedited by the Supreme Court
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A)
*  Good afternoon from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Thank you for joining us for a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=0.0s)]
*  special two-hour 4 p.m. edition of All In. It's a little under an hour [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=3.56s)]
*  ago. The Supreme Court rejected a proposal from Special Counsel Jack Smith [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=9.24s)]
*  to accelerate a decision on Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=13.92s)]
*  his federal election criminal interference case. Now one sentence [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=18.32s)]
*  reply the order from the Supreme Court reads quote the petition for writ of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=22.44s)]
*  certiorari before judgment is denied. In other words we're not gonna speed this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=27.06s)]
*  through. We're not touching it before it goes through the normal appeals process [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=32.58s)]
*  which is the appellate circuit court in DC. That outcome is exactly what Special [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=36.379999999999995s)]
*  Counsel Smith was hoping to avoid because the appeals process could give [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=41.18s)]
*  Donald Trump ample time to further delay this case which is of course supposed to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=45.66s)]
*  go to trial just a few months from now in the first week of March. Trump may now [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  try to delay the start of the trial until the calendar begins to encroach on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=55.4s)]
*  next November's general election at which point if he's the nominee the ex [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=59.16s)]
*  president can then ask the court to put the case on pause until the presidential [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=62.72s)]
*  contest is decided. And of course should Trump win that election the case would [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=66.64s)]
*  go away entirely which is to be clear and what we all understand including the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=70.44s)]
*  people on the Supreme Court exactly what he wants. Although I have to say it is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=75.08s)]
*  still unknown if Trump will be allowed to meaningfully delay this trial and we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=79.48s)]
*  should note while the court granting what's called cert before judgment the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=83.3s)]
*  sort of leapfrogging that Smith wanted to do is historically very very rare [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=86.94s)]
*  under the Robert Supreme Court it's been weirdly common. I mean Robert's Supreme [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=91.66s)]
*  Court has done this 19 times since 2019 alone according to analysis from [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court expert Steve Vladeck who has built a life's work studying this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=102.38s)]
*  exact whole exact procedural wrinkle on everything from affirmative action to a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=106.9s)]
*  whole bunch of COVID restriction cases to student debt relief they just reached [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=111.3s)]
*  in and said no we don't need here from the appellate court we want it now we [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=115.58s)]
*  want it now give it to us but when it comes to the question of whether the man [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=119.42s)]
*  who tried to end American democracy should face trial before voters decide [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  if they want to elect him to finish what he started it appears for now the Magist [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=126.42s)]
*  Supreme Court just doesn't appear to be in much of a rush. Melissa Murray is a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=131.46s)]
*  professor at the New York University School of Law. Harry Lippman is a former [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=135.38s)]
*  deputy assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice Marcus [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=138.74s)]
*  Childress served as an investigator for the January 6th committee and they join [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=141.46s)]
*  me now so it's great to have all three of you I got the news and I first thought [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  was like how should I feel about this so of course I texted Kate but I'll start [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=149.78s)]
*  with you Melissa how should I feel how do you feel? Well I'm a little surprised [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=153.3s)]
*  I mean as you say it's not uncommon for the Roberts court to grant cert before [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=157.94s)]
*  judgment they did so with the affirmative action case last year the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=162.3s)]
*  First Circuit had proceeded and decided the Harvard case but the Fourth Circuit [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=165.46s)]
*  was still waiting to decide the UNC case but they took it up on cert anyway they [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=168.86s)]
*  also did the same thing with Biden versus Nebraska the student loan case [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=173.18s)]
*  and there's a broader historical precedent for this as well. The United [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=176.82s)]
*  States versus Nixon the Supreme Court granted cert before judgment in order to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  determine whether Richard Nixon had to comply with the request to turn over [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  certain tapes because there was a pending criminal trial of the Watergate [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=188.66s)]
*  burglars here the same kind of equities are in balance like it's not simply just [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=192.5s)]
*  a criminal trial that's going on here but the fact of an election and whether [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=197.74s)]
*  or not the American people deserve to know whether someone that they're [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=201.38s)]
*  voting for is able to stand trial on criminal charges so it seems like they're [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=204.86s)]
*  really important issues at stake here but the court kind of slow-walked this a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=209.82s)]
*  little bit. So Harry we know so the normal procedure here is that there's a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=213.82s)]
*  district court judgment by Judge Tanya Chukin who who I thought were very [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=221.34s)]
*  strong and persuasive judgment that says look you know you're not you can't [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=225.54s)]
*  assert presidential immunity for actions that were a criminal and B had nothing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=229.38s)]
*  to do with your official office you were working as a candidate to overthrow the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=233.06s)]
*  Constitutional Republic it wasn't like you were overseeing some rulemaking the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  Department of Labor right so so that's persuasive I think it then gets [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=239.98s)]
*  appealed to the appellate court DC Circuit now they have moved quite quickly [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=243.78s)]
*  so I guess my question to you is Smith wanted to move even faster than that but [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  now it's gonna go through that appeals process so what you're thinking about [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  what this signals for timing here? For timing I think it probably means maybe a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=255.78s)]
*  60 day or so delay but I think you've just cited Chris the pivotal fact [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=262.54s)]
*  because that happened after Smith petition for judgment before for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=269.18s)]
*  Sir Sherari before judgment and by the time it came up to the court there was [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=275.1s)]
*  the prospect that the DC Circuit would be moving very quickly we already know [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=280.5s)]
*  they're going to have oral argument on this January 9th will probably issue a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  decision very quickly thereafter and I think the court it decided this whether [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=290.98s)]
*  or not to do it very quickly I think it's aware of the importance and the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  need for expedition but it said to itself you know we could have a fuller [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=300.7s)]
*  treatment by the DC Circuit in just a few weeks I've written my share of cert [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=307.3s)]
*  memos as a clerk and that's something they really care about having it full [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=312.86s)]
*  from the DC Circuit and you mentioned the MAGA court but this was unanimous [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  without dissents so I think the nine who in general are eager to avoid polarized [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=320.14s)]
*  decisions and black eyes coalesced around the idea let's just wait a few [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=325.94s)]
*  weeks to have the benefit of the DC Circuit opinion and as for the point you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=330.78s)]
*  make about ultimate timing even if it delays things even a couple months we're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=335.26s)]
*  nevertheless not on the threshold of November I think they are very aware [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=340.17999999999995s)]
*  themselves of the calendar witness that they jumped on this when asked and and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=344.17999999999995s)]
*  so there I think the effect is real but not fatal yeah so that's that's an [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=349.86s)]
*  important point just sometimes cert petitions will come with dissents authored [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=356.06s)]
*  by any of the justices who will who can write separately and say look I think [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=360.14s)]
*  we should have taken this case in this in this instance we don't have that we [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=363.5s)]
*  don't know there's no like public like cert votes are not made public and you [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=368.06s)]
*  only need four to grant cert you don't need a majority but so we don't know for [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=372.7s)]
*  sure but we know that there's an absence of anyone saying hey guys we [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=377.34s)]
*  shouldn't we should have taken this now there's an interesting procedural move [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=381.53999999999996s)]
*  Marcus that the Colorado State Supreme Court used which I thought was [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=385.14s)]
*  interesting and Steve Vladeck pointed this out they basically issued he says [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=388.94s)]
*  for those that are worried about Trump slow-walking an appeal to SCOTUS if the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  DC Circuit rules against him on immunity which I think we all anticipate the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=396.58s)]
*  Court of Appeals can preempt that by doing what the Colorado Supreme Court [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  A stay that expires basically a kind of exploding stay right a ticking time bomb [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=404.74s)]
*  a stay that expires unless Trump seeks certiorari within say 14 days so there [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=409.86s)]
*  are some ways the DC Circuit itself Marcus can also attend to the urgency of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=415.86s)]
*  speed here yeah I agree and if anyone's aware of how the Trump team and folks [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=421.46s)]
*  associated in like the slow walk these investigations it's me from the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=426.94s)]
*  committee but I want to point to the I want to point to the 11th circuit I mean [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=429.5s)]
*  if we look at that as kind of an indication of how fast these circuit of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=434.3s)]
*  court opinions can occur you have to look no further than Mark Meadows just a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=438.14s)]
*  few weeks ago right he it's a different issue was a removal issue but the court [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=440.94s)]
*  heard argument on December 15th I believe him within like December 18th we [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=444.62s)]
*  had an opinion and so that's just two or three days and so I think it is smart by [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=448.18s)]
*  the prosecutors and the special counsel here to seek expedited review at the DC [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=452.14s)]
*  Circuit while also seeking review at the Supreme Court thinking that this might [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=456.66s)]
*  be a real possibility the Supreme Court wouldn't grant cert here and so now we [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=460.86s)]
*  have a situation where argument we heard on January 9th and as we the co-panelist [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=464.3s)]
*  just said right that doesn't push back the trial date too far I mean let's say [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=468.78000000000003s)]
*  we push it back 90 days it was just suggested a May trial date is still in a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=472.70000000000005s)]
*  good spot for the special counsel's office yeah and I mean again all of this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=476.86s)]
*  sort of circles Melissa this weird combination of the sort of bizarre kind [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=482.38s)]
*  of real politique of a kind of would-be authoritarian who wants to get office [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=488.14s)]
*  so he can stay out of jail and dismiss the cases against him and wants to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=492.7s)]
*  forestall any judgment before a jury of his peers and the rules of federal [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=496.3s)]
*  procedure basically and then that sort of the cherry on top is the rules of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=502.82s)]
*  federal procedure kind of are what they are until the court decides they want to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=506.86s)]
*  move things like this is what's so interesting to me when you go back and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=512.14s)]
*  you look at these cert grants before judgment there's all these COVID cases [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=514.9s)]
*  there's that period of time where the Supreme Court was just like every COVID [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=519.7s)]
*  you know every every local COVID restriction they were just like hoovering [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=523.38s)]
*  up to the court time and time again they wanted they could not wait to get in [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=529.38s)]
*  there to tell basically local governments they couldn't shut things [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=533.7s)]
*  down for COVID yeah I agree a really great point I do want to push back a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=537.58s)]
*  little bit I know Harry has made clear that you know this might result in maybe [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=543.58s)]
*  a 60 or 90 day delay but a delay is a delay and there wasn't that much cushion [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=547.5400000000001s)]
*  in this trial date to begin with I mean the November election is coming there [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=552.98s)]
*  are going to be delays inevitably because this is someone who is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=557.62s)]
*  determined to delay this and whether it's because he's on the campaign trial [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=560.7800000000001s)]
*  or he's got a convention or whatnot there will be other delays so this is a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=564.3s)]
*  tactical victory for Donald Trump even if it's not necessarily an irrational [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=568.5s)]
*  decision by the Supreme Court but Chris you make an excellent point where this [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=574.22s)]
*  court saw an opportunity to move jurisprudence in a particular direction on [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=578.3s)]
*  a range of issues of incredible salience to the American public they did not [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=583.3s)]
*  flinch at the prospect of granting cert before judgment and we saw it time and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=587.62s)]
*  time again they were not interested in a fulsome exposition of the issues in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=592.74s)]
*  the lower federal courts they reached in and they grabbed them and they decided [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=597.54s)]
*  them and they could have done that here too and I agree this will be more fully [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=601.3s)]
*  briefed after going through the DC circuit the DC circuit is going to do [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=605.94s)]
*  this with considerable expedition but it is still a delay and that makes it a [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=608.86s)]
*  victory well yeah and that Harry is the that's what's so strange about this and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=612.74s)]
*  I think there's a sort I think you're both right right like it's a delay [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=616.98s)]
*  there's also enough time there's cushion built in but it's it's the first delay [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=619.86s)]
*  and what what's so bizarre and surreal about this setting Harry said it is it [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=623.82s)]
*  is zero sum in that like literally the number of minutes are a finite amount [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=627.42s)]
*  and they're on the board and the job of Trump's lawyers is just to eat as many [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=632.02s)]
*  of those so every day that they wake up and they gobble some of those minutes [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=637.38s)]
*  off the board and days off the board like that's a win and they're gonna have [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=641.38s)]
*  a whole bunch of bites at it right there's gonna be a whole bunch of ways [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=644.86s)]
*  between now and that first day of an actual trial and then a verdict that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=649.18s)]
*  they are gonna keep taking those bites all true except maybe the last point [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=653.9799999999999s)]
*  yeah it's absolutely right since Chutkin has held she was urged by Smith to say [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=659.7399999999999s)]
*  let's go forward with the pretrial stuff just hold the trial she said no I don't [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=664.66s)]
*  have jurisdiction so a day here equals a day of delay I agree and I agree with [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  Melissa it's not insubstantial delay but this was always remember Chris from the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=673.78s)]
*  time this motion dropped we saw this as his big opportunity for delay because it [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=679.6999999999999s)]
*  gave him the automatic stay so he'll try other strategists for sure but there's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=685.8199999999999s)]
*  reason to believe that Chutkin and the DC Circuit if it comes to it are pretty [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=690.8199999999999s)]
*  much on to them so I see this as his big shot for delay I don't know about those [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=695.14s)]
*  other bites at the apple he'll try them but I don't think she'll receive them [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=700.02s)]
*  very well [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYzpEk1ad5A&t=704.14s)]
