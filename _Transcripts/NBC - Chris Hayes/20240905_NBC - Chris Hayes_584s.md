# Gov. Josh Shapiro on who will win Pennsylvania in November
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM)
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=0.0s)]
*  I've looked at some of the polling in your state. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=2.52s)]
*  You're a very popular governor, and you're a Democratic governor in a state that is a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=4.0s)]
*  pretty closely politically divided state. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  So here's the first question for you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=10.68s)]
*  Someone says, look, I like Governor Josh Shapiro. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=12.56s)]
*  Maybe I'm a Republican, I'm an independent, I'm a sort of centrist. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=15.68s)]
*  But what has the Harris, Biden-Harris administration done, right? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  I think things are pretty good in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=23.56s)]
*  I approve of my governor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=25.28s)]
*  It seems like jobs are doing pretty well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=26.28s)]
*  The economy is doing pretty well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=28.0s)]
*  I chalk it up to a state-level apparatus. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=29.68s)]
*  There's nothing happening down in D.C. other than things screwing us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=32.2s)]
*  What do you say to that kind of voter? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=35.28s)]
*  Look, I would say to the good people of Pennsylvania, yes, we've cut taxes four times here in the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=38.96s)]
*  Commonwealth. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  We've made historic investments in education, in public safety, in economic development. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Things are going well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=50.22s)]
*  We've got a lot more work to do, but things are going well. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=51.22s)]
*  And I understand that politics is a team game here, meaning you've got to have partners [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=53.6s)]
*  in this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=58.98s)]
*  I'm the only governor in the entire country with a divided legislature, one house led [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=59.98s)]
*  by Democrats, one led by Republicans. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=65.02s)]
*  We've managed to get all that done. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=67.89999999999999s)]
*  It's a team sport here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=69.42s)]
*  But it's also a team sport when it comes to having an administration who can work with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=70.74s)]
*  us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=74.62s)]
*  One of the reasons why we're excelling when it comes to energy production is because of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=75.62s)]
*  the strong relationship we have with the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=78.78s)]
*  One of the reasons why we fixed more roads and bridges than ever before is because of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=82.62s)]
*  our partnership with the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=86.82s)]
*  We've got kids who are able to turn the tap on and not drink water with lead in it because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=89.3s)]
*  of the Biden-Harris administration and their commitments to us. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=95.05999999999999s)]
*  We've got folks in rural communities in Pennsylvania who are now getting the high speed internet [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  turned on for the first time because of our partnership with the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=103.66s)]
*  So I would say the good people of Pennsylvania, yes, we've made a lot of strides. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=108.35999999999999s)]
*  I couldn't be more proud to be your governor and enjoy support from Democrats, Republicans [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  and independents. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=116.46s)]
*  But I've had a great partnership with the Biden-Harris administration that's allowed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=117.46s)]
*  me to do so much of this work. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=121.3s)]
*  And let me tell you something, I want that to continue. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=123.22s)]
*  I want Pennsylvania to continue to get its fair share from the federal government, to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=125.78s)]
*  have a president that I can call and lean on when times are tough, when like we did [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=130.26s)]
*  when I-95 collapsed, we had a president who we could call who would be there for us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=135.18s)]
*  I know Kamala Harris can be that president for the entire nation and certainly for the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=139.26s)]
*  good people of Pennsylvania. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=144.22s)]
*  There's a lot of focus on your state. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  I think because of the vagaries electoral college, there's a lot of reason to think [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=147.77999999999997s)]
*  it will be a sort of tipping point state, a kind of must-win state. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=153.05999999999997s)]
*  There's polling that showed today Kamala Harris up by a point. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  It's clear it's very close there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=159.22s)]
*  There's also a lot of nerves about Pennsylvania. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to ask you a question that you can't answer, but people want to hear what [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=163.33999999999997s)]
*  you would say, which is basically like, okay, what's going on there? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=166.61999999999998s)]
*  Like how's it looking? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  Is it close? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=171.89999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any sense of where this is going? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=173.74s)]
*  Who's going to win? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=176.18s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, it seems like maybe the one thing Kamala Harris and Donald Trump agree [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=179.38s)]
*  on is that Pennsylvania is the tipping point state, the deciding state. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=184.34s)]
*  And here's what I'll say. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=188.62s)]
*  I mean, it looks to be basically a dead even race for president. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=190.34s)]
*  And by the way, it also looks to be an even race for the United States Senate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=194.5s)]
*  And I need Bob Casey in the United States Senate. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=197.9s)]
*  He is an outstanding U.S. senator. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=200.62s)]
*  And, you know, head on over to BobCasey.com and chip in two, three, four bucks, whatever [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=203.02s)]
*  you can afford. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=207.22s)]
*  Bob needs our help. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=208.22s)]
*  But when it comes to the presidential race, understand that in Pennsylvania, maybe looking [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=209.22s)]
*  at sort of on a football field, you can maybe get 49 yards up your side of the field. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=214.9s)]
*  But grabbing that extra yard and a half, two yards to get to the other side of the field [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=220.78s)]
*  is really, really tough. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  This is a tough state to compete in and win in. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=227.34s)]
*  The good news is what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are doing is showing up in the communities [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=230.42s)]
*  that need to meet them, the communities that are oftentimes ignored or left behind. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=235.42s)]
*  I mean, right before they went to the DNC in Chicago, they weren't in Philly or Pittsburgh. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  And I love Philly and Pittsburgh, but they went to rural Beaver County. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=244.77999999999997s)]
*  That's in the corner down by Ohio and West Virginia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  I think just yesterday and today, Tim Walz was in rural Lancaster County and up in Erie [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  and rural Fayette County. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=256.34s)]
*  They're showing up in the communities that need to hear from them, need to understand [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=258.1s)]
*  what they're all about, kind of kick the tires and understand more. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=262.70000000000005s)]
*  And I think as Pennsylvanians get more familiar with the vice president and the governor, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=265.3s)]
*  they are going to see them as the people who can help move not just our Commonwealth, but [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=270.02000000000004s)]
*  our entire country forward. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=274.0s)]
*  You spoke at the Democratic National Convention. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=276.02000000000004s)]
*  You had a primetime speaking slot. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=277.98s)]
*  You talked about what's been going on in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=279.58000000000004s)]
*  You talked about also being proud of your faith as a Jewish American, one of the most [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=281.66s)]
*  prominent Jewish politicians in America in the Democratic Party, which features a number [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=285.98s)]
*  of folks, including Chuck Schumer and others. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=290.26s)]
*  I want to just get your reaction to something that Donald Trump says a lot about Jewish [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=292.46s)]
*  Americans, which is that they're crazy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=298.5s)]
*  They need to get their head examined. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=301.14s)]
*  They're essentially betraying who they are if they vote for Democrats, saying if you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=302.82s)]
*  had Democrats to support you or Jewish, you have to have your head examined. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=307.38s)]
*  He warns that Israel will no longer exist if Vice President Kamala Harris becomes president. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=310.86s)]
*  He's used the word Palestinian as a slur against Chuck Schumer to say that he, quote, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=315.18s)]
*  he's almost like a Palestinian. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=319.14s)]
*  I'm curious how that strikes your ears. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=320.46s)]
*  Look, I think it is more of the same from Donald Trump. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=322.46s)]
*  I have been the recipient of many attacks from Donald Trump, including anti-Semitic [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=328.02s)]
*  attacks from Donald Trump over the years, as have the people of Pennsylvania and the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=332.54s)]
*  American people. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=337.14s)]
*  Donald Trump is someone who peddles bigotry and hatred. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=338.94s)]
*  He constantly tries to create others in our society, separate people out based on what [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=342.26000000000005s)]
*  they look like, where they come from, who they love, who they pray to. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=348.26000000000005s)]
*  It is something that is deeply offensive, I think, to many people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=352.74s)]
*  Not just as a governor, but as a father of four, I try and raise our kids to love thy [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  neighbor, to care about their fellow man, their fellow woman. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=362.5s)]
*  We should have a leader of this nation, a leader of the free world, who at least meets [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=367.1s)]
*  those standards that most parents try and hold their children to. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=371.68s)]
*  When you look at what Donald Trump has specifically said to American Jews, this notion of this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=376.16s)]
*  dual loyalty where American Jews can only care about Israel, that is deeply offensive [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=382.36s)]
*  to me and to many others. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=389.04s)]
*  I'm a proud American Jew, and I care about Israel. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=391.4s)]
*  I also care about health care. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=394.56s)]
*  I care about our kids' education. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  I care about our national security. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=397.76s)]
*  I care about a whole host of issues, as many American Jews do, and sort of going with this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=399.76000000000005s)]

*  to have the exact same views on Israel, I think is deeply offensive and deeply troublesome. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump sort of fails that test that parents set for their kids. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=414.68s)]

*  In 2020 here in Pennsylvania, we had a free and fair, safe and secure election, and I [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=476.86s)]
*  am absolutely confident that we will, again, in 2024, have a free and fair, safe and secure [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=482.1s)]

*  that really needs to be nonpartisan. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=508.6s)]
*  Al is leading that way, as are clerks all across Pennsylvania, Republican and Democrat [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=510.82s)]

*  We will again have a free and fair, safe and secure election. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU3-zFZCgcM&t=544.82s)]
