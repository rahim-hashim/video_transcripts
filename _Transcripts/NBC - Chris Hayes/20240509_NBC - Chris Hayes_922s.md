# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 8
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. You know, for all of Donald Trump's attempts to subvert and sabotage the democratic process to steal the last election 2020. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=0.0s)]
*  Overall, the system held. I mean, maybe barely, but it helped. When push came to shove, the vast majority of people involved in the election and institutions stared down a novel attempt to destroy the rule of law and they did the right thing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=9.0s)]
*  System might have bent, but it didn't break. In dozens of cases, for example, more than 60 judges up and down the entire judicial system. I'm talking state to federal court, including judges appointed by Trump and other Republicans ruled that Trump's claims of voter fraud were complete nonsense. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=24.0s)]
*  And individual lawyers and legal officials, Republicans in and out of the White House, stood up against Trump too. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=40.0s)]
*  There is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person would choose the American president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=49.0s)]
*  The president said, suppose I do this, suppose I replace him, Jeff Rosen, with him, Jeff Clark. What do you do? And I said, sir, I would resign immediately. There is no way I'm serving one minute under this guy, Jeff Clark. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=55.0s)]
*  I told him that the stuff that his people were shoveling out to the public was bulls**t. I mean, that the claims of fraud were bulls**t. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=70.0s)]
*  Asterisk on that last one since the attorney general Barr just fled and resigned when the going got tough. But you get the point. And it's an important point. It's important to point out because what we are seeing now, just in the last few weeks, are glimmers of what it looks like when the courts don't hold. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=78.0s)]
*  So yesterday, federal judge Aline Cannon, a Trump appointee who first made a name for herself with an egregious ruling on his behalf in the documents case, she announced that she was indefinitely postponing Donald Trump's criminal trial for stealing top secret government documents. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=98.0s)]
*  And she did so, and this is the important part, without much of a legal justification at all. She is opting not to settle open questions before her, which is her choice. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=114.0s)]
*  I mean, that's her choice. And then pointing out the fact that they are not settled as the reason why she has to further delay. Don't take my word for it. Here's the New York Times in a news article writing it up, put it, quote, while Judge Cannon stated reason for putting off the trial indefinitely was that a large number of legal issues remain up in the air, she never mentioned that she herself helped allow the logjam of motions to pile up. End quote. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=125.0s)]
*  Over and over Judge Cannon has treated seriously arguments that many, if not most federal judges would have rejected out of hand. Often her acceptance of Trump's unorthodox claims have resulted in significant delays in bringing the charges in the classified documents case in front of a jury. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=151.0s)]
*  Because of course, we all know this alien cannon knows it, everyone knows it. What Donald Trump wants most is for this child to be delayed until after the election. And cannon has so far granted him that wish. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=168.0s)]
*  And again, I'm not a lawyer, but I do follow this all quite closely. And a lot of very smart, accomplished attorneys and legal experts, again, with different ideological backgrounds have said they simply never seen anything quite like what Canada is doing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=180.0s)]
*  By so transparently putting her thumb on the proverbial scale to delay and thereby benefit the man who put her on the bench in the first place. As Obama Attorney General Eric Holder said yesterday, quote, and this is really something for him to say, let's just deal with a very disturbing reality here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=194.0s)]
*  This whole process in the documents case has simply not been on the up and up. Some like former George W. Bush, White House lawyer Richard painter have speculated that Judge Cannon holds ambitions for higher office, maybe the Supreme Court. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=213.0s)]
*  Others like former Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb think she is both incompetent and in the tank for the ex president. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=227.0s)]
*  All she's really done today, though, is make official what everybody, including Jack Smith already knew, which was she had no intention of getting this case to trial, and she wasn't competent to get this case to trial. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=235.0s)]
*  The things that she has done here are really inexplicable. And it's tragic. She talks about the public, you know, having honored the public's interest in the administration of justice by postponing the trial. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=247.0s)]
*  You know, she has not honored the public's interest for one day in this case. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=259.0s)]
*  Now this obvious conflict of interest raises an important point. The rule of law, which we talk about a lot on the show and on this network and venerate, is really only as good as the people who are executing it in good faith. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=264.0s)]
*  I mean, to be clear, the world over, there are plenty of autographies from Egypt under Sisi to Russia under Putin that have laws, statutes, lawyers, judiciaries, bar associations, their version of it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=276.0s)]
*  They have all that stuff. They just execute the law in a way that essentially supports a predetermined outcome that is corrupted by the power of certain authorities. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=290.0s)]
*  So take the example of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is currently incarcerated in Russia under bogus espionage charges. He is not a spy. He is just a journalist. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=302.0s)]
*  He has lawyers. He is accused in the Russian system of violating specific laws. They didn't just say, we're kidnapping him, right? His case is ostensibly going through the Russian legal system. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=313.0s)]
*  You see him here at these court dates that he keeps having. But no one seriously believes that this is anything other than trumped up to essentially take an American hostage to trade for someone or believes that he's going to have a fair trial. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=323.0s)]
*  The strategy there, too, is obviously to delay as long as possible to keep this man effectively as a hostage for political reasons. And lo and behold, that's what keeps happening at court date after court date. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=337.0s)]
*  We know what's going to happen. And again, this is, I mean, I can't stress this enough. In many ways, I don't think it's an overstatement to say that is the difference between a free society and authoritarian. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=349.0s)]
*  It's not the presence of judges, laws, and lawyers. Everyone's got those, right? Now, to be clear, we're obviously nowhere near that level of judicial corruption that we're seeing in Russia, right, in this country or what we're seeing from Judge Cannon. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=362.0s)]
*  Or from the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court. These are just totally different worlds. The court is entertaining Trump's ridiculous claims of presidential immunity that he might not be able to, we might be able to count the court as an impartial judiciary anymore. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=377.0s)]
*  So again, these are different worlds. But what we're seeing again in Cannon, the Supreme Court is a glimmer of what it looks like when you just can't really trust that good faith is what's driving the process. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=392.0s)]
*  That's what it is. The problem becomes what to do about it. And the only answer I can come back to, and I've thought about this a lot at the human level, is shame, norms. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=404.0s)]
*  Because in the end, remember, that's what saved us the last time around. I mean, yes, the law helped, right? But again, if the DOJ had bent to Trump's will, if there had been three or four lawyers atop that Department of Justice who were willing to send a letter baselessly claiming there was white power, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=415.0s)]
*  baselessly claiming there was widespread voter fraud, or if Mike Pence had agreed to throw out the electors from swing states, Biden won, if his lawyers had advised him he could do that, I don't know. No one knows what would have happened in the end. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=432.0s)]
*  All we've got are individual people formed by the norms and institutions they're embedded in, making decisions, hopefully coming to the right conclusions and acting in good faith, or at the very least, bowing to some sense of public pressure or shame not to do the wrong thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=445.0s)]
*  So in this case, the least we can do now is state plainly and openly that what Trump appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, is doing is a scandal. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=462.0s)]
*  When our judges don't act in good faith, when they work only to weaponize a judiciary in an effort to achieve a desired outcome, we are in very dangerous territory. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=472.0s)]
*  That's especially true with Donald Trump effectively running to finish the job he started on January 6, a job that can only be completed if the judiciary allows itself to be corrupted. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=481.0s)]
*  And right now, the signs are not promising. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=494.0s)]
*  This afternoon, Georgia Republican Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene made good on her threat to oust Republican Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=499.0s)]
*  The form of the resolution is as follows. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=507.0s)]
*  Declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=511.0s)]
*  This is the Uniparty for the American people watching. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=522.0s)]
*  Gentlelady will suspend. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=528.0s)]
*  Order. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=535.0s)]
*  Order. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=540.0s)]
*  Looks fun banging that gavel, didn't it? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=541.0s)]
*  Things did not get better from there. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=544.0s)]
*  After Greene introduced her motion, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise moved to table the motion, which would effectively kill it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=545.0s)]
*  And within about 40 seconds of the vote opening, it had the support to pass and then some. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=551.0s)]
*  In the end, 163 Democrats, along with 196 Republicans, voted to save Mike Johnson's speakership. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=556.0s)]
*  According to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it was the right thing for his caucus to do. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=563.0s)]
*  Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=568.0s)]
*  We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=586.0s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene and extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=592.0s)]
*  House Democrats are change agents. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=599.0s)]
*  Joining me now, NBC News Senior National Political Reporter Sahil Kapoor, who's been all over Capitol Hill covering the effort to oust Speaker Johnson. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=603.0s)]
*  Sahil, first, just as someone who's been embedded in this story, what did you think of today's outcome? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=611.0s)]
*  Well, Chris, it was a rather extraordinary and somewhat theatrical series of events here. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=618.0s)]
*  The outcome has not been in doubt. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=622.0s)]
*  You know, it's been very clear for a while that Democrats would provide the votes to table this motion, essentially kill Marjorie Taylor Greene's efforts to oust Mike Johnson. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=625.0s)]
*  But it is also the first time in modern history we've seen a speaker of the House have to rely on votes from the minority party to prevent, you know, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=633.0s)]
*  to save his job, to avoid himself getting overthrown. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=640.0s)]
*  So that was notable. And that was ultimately why Marjorie Taylor Greene did this. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=643.0s)]
*  She wanted to make a point that Mike Johnson cannot survive in that job without the support of Democrats. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=647.0s)]
*  Now, technically, this wasn't a vote to overthrow. This is a vote to table a vote to overthrow. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=653.0s)]
*  And that distinction, it's parliamentary gibberish, but it was important to Democrats because they can go home and say they just prevented Marjorie Taylor Greene from getting her vote. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=657.0s)]
*  That's very important because 163 Democrats effectively voted to save Mike Johnson, you know, in this job, a man who they've described as an election denier, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=665.0s)]
*  dangerous to democracy, who, you know, earlier today they accused of scaremongering with this election bill, standing with a bunch of other election deniers as well. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=675.0s)]
*  So what Democrats are trying to do here is present themselves as the adults in the room to present themselves as team normal against a bunch of squabbling children and extremists. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=682.0s)]
*  And that's the narrative that they hope to ride this fall. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=691.0s)]
*  Chris. Yeah. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=694.0s)]
*  The other thing I would note here is that unlike McCarthy, Johnson clearly negotiated with them. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=695.0s)]
*  And it was when I was covering the McCarthy stuff and we were on air together, what was so clear is the Democrats just didn't trust the guy. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=700.0s)]
*  And he also just never reached out. He never said, hey, look, they're going to try to come after me. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=706.0s)]
*  Let's strike some kind of a deal. I don't know if there was an explicit deal between Johnson and Democrats. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=711.0s)]
*  But what is clear is that there are open lines of communication and some sort of traditional and transactional kind of deal making happening. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=715.0s)]
*  Well, there's certainly no personal animosity to Mike Johnson the way there was to Kevin McCarthy, Chris. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=723.0s)]
*  And that's for a whole bunch of reasons. But no, there was no explicit deal. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=728.0s)]
*  You know, we've we've talked to a lot of members about this. We've talked to a lot of sources on this. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=731.0s)]
*  We've looked for any examples or any signs of a handshake deal that was made. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=736.0s)]
*  Ultimately, what convinced Democrats to save Mike Johnson was the fact that Mike Johnson followed through with certain promises like funding the government on the basis of that bipartisan deal, like putting Ukraine aid on the floor, which was a very difficult thing for him to do. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=741.0s)]
*  He went up against the Marjorie Taylor Green wing and in many cases, the MAGA wing of his party and did that vote. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=755.0s)]
*  He also did the FISA vote against a coalition of right wing and some progressive members who wanted changes to the surveillance law. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=761.0s)]
*  So what Democratic leaders saw was a speaker that was essentially giving them the bipartisan votes that they wanted. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=769.0s)]
*  And to look at that and say, you know, from now until the rest of the year, there's not a whole lot of must pass bills that have to be done. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=775.0s)]
*  There's FAA reauthorization and everyone thinks government funding and farm bill are probably getting punted until after the election. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=782.0s)]
*  This is the last train leaving the station. And that's where Marjorie Taylor Green didn't really have any leverage to push her demands. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=788.0s)]
*  She made a series of demands, Chris, that didn't exactly add up, including, by the way, the Haast-Turt rule. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=794.0s)]
*  Yes, they are still calling it that the majority of the majority principle, which she didn't have anywhere close to a majority of the majority for this vote, which a number of her colleagues noted as well. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=799.0s)]
*  I'm not going to get into who the Haast-Turt rule is named after, but you should Google it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=808.0s)]
*  The Donald Trump's weighing in on this was hilarious because everyone, of course, says they have his Marjorie Taylor Green on fighting for Trump. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=812.0s)]
*  Trump weighed until after the vote happened, after it happened, and then said vote to motion a table after a lot of gobbledygook, which was just so funny because what it says to me is that like, honestly, the MAGA party doesn't care that much about the actual guts of spending legislation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=820.0s)]
*  On the whole, Donald Trump doesn't care that much. They take their cues from him. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=839.0s)]
*  It's not the same kind of austerity party that it once was. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=843.0s)]
*  They just can't get that amped up about it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=847.0s)]
*  Yeah, candidly, Chris, Trump made himself irrelevant to this, you know, motion to vacate drama. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=849.0s)]
*  This began about six weeks ago when Marjorie Taylor Green first wrote this out in a piece of paper, kind of dangled it in front of Mike Johnson, said, don't do Ukraine aid, don't do Ukraine aid. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=855.0s)]
*  And Mike Johnson called her bluff and said, I'm doing Ukraine aid. Come after me if you want. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=863.0s)]
*  And Trump never weighed in in a firm, direct way. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=867.0s)]
*  Trump is very clear when he wants to be, when he really cares about a certain outcome, like killing that bipartisan border deal. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=871.0s)]
*  He makes it abundantly clear that Republicans need to do this or there will be consequences. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=877.0s)]
*  He didn't do anything like that when it comes to Mike Johnson and Marjorie Taylor Green. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=882.0s)]
*  You know, Johnson went to Mar-a-Lago, did that pilgrimage some weeks ago, and Trump stood with him and praised him. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=885.0s)]
*  He praised her as well. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=891.0s)]
*  But there was never a very clear indication from Trump as to which way to go, which is why Republicans voted as they pleased. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=893.0s)]
*  Saul Kapur, thank you very much. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NrtkOrF4DA&t=899.0s)]
