# ‘5-alarm fire’ for GOP Abortion rights have won in every post-Roe election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU)
*  With just five months to go until the Iowa caucus, Republican presidential candidates are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=0.0s)]
*  crisscrossing the state trying to gain traction in the all-important first in the nation race. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=4.24s)]
*  There's a notable common thread in their appeal to Iowa voters. They're touting [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  their anti-abortion bona fides and praising the Republican governor of that state [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  for passing and signing a six-week abortion ban. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=17.84s)]
*  I appointed over 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=22.8s)]
*  And last year those justices, and you know exactly what they did, they ruled to end Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=30.64s)]
*  We did a phenomenal thing for our country and for life. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=38.0s)]
*  I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. I welcome the progress on the right to life here in Iowa [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=42.0s)]
*  and states around the country. We're proud of what we did in Florida with the heartbeat bill. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=46.8s)]
*  We commend Kim Reynolds here in Iowa for doing the same. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=50.72s)]
*  As you know, the near total abortion ban signed by Iowa Republican Governor Kim [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=54.8s)]
*  Reynolds last month was almost immediately blocked by the courts. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=58.24s)]
*  While it may seem like nothing new for Republicans to be campaigning against abortion, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=62.0s)]
*  it has proven to be just really, really bad politics. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=66.48s)]
*  Because we have seen in the 411 days since the fall of Roe v. Wade all over the country, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=71.2s)]
*  Americans are overwhelmingly backing abortion rights and repudiating the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=75.6s)]
*  Dobs decision that took them away. In every state, every state where abortion has been on the ballot, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  conservative states, liberal states, the anti-abortion cause has lost. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=85.76s)]
*  First in Kansas just six weeks after the Supreme Court ruling, then in Vermont, in Montana, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=90.48s)]
*  in Michigan, in Kentucky, California, in the November midterms. Every single time, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=95.76s)]
*  voters came out in droves to resoundingly reject the Republican position on abortion. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=100.56s)]
*  And last night, it happened again in Ohio. Voters there overwhelmingly defeated a measure, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=105.76s)]
*  rushed onto the ballot in the dead of summer special election, that would have raised the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=112.0s)]
*  threshold required to amend the state constitution. It was a thinly veiled effort by state Republicans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=115.68s)]
*  to make it harder to pass a measure enshrining abortion rights, which will be up for a vote in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  November and now will only need a majority to change the state constitution. As one conservative [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=126.0s)]
*  noted, quote, the Ohio result needs to be a five alarm fire for the pro-life movement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxECF7WJfU&t=131.68s)]
