# 'Staged' Remember Trump's constant propaganda about the economy?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. I have some news about that recession that everyone said was coming [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=0.0s)]
*  I think maybe it's not gonna come now whether you believe it or not [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=5.72s)]
*  Or if you feel it or not the United States economy at the macro level under President Biden is according to nearly every metric [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=10.16s)]
*  We use to measure measure such things in excellent shape [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=17.22s)]
*  Yesterday the chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell announced the Fed will keep interest rates steady for now and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=22.36s)]
*  Forecast they will cut rates three times in 2024 now that may seem obscure the kind of thing that the business press covers [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=29.12s)]
*  Very very closely, but it's massively significant [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=36.0s)]
*  It is a hugely positive indicator that we may be through the worst of our recent economic challenges the most difficult [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=39.300000000000004s)]
*  Turbulent ones we've seen in a generation at least and next year. We could have something that looks like [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=47.08s)]
*  normalcy better than normalcy a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=54.44s)]
*  growing economy [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=56.8s)]
*  unfettered by the aftermath of Kofi [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=58.8s)]
*  As Jerome Powell explained it's not quite mission accomplished the economy our economy has defied all [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=61.08s)]
*  Expectations all predictions of doom and all systems right now are roaring ahead [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=68.0s)]
*  Forecasters generally if you go back a year were very broadly forecasting a recession for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=73.56s)]
*  this year for [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=80.36s)]
*  And not only did that not happen that includes Fed forecasters and really essentially all forecasters a very high proportion of forecast [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=82.84s)]
*  It's a very weak growth or a recession [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=89.82s)]
*  Not only did that not happen. We actually had a very strong year and that was a combination of strong demand [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=92.68s)]
*  But also but real gains on the supply side [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=98.64s)]
*  so this was the year when labor force petition participation picked up or immigration picked up where the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=101.32s)]
*  distortions to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=109.2s)]
*  Supply and demand from the pandemic, you know the shortages and in the bottlenecks really began to unwind [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  So we had significant supply side gains with strong demand and we got what looks like a two and a half percent plus or a little [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  More than that growth year [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  So the the disruptions and kovat unwinding more people joining the labor force more immigration also crucial, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  All coming together to produce growth that's above target, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=132.96s)]
*  Not just not of getting in a recession like a strong year of growth and in reaction to Jay Powell coming out and saying look [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=136.64s)]
*  We think we've navigated this we think we don't have to keep hiking rates. We think we have inflation under control [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=143.32s)]
*  We think we're on the glide path to normalcy for the first time in the last few years in reaction to that news a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=148.72s)]
*  Real indication that we have made it through this turbulence. The stock market went bananas [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=155.92s)]
*  All three of the major averages hit 52 week highs the Dow set an all-time record closing above [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=160.68s)]
*  37,000 for the first time it was such a big deal. Even Fox News had to acknowledge it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=166.88s)]
*  Our graphics guys went nuts today because the Dow is now there we go. Thank you [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  That is the highest the Dow has ever been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=178.52s)]
*  I broke a record that goes back almost two years Scott Martin is here to celebrate not only that record [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=181.0s)]
*  But the graphics that go with it Scott always good with the champagne. Yes indeed. Well, I already drank it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=187.32s)]
*  So but you know, what's remarkable, but I've been drinking too that you have [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  Sort of a while to see that right on Fox Business News now [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=197.04s)]
*  But part of the reason they're so psyched is because you know, it's good for rich people when stock goes up good for most people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=200.0s)]
*  But but but really good for rich people and it's clear that like the stock market is in the economy [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=205.16s)]
*  Remember the reason the stock market went up yesterday is because the actual economy looks like it's doing so well [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=209.3s)]
*  Now the White House the Biden White House certainly didn't ignore all this good news [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=215.48s)]
*  But they didn't take that much of a victory lap either [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=219.48s)]
*  I mean they sent out a few tweets highlighting the decrease in gas prices and inflation which are important and good [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=223.28s)]
*  During the daily briefing press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre how did the president's work to quote grow our economy from the middle out? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=229.32s)]
*  They sent Jared Bernstein chair of the Council economic advisors out to do the rounds on TV [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=235.24s)]
*  All of that is good, I mean they should right but just take a second right now, okay to consider [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  What the alternate reality would be like in this moment after this turbulence under a Donald Trump presidency? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  My strong belief is that part of the reason that people's perception the economy was good in the Trump era that Trump would be good [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=257.06s)]
*  at managing the economy is that he constantly [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  Unceasingly sledgehammered us over the head with propaganda about it day after day after day [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=267.98s)]
*  The economy under his leadership was the greatest of all time [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=273.90000000000003s)]
*  We have the best economy greatest economy. We've ever had we're the greatest [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=278.3s)]
*  Economy that we've ever had in the history of our country. We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We have the greatest economy on earth not even close [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  By the way that that wasn't true just to be clear. I mean depending on how you even think of the metrics [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=294.68s)]
*  But even worse amidst the tumble the scariest toughest days of the pandemic when Donald Trump was president [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  Let's remember okay didn't stop in 2019. He was president 2020 [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=307.2s)]
*  During those worst days when we were staring down the barrel of a mass death event that was gonna kill more than a million Americans [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=311.24s)]
*  Donald Trump was focused on that economic propaganda not even the economy [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=318.2s)]
*  Economic propaganda in that moment. I want you to take a time machine back to that Black Friday with me March 13th, 2020 [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=323.12s)]
*  Okay, it was the first week when it was clear to everyone [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  The pandemic was here. It was very seriously and it was gonna close everything down [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=335.32s)]
*  Massively disrupt all our lives across the globe [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=341.32s)]
*  What did Donald Trump do that day? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=344.44s)]
*  Donald Trump invited a bunch of CEOs of major companies to come to the White House [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  To stand up at the podium with him in the Rose Garden for an hour and 15-minute press conference [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  He used the opportunity to tout all the ways that he and they in partnership [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  We're going to fight the pandemic and how these companies are gonna help him and the first one he called out was Google. I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=360.92s)]
*  Want to thank Google Google is helping to develop a website. It's gonna be very quickly done [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=367.36s)]
*  Unlike websites of the past to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6BMYDInI4&t=375.16s)]
