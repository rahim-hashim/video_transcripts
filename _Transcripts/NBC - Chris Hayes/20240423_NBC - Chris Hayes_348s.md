# 'Women selling stories': Trump trial witness details secret 2015 meeting with Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes, day two of the criminal trial of Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=0.0s)]
*  And today we heard in great detail how Trump and his gang conspired to hide all his worst secrets, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  well at least some of them, while Trump and his lawyer continued to stretch the patience of Judge [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=10.4s)]
*  Juan Marchand. And the morning started with a hearing on the gag order that Judge had already [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=15.84s)]
*  issued, which Trump has repeatedly and flagrantly been violating on social media and elsewhere. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=21.52s)]
*  We will have more on that later in the show, but suffice to say the entire event was a huge [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=26.96s)]
*  embarrassment for Trump's attorney, Todd Blanch. Like every Trump employee, Blanch, once an assistant [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=31.76s)]
*  U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, was forced to repeatedly debase himself in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=37.52s)]
*  service of his boss because if you agree to work for Trump, the threshold qualification is to be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=42.0s)]
*  the kind of person who only cares first and foremost about pleasing him rather than, well, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=46.88s)]
*  doing your job. In fact, in his opening statements on Monday, Blanch went out of his way to let [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=52.08s)]
*  everyone know he was speaking to an audience of one when he insisted on referring to his client, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=56.8s)]
*  criminal defendant, private citizen as President Trump, and then saying, quote, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=62.16s)]
*  You're going to hear me refer to him as President Trump. This is a title he has earned because he [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=65.92s)]
*  was our 45th president. We will call him President Trump out of respect for the office he held from [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  2017 to 2021. But as we saw today, as we will likely continue to see, as we've seen in many, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=75.84s)]
*  different venues, in many different situations, pleasing Donald Trump and doing your job, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=83.28s)]
*  in this case, providing him the best legal representation, often a mutually exclusive [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  choice. That theme continued when longtime publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=94.32s)]
*  took the stand again this afternoon for a second day of testimony. Pecker outlined how, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=99.44s)]
*  while running the National Enquirer, he worked with Trump and Michael Cohen to both suppress [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=104.88s)]
*  negative stories about the then presidential candidate and to plant negative and presumably [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=110.16s)]
*  baseless stories about Trump's political opponents. Michael Cohen would call me and say, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=115.52s)]
*  We would like for you to run a negative article on, let's say, for argument's sake, on Ted Cruz. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=120.64s)]
*  Then he would send me information about Ted Cruz or Ben Carson or about Marco Rubio. That was the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  basis of our story. And then we would embellish it from there. Upon further questioning, Pecker [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=130.88s)]
*  clarified, quote, Michael Cohen wasn't part of the campaign when he said, We. I thought he was [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=135.92s)]
*  talking about himself and Mr. Trump. It sounds like Pecker believed that he was acting at the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=139.92s)]
*  direction of Donald Trump when he published stories like this about Texas Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=144.56s)]
*  who challenged Trump in the 2016 primary, having extramarital affairs with multiple women. Five [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  secret messages, actually. Or this story. Remember this one? This one got a little bit of attention, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=156.32s)]
*  which Pecker admitted to making up, linking Cruz's father to the John F. Kennedy assassination. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=162.0s)]
*  Remember that one? Of course, the substance of this trial is about what the employer did not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=168.72s)]
*  publish as part of its practice in the tabloid world known as Catch and Kill, during which it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=174.0s)]
*  helped suppress stories about Trump's own affairs, culminating in a 2015 meeting between Pecker, Trump, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=178.88s)]
*  and Cohen. Tonight, a person familiar with the matter tells NBC News in August 2015, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=185.28s)]
*  candidate Trump was in the room when Cohen and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=191.44s)]
*  discussed ways Pecker's company, AMI, could help quash negative stories about Mr. Trump's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=196.48s)]
*  relationships with women. That was from 2018 when that meeting was first reported. According to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Pecker, in that 2015 meeting in August, he told Trump and Michael Cohen, quote, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=209.28s)]
*  I said that anything I hear in the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself or I hear [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=213.92s)]
*  anything about women selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen, as I did over the last several [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=218.32s)]
*  years. I would notify Michael Cohen and then he would be able to have them kill in another magazine [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=223.04s)]
*  or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them. Today's testimony ended [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=228.48s)]
*  with something of a cliffhanger as Pecker began to outline the plan to pay off Playboy model Karen [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=233.36s)]
*  McDougall to cover up her own story of an affair with Trump. According to Pecker's testimony, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=238.4s)]
*  one of his editors approached him in the spring of 2016 about McDougall with the understanding [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=243.6s)]
*  that she wanted someone to purchase and bury the story of her affair. Pecker says he contacted [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=248.72s)]
*  Michael Cohen, who insisted on communicating through an encrypted app. Cohen apparently grew [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=254.08s)]
*  increasingly agitated as Pecker's editor worked to vet McDougall's story with Pecker saying, quote, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=259.04s)]
*  He kept on calling and each time he called, he seemed more anxious, adding, quote, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=264.48s)]
*  I assumed he had the conversation with Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump was asking Michael Cohen, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=268.8s)]
*  did we hear anything yet? Pecker also testified that Trump called him directly about the McDougall [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=273.04s)]
*  story with the then candidate saying, quote, I spoke to Michael and, quote, he told me about [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=278.24s)]
*  Karen and Trump said to me, uh, what do you think? Pecker said he told Trump to purchase the McDougall [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=282.8s)]
*  story. The former editor will resume his testimony on Thursday. We have the day off tomorrow from the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=289.36s)]
*  trial, but we already know how this story ends. The Inquirer paid McDougall 150 grand for the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=294.32s)]
*  rights to her story and her silence. But here's the asterisk, which is great. Trump was supposed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=299.2s)]
*  to repay Pecker. Pecker wasn't just like doing this as charity. He was the, the pass through, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=306.4s)]
*  if you will, but Trump did what he always does. He stiffed him on the bill, $150,000, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=311.12s)]
*  which is why Michael Cohen was the one forced to pay Stormy Daniels out of his own pocket. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  That, of course, is why Trump was ultimately in court today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByzH0xBrDWM&t=323.04s)]
