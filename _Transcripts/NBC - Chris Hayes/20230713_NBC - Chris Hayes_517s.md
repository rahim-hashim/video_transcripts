# McCarthy claims indictment of GOP 'informant' only makes Biden case 'stronger'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q)
*  Earlier this week, we brought you the story of House Oversight Committee Chairman James [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Comer's missing informant in his ongoing effort to bring down the so-called Biden crime [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  family. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=10.76s)]
*  This is the man who, according to Comer, has key evidence about President Joe Biden and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=11.76s)]
*  his family taking bribes from China. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=16.12s)]
*  His name is Gal Luft. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=18.68s)]
*  He is a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who heads a think tank in the Washington, D.C. area. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=19.84s)]
*  As we just learned, Luft has been indicted by the U.S. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=25.46s)]
*  government and is actually on the lam right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=28.82s)]
*  In February, he was arrested in the Republic of Cyprus, but he fled while on bail. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=32.58s)]
*  Luft faces eight counts for arms trafficking, violating Iranian sanctions, and, according [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=37.86s)]
*  to prosecutors, being an agent of the Chinese government. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=42.74s)]
*  Now, Democratic members of Congress are calling for an investigation into whether James Comer's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=46.3s)]
*  Oversight Committee has been manipulated by a foreign power. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=51.38s)]
*  One of those Democratic members is Congressman Dan Goldman of New York, and he joins me now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=55.580000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, I guess I start, what do you make of all this? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  It's like a bad spy novel where you have an actual spy who's on the run, facing federal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=65.9s)]
*  charges of very serious nature, including being a spy for China, who then decides, oh, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  maybe I can defend myself against these charges by laundering information through an official [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  committee of Congress. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, you have the desperate Republicans on the House Oversight Committee [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=88.69999999999999s)]
*  who will do anything to get any information that might be able to damage President Biden, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=92.78s)]
*  and they welcome this unverified, uncorroborated information from a fugitive charged criminal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=99.33999999999999s)]
*  It's truly remarkable that this is the star witness that the House Republicans are trying [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=108.26s)]
*  to rely on in their effort to attack and undermine President Biden. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=113.42s)]
*  And one other thing, Chris, which you didn't mention, he is charged with making false statements [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=119.26s)]
*  to the FBI. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  So he's not remotely credible based on the indictment alone, and he made those false [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=125.98s)]
*  in the same meeting that he discussed Hunter Biden with the FBI, which is the information [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=132.82s)]
*  that Chairman Comer wants to get. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=139.66s)]
*  I didn't realize that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=143.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=145.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=146.02s)]
*  Well, here's let me play you Kevin McCarthy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=147.02s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy's reaction to this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=149.22s)]
*  And I want to get your reaction to what Kevin McCarthy said. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=150.94s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=152.9s)]
*  No, it wouldn't undermine the case because you extrapolate that even further. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=155.06s)]
*  The Justice Department went after him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  Well, Hunter Biden received more money from the same foreign CEFC company that this informant [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=164.46s)]
*  did, much more. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=171.86s)]
*  So it only make the case stronger that the government really didn't look into Hunter [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=173.74s)]
*  Biden. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  So the indictment of the key informant makes the case against Hunter Biden stronger. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  I still cannot understand the rationale behind that argument is the idea that because the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=186.94s)]
*  same company paid these two people that therefore Hunter Biden is an arms dealer and lied to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=193.54s)]
*  the FBI and is an unregistered agent of China. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=200.86s)]
*  It makes absolutely no sense. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=204.58s)]
*  But it really does show, Chris, the desperation that House Republicans are feeling right now, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=205.98s)]
*  because one after another after another of their investigations are crumbling under the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=212.58s)]
*  own weight of their unfounded and baseless allegations that they do not have evidence [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  for. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  And that is ultimately what they're running into. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=224.66000000000003s)]
*  What reminds me, it's like if you put word out on the street that you will take dirt [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=227.66000000000003s)]
*  on Biden from all comers, it's like fly paper for all sorts of characters. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=232.86s)]
*  And it reminds me what happened in the impeachment over Ukraine, which you were involved in as [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=237.10000000000002s)]
*  a staff counsel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=242.5s)]
*  There's all kinds of very shady characters coming forward to give Giuliani and others [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  these lines that are what they want to hear. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  And then if you scratch the surface a little, it's like these are not people that are trustworthy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=252.62s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=257.54s)]
*  And this one in particular recognized that his criminal defense could be bolstered by [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=258.54s)]
*  using the House Oversight Committee. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=264.22s)]
*  He even stated to the New York Post that his whistleblowing to the Oversight Committee [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=266.38s)]
*  is why the Department of Justice is going after him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=274.58s)]
*  He was indicted months ago before they even knew who he was. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  So these whistleblowers recognize that they have a good defense mechanism in the House [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=281.46s)]
*  Republicans who will take any and all information without any corroboration, without any verification [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  and then just extrapolate beyond all reason. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  One of the things that you're calling for, this is the letter that you endorsed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  There's a select committee on the CCP now, the Chinese Communist Party, which I have [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  mixed feelings about just as a side note. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=310.1s)]
*  But their letter to that committee, letter from Jared Moskowitz, enabling a Chinese backed [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  Iranian arms supplier and making him a centerpiece of the oversight investigations calls into [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=317.98s)]
*  question whether the CCP has tainted the Oversight Committee and its work. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=322.66s)]
*  You want that committee to look into the Oversight Committee's use of this guy? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=325.94s)]
*  Well, certainly Chairman Comer is not going to do any deep dive to figure out whether [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=330.38s)]
*  this guy is compromised and is peddling information on behalf of China that might undermine our [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=335.1s)]
*  national security. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=342.22s)]
*  And if we are going to have a select committee on the CCP, as you say, with some misgivings, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=343.7s)]
*  then they ought to make sure that the Chinese government is not infiltrating this body itself [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=350.06s)]
*  and potentially trying to launder information through an official committee of Congress [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=356.7s)]
*  to undermine our national security. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=362.98s)]
*  We don't even know the extent of this involvement, China's involvement with this individual. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=365.34s)]
*  We just know that he's been charged as an unregistered agent advancing the interests [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=370.34s)]
*  of the Chinese government. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=376.54s)]
*  And that is incredibly dangerous to have as a witness before an official committee. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=377.98s)]
*  Final question for you about the vote today in the House. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=384.54s)]
*  There's a vote today. There's a Pentagon policy post the overturning of Roe v. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=386.78s)]
*  Wade that pays for paid leave for service members that need to leave where they are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=392.1s)]
*  if they're in a state that where they don't have access to abortion to go secure an [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=396.98s)]
*  abortion and return. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=401.18s)]
*  That policy has been the reason that Tommy Tuberville is holding up all high level [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=402.86s)]
*  nominations to the Pentagon. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=407.5s)]
*  And today, the House voted to overturn that Pentagon policy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=408.86s)]
*  And I. What do you think? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=413.5s)]
*  Are you surprised they keep at this given the political blowback they have already [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=417.5s)]
*  faced and given this is essentially a symbolic vote? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=423.98s)]
*  It's not going to go anywhere in the Senate. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's truly remarkable that they continue their attack on the individual [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=429.3s)]
*  freedoms of Americans, both with this amendment effectively banning any abortion [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=433.18s)]
*  for military service members who have to seek an abortion from a different state, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=440.22s)]
*  as well as undermining and attacking the LGBTQ community by banning any support for [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=445.9s)]
*  for gender affirming care to allow people to live a life that they want to live. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=455.5s)]
*  This is the Republican Party attacking our individual freedoms across the board. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=460.78s)]
*  But I am a little surprised. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=466.3s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I come from New York, where there are, as you know, because you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=467.58s)]
*  live there, a number of very close purple district house seats. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=470.94s)]
*  New York is robustly in support of reproductive rights and the right to abortion. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=476.3s)]
*  And all of the Republican members voted to restrict abortion access for members in the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=482.21999999999997s)]
*  military. And you can bet that we will be bringing that up from now until November 2024. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=489.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXYFLnJW0Q&t=512.14s)]
