# Maine shooting: Search warrant executed at home linked to Lewiston suspect
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI)
*  NBC News correspondent Sam Brock is at that house that is being searched associated with Robert Card in Bowdoin, Maine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=0.0s)]
*  Sam, we've got very, very dark images of what's going on there, but can you tell us what you can see? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=7.0s)]
*  Chris, good evening. Right now we do not see a lot because we've been given specific instructions from police not to have our lights on. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=13.0s)]
*  This all started about maybe 30, 45 minutes ago, and you can actually hear the helicopter buzzing above. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=21.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you a little bit of what's going on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=27.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you a little bit of what's going on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=28.0s)]

*  I'm going to show you a little bit of what's going on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=66.0s)]
*  The reports out that they might have him cornered or a member of his family. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=67.0s)]
*  Maine State Police just issued a post on NX to say that this is perfunctory in some sense. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=70.52s)]
*  They were executing a search warrant. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=76.0s)]
*  And in their words, it's due diligence that they were practicing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=78.32s)]
*  We actually did hear our folks on the ground, Chris. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=81.12s)]
*  Police here actually get onto the megaphone and say, come out with your hands up. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=83.64s)]
*  We will not harm you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  That is also, according to that post, practice. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=89.9s)]
*  But of course, anyone who hears that would think that there was some sort of confrontation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=92.68s)]
*  which might be what led to the sort of misconception about what was going on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  I will say there was a period of time where it wasn't clear if he was or was not in the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=100.32s)]
*  house. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  But now, as you look at the much lower presence, I would say, of law enforcement, not just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  aerially because there were a couple of drones up as well, but on the ground too, I saw dozens [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=108.56s)]
*  of police cars walking up here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=112.88s)]
*  Many of those have now gone. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=114.63999999999999s)]
*  They have not given us permission yet to put our lights back on and to advance any further [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=115.63999999999999s)]
*  than this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=119.32s)]
*  You probably can't see, but there's a couple of police officers over my shoulder there [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=120.32s)]
*  that are making sure that the media doesn't move any farther up this hill. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=123.56s)]
*  That said, though, it does appear as if there was someone here accused of 18 murders, and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=127.12s)]
*  they really thought they had him cornered in a house right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=132.4s)]
*  You would see a massive presence still. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=135.44s)]
*  That has dissipated. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=137.78s)]
*  So without hearing an official announcement yet from law enforcement, I feel fairly confident [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=138.78s)]
*  in saying that right now this was part of a normal process of executing a search warrant [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=142.2s)]
*  and not cornering the suspect. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kEYiFw3lI&t=146.6s)]
