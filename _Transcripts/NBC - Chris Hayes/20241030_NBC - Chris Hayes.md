# ‘Shame on that’ Woodward bashes Bezos for Washington Post endorsement block
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4)
*  It was part of Kamala Harris's closing argument made yesterday at the same place where Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump incited a violent insurrection against the republic. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=4.2s)]
*  The central closing question of this election is whether we will cede some of our fundamental [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=8.16s)]
*  freedoms to the will of a petty tyrant. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Trump and his allies have worked very hard to make us forget how much of a threat he [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=15.0s)]
*  is. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=18.16s)]
*  In the final weeks of this election, some of the people who worked with Trump at the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=19.16s)]
*  highest levels as president have reminded us, like his former chief of staff and retired [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=22.12s)]
*  Marine Corps General John Kelly, who called Trump a fascist. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=26.78s)]
*  All this really started with reporting by legendary journalist Bob Woodward in his new [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=30.42s)]
*  book War, where he reported that General Mark Milley, who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=34.22s)]
*  of Staff, said Trump is the most dangerous person in this country, a fascist to the Corps. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  And Bob Woodward joins me now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=45.3s)]
*  It's great to have you on, Bob. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=48.2s)]
*  I wondered if I can ask you about a concern that I think you see echoed in Milley coming [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=49.38s)]
*  up to you at that event where he told you this and in the minds of voters, including [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=55.52s)]
*  undecided voters that David Plouffe just said, which is the idea that should Trump win again, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  the kinds of folks that were there attempting to restrain him and keep him on the same page [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=67.0s)]
*  of the Constitution are gone, and that could spell catastrophe. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=71.58s)]
*  I wonder, given all of your copious reporting, if you think that's a rational concern. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=75.7s)]
*  Well, it's more than rational. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Trump doesn't like, he's a loner. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=83.28s)]
*  He's a one-man band. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  He does not like advice. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't like the truth. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  And the primary example that's being kicked around now is very painful. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=93.2s)]
*  He still claims he won in 2020. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Sixty courts have rejected that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=104.44s)]
*  Even his friend, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has told President Trump, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  I report in my book, said, hey, Mr. President, you're with the people who think the earth [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  is flat and the people who thought we didn't go to the moon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=122.5s)]
*  Get over that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=128.14s)]
*  2020 is over. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=129.94s)]
*  And Trump will go around and actually, on one occasion, I report Trump is at a rally. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  And then afterwards, he calls Graham and he says, oh, Lindsey, I only brought up 2020 [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  twice, as if that's some sort of sacrifice or compromise. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=147.18s)]
*  2020 is settled. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  It is over. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=157.34s)]
*  And to cling to that illusion now is sad. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=158.82s)]
*  George Washington said our Constitution is very fragile. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=164.46s)]
*  The system is very fragile. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=170.62s)]
*  And we have to be careful how we use this system that we have. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=175.14s)]
*  It can break apart. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=182.34s)]
*  And one of the rules, common sense rules should be when you lose, you kind of face the music [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  and not deny it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=190.98s)]
*  And Trump, of course, is denying it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=193.33999999999997s)]
*  And he's setting the stage for again denying if he loses in 2024. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  This is sad. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=205.38s)]
*  This is something you would hope the Republican Party, which still has some sensible people, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=207.18s)]
*  would drum it into Trump's head. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=215.94s)]
*  Please stop this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  You know, there's many components of a sort of free and open society, including a free [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=222.46s)]
*  press. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  You have been associated with The Washington Post for the entirety of your career, a storied [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=227.9s)]
*  institution in the American press. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=232.78s)]
*  There was quite a bit of controversy over the decision by the paper under the ownership [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=234.42s)]
*  of Jeff Bezos not to issue an election endorsement. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=237.74s)]
*  Bezos, there was some conflicting information about it, including what seems to be clearly [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=241.34s)]
*  an untruth by Will Lewis, the editor in chief about who originated that decision. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=245.78s)]
*  Bezos took credit for it in a piece he wrote basically saying it has to do with the erosion [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=249.5s)]
*  of trust and people don't want to listen to us about who to vote for. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=253.78s)]
*  You and Carl Bernstein, of course, who broke the Watergate story, issued this statement. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=256.7s)]
*  We respect the traditional independence of the editorial page. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  This decision, 11 days out from the 2024 presidential election, ignores The Washington [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=264.14s)]
*  Post's own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=268.06s)]
*  How important is the resilience of democratic institutions over this next period, do you think? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=273.18s)]
*  Well, it's central. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=278.26s)]
*  And The Washington Post has done stunning, amazing reporting to tell us who Trump is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=280.34s)]
*  and that he is this person who does not believe in the constitutional order. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=290.78s)]
*  And they've done such a good job that should be embraced by the editorial page of The Washington [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=297.9s)]
*  Post. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=305.46s)]
*  They should be proud of it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=306.46s)]
*  Back 50 years ago during Watergate, when Carl Bernstein and I were doing much more controversial, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=308.02s)]
*  debatable reporting, the editorial page said and stood behind that reporting. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=317.06s)]
*  The reporting on Trump, they should be proud. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=325.9s)]
*  I know these people, they are proud. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=329.58s)]
*  And to have the owner come in and summarily dismiss reality, that is tragic. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=333.66s)]
*  Shame on that happening to The Washington Post is a strong institution. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=345.06s)]
*  It needs to stand together. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=354.18s)]
*  In this case, it's so easy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  It requires no compromise at all because the reporting that has told us who Donald Trump [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=360.82s)]
*  is, that he's this danger, Trump does not believe in democracy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=369.3s)]
*  He does not believe in the Constitution. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=375.42s)]
*  He only believes in himself and his own instincts. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=378.14s)]
*  That's been reported in a very powerful, remarkably accurate, documented way through [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=384.38s)]
*  the editorial page. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=394.38s)]
*  I know, I mean, that's a serious, serious blunder, which is more than a black eye. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  Bob Woodward, whose new book, War, is out now with so much of that remarkable reporting. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=414.14s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=415.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkD3DfArP4&t=416.14s)]
