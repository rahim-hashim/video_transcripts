# Santos sequel? Republican candidate in NY-3 special election raises eyebrows
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo)
*  One of the most watched special elections in a long time is going to take place in New [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=0.0s)]
*  York on Tuesday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=4.0s)]
*  It is a congressional district that Biden won by double digits in 2020. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=5.0s)]
*  Then it got redistricted. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=9.68s)]
*  And a heretofore obscure gentleman named George Santos won the new district as a Republican [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=11.36s)]
*  in 2022 by nearly eight points. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=16.76s)]
*  Now after Santos' ignominious flame out and expulsion from Congress, well, they're going [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  to have a special election to replace him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=24.36s)]
*  And this election pits the guy who used to represent the old district in Congress, Tom [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=26.56s)]
*  Swazi, who's a staunchly centrist Democrat, against a relative newcomer, Mazie Pilip, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=30.56s)]
*  who is a county legislator. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=36.32s)]
*  Despite the fact that George Santos managed to escape vetting and get elected, to the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=38.8s)]
*  great embarrassment really of everyone, Pilip's financial disclosures of the race have raised [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=42.56s)]
*  questions and she has not been particularly clear or detailed about like what her political [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=46.64s)]
*  positions are. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=52.68s)]
*  Last night at the only debate in this election, here's what she had to say when the candidates [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=54.2s)]
*  were asked about abortion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=58.32s)]
*  It is a personal decision, a personal choice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=59.84s)]
*  Every woman should have that choice. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to tell her what to do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=68.28s)]
*  And I made it so clear. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=70.72s)]
*  It's so personal to me. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=72.0s)]
*  So you're pro-choice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Again, this is a personal choice. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  Every woman will make that decision. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  You have been lying, lying to the public. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Now you have the opportunity to fix it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=83.68s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm asking you very clearly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  Are you pro-choice? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  I made it again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a personal decision. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  Just say you're pro-choice. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  I, Mazie Pilip, I am pro-life. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  This is me. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Marisa Cavus is an MSNBC columnist, author of the Hand Basket Newsletter, which I recommend. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  She's our go-to reporter on the George Santos scandals. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  She's been closely following the race to replace Marisa. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=106.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=107.48s)]
*  I mean, so here's my understanding of the dynamic here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=108.48s)]
*  This is a district that's probably 65-35 pro-choice, pro-rovy weight at least, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=111.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=117.7s)]
*  Pilip understands that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=118.7s)]
*  She, am I right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=119.7s)]
*  It seems like she is literally saying, I am pro-life and I am pro-choice as her position [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=121.5s)]
*  on abortion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=126.48s)]
*  Well, she just doesn't want to say the actual words, I am pro-choice, because that could [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=127.48s)]
*  haunt her forever in the Republican Party. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=131.18s)]
*  And she is trying to skirt the line a little bit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=134.0s)]
*  And so she doesn't want that sound bite. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=136.06s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=137.9s)]
*  I see. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=138.9s)]
*  That's what it's about. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=139.9s)]
*  She's trying to figure out her future. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=141.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=142.22s)]
*  Oh, she has aspirations. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=143.22s)]
*  She wants to go places. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=144.22s)]
*  And this is her first stepping stone. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=145.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  So she's doing this thing, which this is now the sort of cutting edge of Republican messaging. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  I am pro-life and everyone should get to choose if they have an abortion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=157.62s)]
*  This is sort of what she's saying? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=158.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=159.62s)]
*  She's a mother of seven. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=160.62s)]
*  So she doesn't want to alienate religious voters or people with a lot of children. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=161.62s)]
*  And so she's sort of like playing both sides. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  She's like, you can choose whatever you want to do. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  And she doesn't support a national abortion ban. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=171.12s)]
*  She says. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  She says that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  She says. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  She says. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we'll see. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  One of the things that I think is the context here for why this race is going to be so heavily [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  watched is that there's a very thin majority in a Republican Congress. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  Have you seen anything from her that would indicate that this is not a person who's basically [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=184.62s)]
*  going to end up empowering a Republican majority if that's how she's elected? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=188.38s)]
*  I don't think she's going to be any sort of stalwart or any sort of, you know, big changemaker. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=193.1s)]
*  I think she's going to go in there and just go along with the party line because that's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=199.94s)]
*  what Santos did and that's what they need. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=203.46s)]
*  And I'm sure she's been telegraphed that message. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  This is an interesting district. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  The latest polling had Swazi up by four. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=210.5s)]
*  But I think everyone I've talked to a lot of people in this district, they think it's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=212.46s)]
*  like they literally think it's going to be like 500 votes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=214.82000000000002s)]
*  They think it's like multiple people said it's the closest race I've worked on. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=217.74s)]
*  And one of the things that's been very striking to me is that this sort of migrant border [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=222.22s)]
*  issue is playing enormously in the district. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=225.66s)]
*  Yeah, you would think that the district was on the Texas border based on how much they're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=229.5s)]
*  talking about it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=233.5s)]
*  They did a candidate form a couple of weeks ago on a local news station. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=234.5s)]
*  And if I took a shot every time she said border, I would be dead by now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=238.58s)]
*  I mean, it was crazy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=242.46s)]
*  And it just seems like she's just hitting it, hitting it, hitting it and hoping that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=244.58s)]
*  that's what sticks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=247.9s)]
*  It's sort of the tough on crime thing that we did in 2022 that got a lot of Republican [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=248.9s)]
*  votes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=253.94s)]
*  And that brought us Santos sort of in that red wave. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=254.94s)]
*  It seems to me like there's been a little bit of a crossfade between I mean, what you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=257.9s)]
*  saw in New York was New York Republicans overperformed the National Party. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=261.14s)]
*  They won five or six seats that people didn't necessarily expect. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=265.12s)]
*  It happened in the sort of New York Post ambit. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=267.7s)]
*  I mean, really, like where the Murdoch empire was just flogging the crime issue. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  Is it still crime or has it been it seems to me like they've sort of switched from [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=275.22s)]
*  crime to migrants? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=278.74s)]
*  It's migrant crime. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=279.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=280.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=281.98s)]
*  The perfect. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=283.06s)]
*  As you were talking about before, I mean, with this Curtis Llewell video and trying [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=284.06s)]
*  to make it seem like these illegal criminals are overrunning our borders, that's the message [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=287.54s)]
*  that she's trying to get through. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=293.38s)]
*  It's not that immigrants are bad. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=294.70000000000005s)]
*  It's that these dangerous immigrants are bad. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=296.98s)]
*  And she complained about a playground being near a migrant shelter in the district. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  It seems to me too, she I mean, Swazi is a sort of very known quantity. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=304.56s)]
*  He represented the district. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=307.86s)]
*  She's left to go run and challenge Kathy Hochul for governor in the primary from her [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=308.86s)]
*  right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=313.66s)]
*  I mean, he was he was the conservative Democrat. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=314.66s)]
*  He is a conservative Democrat for sure. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  He's you know, which is more in line with that district. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  That is not a district that's going to elect AOC. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=321.74s)]
*  I don't I just don't get a sense. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=325.18s)]
*  I've been like she doesn't do it a lot of events. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=326.5s)]
*  I just don't get a sense of what what her politics are. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=328.38s)]
*  Well, she's from Israel and we're in the midst of this very pivotal time about Israel. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=332.1s)]
*  And I think it was a really cynical gambit by the local Republican Party said, oh, we [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=338.58s)]
*  have an Israeli ex-soldier who could kind of step up for the special election. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  We have no time to figure this out. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  And so they just thought voters would say, oh, Israel, again, amazing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=350.02s)]
*  Let's yeah, let's go for it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=353.26s)]
*  And obviously, it's a very pro-Israel district in terms of the politics. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=354.78s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  But there's no daylight between her and Swazi on Israel. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=358.97999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=361.26s)]
*  And it seems like Swazi is also trying to make sure there's not much daylight on immigrants [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=362.26s)]
*  either. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=365.02s)]
*  I really like he's sort of running on the right on those two topics. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4Rcd2VKLo&t=366.02s)]
