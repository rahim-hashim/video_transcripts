# All In with Chris Hayes - Feb. 14  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=0.0s)]
*  We saw one of the shooters, he had a brown jacket on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=3.6s)]
*  They were really young. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=5.96s)]
*  Somebody just acting out of control. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=7.24s)]
*  A Super Bowl celebration ends in mass gun violence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=9.8s)]
*  Parades, rallies, schools, movies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=13.64s)]
*  It seems like almost nothing is safe. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=17.88s)]
*  What we know about what happened in Kansas City. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=21.14s)]
*  Then Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to hurry up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=24.04s)]
*  Tonight's filing from the special counsel to try and end Trump delay tactics. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=27.32s)]
*  And as George Santos taunts the mega Congress that ejected him, new signs Republicans aren't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=32.68s)]
*  learning lessons from their losing wave. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=37.8s)]
*  Stop running around for Trump and start running the country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=40.88s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=45.6s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=51.92s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=52.92s)]
*  A lot of news to get to tonight, including a rocket of a filing from special prosecutor [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=53.92s)]
*  Jack Smith. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  The results of that special congressional race in New York. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=58.84s)]
*  But we begin tonight with the devastating and depressingly familiar news from Missouri. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=61.58s)]
*  There a shooting at the end of the Kansas City Chief's Super Bowl victory parade has [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=67.52s)]
*  left at least one person dead, about two dozen in the crowd wounded, according to police. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=72.5s)]
*  Nine of those who suffered gunshot wounds were children ranging in ages from six to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=79.0s)]
*  15, according to hospital officials. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=83.24s)]
*  Now, when the Chiefs won the title on Sunday, a record number of people watched the game [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=86.04s)]
*  and by all accounts, a record number of fans, hundreds of thousands turned out in downtown [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=90.6s)]
*  Kansas City for today's celebration. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=95.28s)]
*  It was as that celebration was ending this afternoon that the shooting began. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=98.08s)]
*  In this reporter's live shot, you can see people in the background running for their [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=103.96s)]
*  lives. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=108.16s)]
*  Three people are now in police custody, although I have to say it's unclear exactly what the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=109.32s)]
*  motive was or why any of this happened. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  The officials did say they do not believe the motive of the shooting was terrorism. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  This all happened on a day meant to celebrate the back to back Super Bowl victories of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Chiefs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  A high point, of course, for community pride in Kansas City and the greater metro area [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=130.24s)]
*  A place that absolutely loves this dynastic team. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=131.28s)]
*  Witnesses report there were plenty of people helping their neighbors through the turmoil. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  Professional football players comforting scared kids, fans in jerseys pulling strangers out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=139.96s)]
*  of danger, administering first aid. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  But it also happened in Missouri, a Republican dominated state where lawmakers have rolled [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  back gun restrictions for decades, leaving the state with some of the weakest gun laws [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  in the nation, something the mayor alluded to just a couple hours ago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's what happens with guns. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=160.72s)]
*  I won't get in a big debate right now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=164.88s)]
*  I think we're still doing an investigation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  But I mean, what you saw happen was why people talk about guns a lot. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=168.96s)]
*  We had over 800 officers there, staffed, situated all around Union Station today. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=174.8s)]
*  We had security in any number of places, eyes on top of buildings and beyond. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  And there still is a risk to people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's something that all of us who are parents, who are just regular people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  living each day have to decide what we wish to do about it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=194.82s)]
*  Jason Kander served as secretary of state for Missouri from 2013 to 2017. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=201.22s)]
*  He's also on the board of the Gifford Center to prevent gun violence. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=205.78s)]
*  He's from Kansas City, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, and he joins me tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=208.82s)]
*  Jason, it's great to have you on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=213.06s)]
*  I'm sorry it's under these circumstances. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=215.42s)]
*  First, just how are folks there? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  How are you processing this awful mix of joy and celebration and civic pride ending on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=219.14s)]
*  this horrible note? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=227.1s)]
*  Yeah, heartbreaking is not enough. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=229.5s)]
*  You know, probably like a lot of people watching right now, it's stunning when you actually [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=234.98s)]
*  stop as an American and think about how many people you know personally have either been [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  the victims of or at least at the scene of mass shootings. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=244.5s)]
*  And for me, it's quite a few. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's before today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=251.3s)]
*  And this is not that big of a town. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=253.5s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=256.1s)]
*  In fact, I've already sadly heard from some people that for me, this list is it's going to be bigger. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=257.1s)]
*  And I think that's just increasingly true for so many people watching right now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=264.38s)]
*  You're someone who you served in Afghanistan. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=270.02s)]
*  You had a sort of iconic ad in which you assembled an assault rifle blindfolded or not looking [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=273.02000000000004s)]
*  at the weapon, but then talked about your views on weapons. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=281.06s)]
*  You're on the board of Giffords. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=284.98s)]
*  Missouri is a state that's been almost a leader, a forefront, I would say, in the kind of gun [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  absolutist movement. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=295.3s)]
*  Do you think today changes that at all? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=301.26s)]
*  Sadly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=302.9s)]
*  But I think that that has more to do with the way that this debate has been framed in this country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=303.9s)]
*  It's been very successfully framed by gun manufacturers as it's been falsely framed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=307.85999999999996s)]
*  It's been framed as a debate. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=313.62s)]
*  And look, we don't know what weapon was used. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=315.06s)]
*  We don't know motive. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=316.9s)]
*  We don't know any of that stuff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=317.9s)]
*  I'm not talking about today. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=318.9s)]
*  I'm on because today happened and I'm just pissed off. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=320.14s)]
*  And so I want to talk about this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=325.38s)]
*  I want to talk about the fact that they frame this debate as people like me who believe [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=327.54s)]
*  in gun safety versus people who own guns. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=333.66s)]
*  But I also own a gun. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=336.14s)]
*  And I don't think that's what's really going on in this country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=338.26s)]
*  I think this is between Americans and greedy corporations. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=340.74s)]
*  They always talk about the Second Amendment. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=345.44s)]
*  But nobody ever talks about the fact that in 2005 they passed a law that infringes on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=347.3s)]
*  the Seventh Amendment, which nobody ever hears about. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=351.42s)]
*  The Seventh Amendment is the amendment to the U.S. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=354.22s)]
*  Constitution that says if you have in controversy in any matter more than $20, you have a right [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=356.38s)]
*  to a civil jury trial. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=362.74s)]
*  Well, in 2005, we passed this law, George W. Bush signed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=364.42s)]
*  It's called PLACA. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=368.18s)]
*  It's the what? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=369.18s)]
*  Something Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=371.7s)]
*  It's just a fancy way of saying that they gave the gun industry the kind of immunity [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=374.98s)]
*  that nobody who makes literally any other product in this country gets. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=379.54s)]
*  You know how there's like less smoking than there was so many years ago? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=384.94s)]
*  It's not because of Congress. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  It's because of lawsuits. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=389.42s)]
*  That's the reason my car and your car doesn't flip over on the road because of lawsuits. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  That's why truckers have to get a certain amount of sleep before they get on the road. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=395.18s)]
*  Congress didn't do that stuff. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  Lawsuits did that stuff and everybody likes to demonize them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=400.06s)]
*  But when 12 reasonable people can come together, call the jury, and make a decision about what's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=403.62s)]
*  reasonable in their community, oftentimes they're going to decide, as they started to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=410.26s)]
*  in the 90s, that gun companies actually can foresee a lot of damage being done and that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=414.74s)]
*  they can look into who's buying these guns. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=419.9s)]
*  Now gun companies, by the way, have they have the ability to make guns, smart guns. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=422.18s)]
*  Most illegal gun crime happens with stolen guns. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  If smart gun technology were out there, which is never going to get mandated by Congress, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=431.34s)]
*  you wouldn't have this happen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=435.29999999999995s)]
*  But if you just, you don't have to change a bunch of laws. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=436.29999999999995s)]
*  If you just remove literally like the dumbest law we have on the books, the gun industry [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=438.82s)]
*  is going to police itself. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=444.5s)]
*  They're going to be begging us to police them because of the liability they're going to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  have. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=448.9s)]
*  So that's what I think about in addition to the people in my community who have been hurt. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=450.73999999999995s)]
*  This is the governmental side of what I think about on a day like today. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=455.73999999999995s)]
*  It makes me very angry. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=460.5s)]
*  I mean, thinking about this, when you see these images, right, of course, you know, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=461.5s)]
*  the danger of just this object, right, and it being out there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=465.90000000000003s)]
*  And there's all sorts of ways, all sorts of things. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=468.98s)]
*  There's all the security, there's safety. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=471.38s)]
*  You got police officers, you got areas taped off. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=473.18s)]
*  You don't want cars going there, right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  There's all sorts of ways in which the space is protected and regulated. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  And yet this one device, which is a particularly deadly and dangerous device, and we have more [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=482.22s)]
*  of them in our country than anywhere else, is going to end up at a scene like that, as [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=488.3s)]
*  we're seeing now. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=493.1s)]
*  And the aftermath of it will be predictable. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=494.1s)]
*  And we have to find some way of attacking that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=495.66s)]
*  And I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=499.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=501.26000000000005s)]
*  What they do is they try and overwhelm us with the difficulty of the problem. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=503.74s)]
*  They say over and over again, like in assault weapons, they say, well, how are you going [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  to define what an assault weapon is? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=511.98s)]
*  Which is a stupid question, but let's pretend it's not for a second, right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=513.62s)]
*  They'll say, well, how are you going to, you know, they'll say, well, this crime or that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  crime was committed with a gun that was already illegal. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=521.4599999999999s)]
*  It was illegal for them to have a gun. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=523.74s)]
*  Oh, and then you say, well, should we perhaps pass smart gun technology and require it? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=525.18s)]
*  They say, well, how are you going to define that? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, the answer is you just let juries do it over and over and over again. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=531.42s)]
*  And pretty soon gun companies, here's what they're going to do. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=535.4599999999999s)]
*  I promise you, not only are they going to do all these things on their own to avoid [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=539.66s)]
*  losing their butt in court all the time, they're going to end up making a ton of money because [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=543.42s)]
*  they'll start gun insurance, side companies, subsidiaries. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, you'll have you'll have a registry of guns because they can't create [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=551.34s)]
*  a need for gun insurance if they don't know everybody who owns their guns. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=555.38s)]
*  So they're going to make plenty of money if we do it the other way. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=560.78s)]
*  They don't want to do anything difficult. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=564.42s)]
*  So all we got to do is get rid of one stupid law and a whole lot of the things that we [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=565.7s)]
*  need in order to keep people safe in this country are going to happen. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=570.14s)]
*  Jason Kander, a proud son of Kansas City, and great to have you on. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=573.9s)]
*  I'm sorry it's under these circumstances. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=578.54s)]
*  Great to see you, though, sir. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=579.86s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=581.9s)]
*  Up next, another story that broke in the last couple of hours, special counsel Jack Smith [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=583.5s)]
*  didn't wait at all until the deadline to file his response to the latest Trump immunity [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=588.58s)]
*  tactic. He is insisting Supreme Court acts without delay. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=592.58s)]
*  Full details ahead. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=596.34s)]
*  Tonight, just a couple of hours ago, special counsel Jack Smith filed a response to Donald [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=600.66s)]
*  Trump's request for absolute immunity in the case to steal the twenty twenty election. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=604.6999999999999s)]
*  You'll remember a D.C. court of appeals panel unanimously rejected Trump's claim of [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=609.14s)]
*  immunity in a powerful ruling last week. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=614.06s)]
*  On Monday, the ex-president asked the Supreme Court to stay that ruling part of his attempt [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=616.54s)]
*  to keep delaying a trial. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=621.62s)]
*  And a couple of hours ago, Jack Smith responded. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=623.14s)]
*  Now, the Supreme Court had given Smith a week to respond. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=625.98s)]
*  He did it in a day, showing his sense of urgency in resolving this as fast as possible [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=628.22s)]
*  so that Trump can face trial before the November election. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=633.86s)]
*  He writes, The stay should be denied because of applicants failure to meet this court [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=637.46s)]
*  settled standards. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=641.5400000000001s)]
*  The charge crimes strike at the heart of our democracy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=642.9s)]
*  Our president's alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart the peaceful [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=645.74s)]
*  transfer of power to successor should be the last place to recognize a novel form of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=650.22s)]
*  absolute immunity from federal criminal law. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=655.3000000000001s)]
*  He continues that Trump's interlocutory appeal, that is his appeal before the trial even [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=658.3000000000001s)]
*  happens, already, quote, place the district court proceedings on hold, thus delaying the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=662.78s)]
*  trial and verdict in this case. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  He has no entitlement to a further stay while seeking discretionary review from this court. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=668.98s)]
*  Delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=675.58s)]
*  speedy and fair verdict, a compelling interest in every criminal case and one that has [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=680.02s)]
*  unique national importance here as it involves federal criminal charges against a former [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=684.5s)]
*  president for alleged criminal efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=690.54s)]
*  including through the use of official power. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=695.82s)]
*  Joining me now is Harry Lippmann, former U.S. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=699.1s)]
*  attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, former deputy assistant attorney general [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=701.06s)]
*  at the Department of Justice. He also clerked for two previous Supreme Court justices, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=705.18s)]
*  Thurgood Marshall and Anthony Kennedy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=708.5s)]
*  Harry, I don't think you or I are surprised this turned around this fast because Smith has been [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=711.34s)]
*  keenly aware of the pacing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=715.9s)]
*  What do you make of the filing? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=717.34s)]
*  Well, the speed of it, Chris, as you say, really communicates urgency, need for speed. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=719.34s)]
*  There's also a kind of a swashbuckling quality, at least within the culture of Supreme [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=725.34s)]
*  Court. Look what I can do. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=729.94s)]
*  I only need a day. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=731.46s)]
*  Boom, there it is. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=732.78s)]
*  You try to top that, Trump. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=734.0600000000001s)]
*  So basically, he's making two arguments here. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=736.42s)]
*  He's saying, look, you're not you're not likely to succeed on the merits here because the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=739.62s)]
*  laws against you has been found in the district court and in the unanimous opinion below. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=744.06s)]
*  And here's why the laws against him. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=748.18s)]
*  And there's a huge public interest here to move on this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=750.86s)]
*  But if you're going to grant it, he says, we believe that if you believe it marriage [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  review, the government respectfully requests it treat the application as a petition for [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  riddance or surey, grant the petition, set the case for exited briefing and argument. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=763.8199999999999s)]
*  The government proposes a schedule that permit argument in March twenty twenty four, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=768.54s)]
*  consistent with the court's expedition of other cases meriting such treatment. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=772.4599999999999s)]
*  What's that mean? OK, let me take that in two parts, please. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=776.18s)]
*  The first is and the all important fact here is that they're trying. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=780.26s)]
*  Trump needs a stay. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=785.38s)]
*  And that means for starters, five votes, not four. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=787.42s)]
*  And if he doesn't get it, it doesn't matter if the court continues to review the claim. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=791.18s)]
*  Right. The mandate goes back to Chutkin. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=796.78s)]
*  For starters, he needs five votes. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=799.5799999999999s)]
*  That's the first point about the state. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=801.46s)]
*  The second point about the state is there are established standards for having it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=803.3s)]
*  It's not they they argue the merits, as you say. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=808.38s)]
*  But within the context of a heightened showing, Trump must make first. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=811.42s)]
*  He's got a fair probability of success. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=815.78s)]
*  He's likely to win the immunity claim. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=818.3s)]
*  They say no way, no how for all the reasons that immunity would fail. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=820.5s)]
*  And then balance of equities where they talk about speed and come as close as they have [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=825.42s)]
*  to tiptoeing to the line and saying, guys, look at this. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=830.14s)]
*  You know, we need to do this by November. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=833.18s)]
*  So that's the first part. And the most important part, remember, stay rule of five. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=836.4599999999999s)]
*  He's got to make these showings. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=841.5s)]
*  The court has to believe he's likely to succeed. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=843.26s)]
*  And he isn't, by the way, very few people think he'll win on the merits. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=845.8599999999999s)]
*  Your second point. Yes, they're saying if you really want to take it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=849.14s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, they'll take it if they want. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=853.94s)]
*  They won't. If they don't, it won't be really because of what Smith says. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=856.7s)]
*  Do it super quick as you can. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=860.34s)]
*  Take that motion for a stay and turn it into a petition for cert. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=862.66s)]
*  They do that sometimes increasingly in the last few years. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=867.3000000000001s)]
*  And let's get it on and have this by March. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=871.9s)]
*  And then if they do, probably they would have an opinion, say, by early May. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=875.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, then you have to add the big chunk of time that's been lost so far. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=881.18s)]
*  But I think that still makes it tenable. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=885.74s)]
*  But it gets really close. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=888.9s)]
*  The most important point is the argument for a stay. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=890.18s)]
*  And justices having to find that in order to grant a stay, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=893.86s)]
*  that he's likely to prevail on the merits. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=897.8199999999999s)]
*  I think that's a hard argument for them to prevail on. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=899.9399999999999s)]
*  And so just so I'm clear on this, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=903.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm a little clear about the difference between that makes a big difference [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=905.06s)]
*  whether you need five votes or four. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=908.4599999999999s)]
*  You need four to grant cert. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=910.14s)]
*  You need five for a stay. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=911.8199999999999s)]
*  And they're saying they haven't actually petitioned for cert. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=913.0999999999999s)]
*  They've just asked for a stay here. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=915.6999999999999s)]
*  They're saying if you're going to grant the stay, treat it as cert. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=916.9399999999999s)]
*  But it still needs five votes, right? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=920.38s)]
*  The bar still they still get to round up five votes. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=922.3s)]
*  100 percent. And it really matters. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=925.5s)]
*  I worked on a case where there were four votes to grant, but not the fifth [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=928.38s)]
*  for a stay. And it was a death penalty case. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=932.5s)]
*  He was executed. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't think Roberts will want that to happen. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=935.58s)]
*  It's not just that you need five. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=938.98s)]
*  That's for starters. But you need to make a different showing. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=940.86s)]
*  You need to show that Trump needs to show he's likely to win. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=944.22s)]
*  I don't think that he is likely to win. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=948.22s)]
*  And so we'll see if the you know, if the court gets contentious about that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=951.38s)]
*  But that's what really matters. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=955.5s)]
*  And also the balance of equity is meaning we have to get to this case. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=957.3000000000001s)]
*  It's super important. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=961.54s)]
*  So that factors in to stay would be very different if we were on the merits [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=963.3s)]
*  for cert, where they would just argue straight up or down. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=967.8199999999999s)]
*  Last thing quickly. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=971.38s)]
*  So one of the things he's so keenly aware of the clock and the math, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=972.5s)]
*  which is something where it seems everyone else seems a little like he's like, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=976.02s)]
*  we got he's like the clock starts and then it's 88 days. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=979.18s)]
*  He says this this case got paused with 88 days to trial. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=982.14s)]
*  So whenever we we unpause it, it's 88 days. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=985.02s)]
*  And he's basically you said tiptoeing up to the line to be like, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=987.62s)]
*  this has to happen very soon. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=990.78s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=993.7s)]
*  You know, Trump will have a due process, right, to go through what he was going [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=994.7s)]
*  to go through anyway, but then it'll be before Chuck in. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=998.58s)]
*  And he's really making it clear and court. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1002.02s)]
*  We need this. We need this now. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1005.74s)]
*  This has been true from the start. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1007.86s)]
*  When you and I first talked about the bringing of the case, it was built for speed. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1009.34s)]
*  He's had his focus on this from the start. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1013.7s)]
*  And again, move opposing the stay. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1016.18s)]
*  Remember, they moved for cert before, but now they're they're saying don't take [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1019.4599999999999s)]
*  the case. Right. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1024.3s)]
*  See, Sir, it is perfectly fine. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1025.22s)]
*  All right, Harry Libman, that was very, very illuminating. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1027.54s)]
*  Thank you so much as always. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1029.94s)]
*  Still ahead, ousted Congressman George Santos gets the last laugh after Democrats [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1032.58s)]
*  flip his former seat, but the latest Democratic win shows about the Republican [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1037.1s)]
*  detachment from reality next. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1041.4199999999998s)]
*  We've got the results of the first special election in 2024. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1049.54s)]
*  It was a huge loss for Republicans in New York's third congressional district. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1052.3s)]
*  Democrat Tom Swazi defeated Republican Mazzee Pillip by nearly eight points. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1056.74s)]
*  Swazi will now replace the expelled criminally indicted former Congressman George [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1062.3s)]
*  Santos, bringing Republicans already tight majority in the House down to just six [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1066.1399999999999s)]
*  seats. Now, you might think the day after the party would be wondering where they [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1069.98s)]
*  went wrong after such a crushing loss in what was supposed to be a neck and neck [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1074.94s)]
*  tight race. George Santos won this same district by nearly eight points just over [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1078.46s)]
*  a year ago. Instead, Republicans are defiant in their defeat. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1083.46s)]
*  The chair of the New York Republican Party, Ed Cox, released a statement saying in [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1087.9s)]
*  part, quote, Republicans will win this in November when the campaign resets to [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1091.46s)]
*  focus on Joe Biden and Democrats disastrous open borders, soft on crime [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1095.26s)]
*  policies rather than the specific circumstances that brought about this [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1099.02s)]
*  election. And I got to say to me, this statement perfectly defines the difference [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1102.78s)]
*  between the two major parties. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1107.5s)]
*  Republicans approach each election with a kind of unbridled, undeserved confidence. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1109.42s)]
*  They believe the voters are with them. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1114.18s)]
*  They think they represent real Americans and therefore the real majority of the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1115.94s)]
*  country. According to Republicans, Democrats are the party of the out of touch elite, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1120.18s)]
*  the freaks, minorities. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1124.9s)]
*  So Republicans should not have to think about whether their message is working or [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1127.02s)]
*  whether they are running good candidates. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1130.8200000000002s)]
*  It is simply their destiny. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1132.38s)]
*  It is their fate to be voted into power. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1134.02s)]
*  But of course, what we keep seeing over and over in 2020, 2022 and now 2024 is that [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1137.18s)]
*  the majority of Americans do not like the candidates Republicans are running or the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1143.74s)]
*  messages they are pushing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1147.6200000000001s)]
*  And the party refuses to learn that lesson in election after election. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1149.18s)]
*  They run unlikeable candidates on ridiculous issues and they lose. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1153.1000000000001s)]
*  Mazy Pilla was a soldier who fought terrorism, who supports stronger borders and [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1159.02s)]
*  lower taxes. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1163.98s)]
*  Thomas was he open the border? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1164.98s)]
*  Thomas was he funding the sanctuary city? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1167.3799999999999s)]
*  We will wage a war on the woke. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1170.5s)]
*  We will never, ever surrender to the woke mob. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1173.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm Dave White and I'll never let CRT be taught in our classrooms. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1177.02s)]
*  There's nothing racist about stopping critical race theory. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1180.7s)]
*  We've got to get this transgender ideology out of our schools. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1184.02s)]
*  My senior year, I was forced to compete against a biological male. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1186.54s)]
*  That's unfair and wrong. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1190.4199999999998s)]
*  Which one of you is from the New York Times? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1192.34s)]
*  You know, there's only two genders, right? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1194.98s)]
*  Every one of those candidates lost, but the Republican Party didn't learn from Curry [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1199.46s)]
*  Lake and trans swimmers or Josh Mandel and CRT or Ron DeSantis in the warm woke. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1203.3799999999999s)]
*  They won't learn from Mazy Pilla and crime in the border either. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1208.06s)]
*  Imagine, though, for a moment, if the shoe were on the other foot. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1211.74s)]
*  I mean, it was totally possible, right, that we wake up this morning and the Democrat [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1214.06s)]
*  had lost this race in New York. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1217.22s)]
*  And just imagine, imagine the amount of second guessing that would be circulating in [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1218.82s)]
*  the party in progressive and center-left circles in the mainstream press on the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1222.98s)]
*  op-ed pages of the New York Times. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1227.3s)]
*  It would be constant because the Democratic Party and the larger coalition is in a near [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1229.22s)]
*  constant state of anxiety. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1233.7s)]
*  They're always worried that their coalition will crack, that they will lose the support [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1235.54s)]
*  of real Americans. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1239.06s)]
*  I think part of that is because the party apparatus is in fact dominated by college [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1241.02s)]
*  educated people living in big metro areas, big cities who make up a disproportionate [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1245.98s)]
*  number of campaign political staffers, actual elected officials and the media. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1250.78s)]
*  And especially since 2016, that group of folks really does fear they're missing something, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1255.42s)]
*  something key about what voters not in those circles think. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1261.78s)]
*  Now, that fear that they're missing something can be pretty neurotic and debilitating. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1267.1s)]
*  It's the source of like the hundreds of diner safari pieces we've all read. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1271.3799999999999s)]
*  But I will say this, I think it's also an important, helpful effect. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1276.3799999999999s)]
*  The whole point of politics and elections is to win the support of a majority of people. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1281.3s)]
*  So if you're always worried about losing them, you have to really engage with what the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1285.3s)]
*  voters think and feel, how to reach them. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1289.22s)]
*  It does, I think, keep the Democratic Party tethered to reality, while Republicans [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1291.66s)]
*  increasingly are just about the opposite of that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1296.06s)]
*  They are so convinced of their own virtue. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1298.66s)]
*  They've completely lost sight of the fact that on a lot of topics, they're the ones [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1300.86s)]
*  that actually sound like freaks and weirdos. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1304.66s)]
*  They are so certain they are the real Americans. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1307.22s)]
*  They cannot see how far they are from them. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1309.5s)]
*  Here's a perfect example. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1313.22s)]
*  Republicans about how lost Republicans are, the conservative uproar about Taylor [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1315.98s)]
*  Swift and Travis Kelsey. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1322.74s)]
*  Somehow, Republicans are threatened by the image of the towering square jawed, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1324.86s)]
*  conventionally handsome star athlete kissing his blonde, red lipped, conventionally [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1328.66s)]

*  She's Miss Americana and he's the heart-baked prince. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1338.98s)]
*  It's like a 1950s James Dean daydream. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1341.7s)]
*  They are quintessentially middle America, conservative coded as it gets. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1344.86s)]
*  Republicans have so alienated themselves from actual middle America that this is a [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1349.14s)]
*  threat to them now. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1354.02s)]
*  They can't hear it, though. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1356.54s)]
*  They cannot learn from it. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1357.9s)]
*  They cannot course correct. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1359.06s)]
*  They keep attacking America's prom king and queen. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1360.7s)]
*  They plan to run Mazzie Pillop again in New York's third district in November, and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1364.46s)]
*  she'll run in the same issues. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1367.94s)]
*  And they still support Donald Trump because when you believe that you never have to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1369.5s)]
*  listen to what the voters are telling you, you can pretend that you won an election [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1374.66s)]
*  that you lost by seven million votes. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg is an opinion columnist for The New York Times, and she joins me [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1383.5800000000002s)]
*  now. Michelle, you've written about this. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1387.42s)]
*  You and I have talked about it so much. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1389.7s)]
*  I was just so amazed by the Republican Party putting out this statement last night [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1390.74s)]
*  after they got their butts kicked. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1395.78s)]
*  Like, they really thought they had a shot. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1396.8999999999999s)]
*  It was supposed to be neck and neck like they lost badly. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1398.4599999999998s)]
*  Being like, we're just going to do this again. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1401.58s)]
*  Run this exact same race in nine months. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1405.3s)]
*  And if the shoe were on the other foot, you know, you and I know Democrats would be [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1407.58s)]
*  we'd have a hundred op-eds this morning about Tom Swazzy was too woke. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1410.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, so I actually want to say that there is one reason why. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1416.9399999999998s)]
*  Look, I don't think it's going to go any different in November, but I do think that [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1420.9399999999998s)]
*  there is something specific about special elections that favor this Democratic [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1425.02s)]
*  coalition. I mean, there's a lot of reasons that the Republican candidate lost here. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1430.54s)]
*  She was, you know, they had the district had just kind of been humiliated by the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1435.46s)]
*  George Santos debacle. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1440.66s)]
*  Along comes this untested person who is not a kind of George Santos level fraud, but [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1442.3s)]
*  had been a little bit misleading about some elements of her background, you know, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1448.3s)]
*  hadn't really been a paratrooper, even though she said she was a paratrooper. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1451.58s)]
*  Was a Democrat, wouldn't say whether or not she voted for Donald Trump, wouldn't kind [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1455.74s)]
*  of wasn't straightforward about her position on abortion. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1459.62s)]
*  And at the same time, you know, this is the Republican Party has exchanged [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1463.1399999999999s)]
*  basically middle class, college educated, suburbanites for downscale voters. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1469.3799999999999s)]
*  And in some way, in general elections, that can be a decent trade because there are [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1478.5s)]
*  a lot more non-college educated voters than college educated voters. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1484.22s)]
*  But what it means is that a lot of the most conscientious voters, the people who vote [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1488.54s)]
*  in every election, vote in special elections, who vote in off your elections, who vote [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1492.7s)]
*  early, those people are now kind of the most reliable are now an increasingly reliable [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1497.62s)]
*  part of the Democratic base. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1504.06s)]
*  So, you know, you also saw this in a state house election in Pennsylvania yesterday in [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1505.3799999999999s)]
*  the suburbs, you know, kind of purple suburb where the Democrat just won overwhelmingly. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1511.82s)]
*  Yeah, and I think but I do think, OK, so that's true about special elections, but it [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1517.9399999999998s)]
*  connects to one of the points here, which I think is important, which is candidate [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1521.9799999999998s)]
*  quality, which I do think is a huge they don't they're not recruiting good candidates [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1524.54s)]
*  routinely. And I think there's a real break down there because I do think they're a [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1529.6599999999999s)]
*  little less worried about this stuff. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1533.86s)]
*  Now, with her, it's like, oh, she has this amazing bio and she does right. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1535.62s)]
*  She's an immigrant herself. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1538.86s)]
*  She's originally from Ethiopia. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1540.6599999999999s)]
*  She's Israeli. She's serving the IDF. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1542.1s)]
*  She's orthodox. I mean, it is a very compelling story, no doubt. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1543.74s)]
*  But she was a bad candidate and they keep running a string of bad candidates and no [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1547.7s)]
*  one seems it doesn't seem like they're having like an internal discussion. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1552.1s)]
*  The like, what are we doing? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1557.06s)]
*  Wrong question. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1558.5s)]
*  It's amazing how unasked that is in that universe. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1559.86s)]
*  And I think what you're seeing in the House is kind of all the quote unquote normal [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1563.78s)]
*  Republicans, people who seem to take governing seriously. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1567.62s)]
*  There's just an exodus of that. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1570.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're retiring. Right. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1572.62s)]
*  You're all seeing all around the country. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1574.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm in Michigan right now, but you're seeing all around the country, Republican [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1576.5s)]
*  parties kind of collapsing, being either taken over by incompetent weirdos, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1579.62s)]
*  kind of crazy infighting, real fundraising problems, just real sort of management [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1586.5s)]
*  challenges because, you know, the Trump is part of the party is not really interested [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1591.9399999999998s)]
*  in governing their they don't have a talent for administration. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1597.46s)]
*  They can be good at being inflammatory and kind of driving certain cable news cycles. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1602.02s)]
*  But they're just, you know, they just they're not good at the nuts and bolts of politics. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1608.66s)]
*  And so the Republican Party's in a bind because, you know, the people who are attracted to [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1614.98s)]
*  Trump sort of aren't there when he's not around. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1619.7s)]
*  But so many other people who used to be Republicans are repelled by what the [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1623.38s)]
*  Republican Party has become. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1626.98s)]
*  Yeah, Michigan's got a very funny two pope situation at Avignon Pope papacy where two [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1628.42s)]
*  people are claiming to be the Michigan chair today. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1634.34s)]
*  One of them was defeated by the other one, although whether she takes a hint, we don't [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1636.58s)]
*  know. But what do you think about this idea? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1639.8600000000001s)]
*  I go back and forth on this. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1642.34s)]
*  What do you think about the idea of like the kind of post 2016, particularly liberal [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1643.6200000000001s)]
*  neurosis anxiety that we're out of touch, we're out of touch, we're out of touch, we're [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1648.1s)]
*  losing people does have some adaptive qualities that it isn't totally insidious. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1651.6200000000001s)]
*  And that that that that insecurity can be really malign and pathological in all kinds [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1656.98s)]
*  of ways that I find like really taxing. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1662.3400000000001s)]
*  But also at least does force people in the coalition to constantly be trying to check [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1665.14s)]
*  back with where voters are at. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1671.14s)]
*  Right. And you kind of will never hear mainstream Democrats just outwardly maligned huge [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1674.42s)]
*  parts of the country the way that you hear Republicans speak with absolute contempt [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1680.5800000000002s)]
*  about New York, New York, California, the coast, big cities. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1685.94s)]
*  And it's because you write Democrats are very, very concerned by losing by less, even in [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1690.42s)]
*  the places where they where they're not able to win. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1696.5800000000002s)]
*  And but it also goes to I mean, I think it definitely goes to what you said earlier about [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1699.6200000000001s)]
*  Republicans believe that they represent quote unquote the people and the people who don't [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1704.1000000000001s)]
*  vote for them are in some sense not real Americans anyway and so don't necessarily deserve [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1708.74s)]
*  representation. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1713.62s)]
*  But I think it also has to do with not necessarily in the House, but the structure of our politics [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1715.22s)]
*  where Republicans just don't need to win as many people in order to maintain power and [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1720.1s)]
*  they don't need to win a majority in many cases in order to maintain power. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1724.98s)]
*  And their coalition is much more homogenous. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1728.34s)]
*  And so they just don't need to worry as much about it about building a coalition. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1730.74s)]
*  That's right. They've somehow gotten gotten through without without it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1737.22s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg, thank you so much. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1740.58s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1742.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1742.82s)]
*  Silicon, the good news about what immigration means for America and what Democrats need to [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1744.66s)]
*  do to capitalize on it next. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1748.66s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office, also known as the CBO, is a nonpartisan congressional agency, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1756.26s)]
*  which has provided economic and budget data to Congress since the 1970s. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1762.42s)]
*  Earlier this month, it released its economic forecast for the next 10 years, which included [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1767.06s)]
*  a really fascinating bit of information that I think has gone undercover regarding immigration. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1771.3s)]
*  So the report effectively says that GDP, the growth of all of our economy, everything that we do, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1776.82s)]
*  is going to be boosted by seven trillion dollars more over the next 10 years due to immigration. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1782.26s)]
*  What's more, the federal government will raise an additional one trillion dollars in revenue [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1789.1399999999999s)]
*  thanks to high immigration rates. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1794.26s)]
*  That means that a trillion dollars will go into government coffers in the form of taxes paid [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1796.02s)]
*  that wouldn't have otherwise. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1801.6200000000001s)]
*  Let me say that again. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1803.8600000000001s)]
*  The U.S. economy is going to grow by seven trillion dollars over the next decade, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1804.8200000000002s)]
*  solely because of immigrants coming here to the U.S. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1809.46s)]
*  Put another way, the amount the economy is projected to grow each year over the next five [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1814.18s)]
*  years alone is going to be higher than the previous 15 years, in large part because of immigration. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1817.8600000000001s)]
*  In fact, the economy is expected to grow faster than it has since before the Great Recession. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1823.22s)]
*  And as the CBO puts it, quote, that faster growth of potential GDP stems mainly from the CBO's [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1827.6200000000001s)]
*  projection of a surge in net immigration, which increases the projected growth of the labor force. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1834.42s)]
*  Speaking of the growth of labor force, immigration is effectively saving our labor supply in this [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1840.98s)]
*  country. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1847.06s)]
*  Look at this chart from the CBO report. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1848.18s)]
*  Look at this chart from the CBO report. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1850.18s)]
*  So the orange line is the projected growth of people working in this country. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1852.9s)]
*  So see how it keeps going up at a dramatic rate? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1856.5s)]
*  Again, that is because of immigration. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1859.54s)]
*  Because even as our population ages out of the labor force, more people retire. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1862.42s)]
*  Immigrants, most of whom are adults of working age, are coming in to fill the gaps. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1866.5800000000002s)]
*  All of which is to say it's not a zero sum game at all. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1871.38s)]
*  It's not people coming to take your piece of the pie for themselves. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1876.42s)]
*  The pie itself is just getting bigger. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1880.3400000000001s)]
*  We're making more stuff. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1883.14s)]
*  There's more growth. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1884.9s)]
*  To put it in raw numbers, the CBO projects the labor force in 2033, the amount of people [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1887.14s)]
*  working in this country and contributing to the economy will be larger by more than 5 million [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1891.8600000000001s)]
*  people, mainly because of immigration. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1897.0600000000002s)]
*  Again, more people working and paying taxes and into Social Security. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1900.5s)]
*  It also means more people buying houses, more people building houses, as CBO notes, quote, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1904.3400000000001s)]
*  because immigrants tend to live with family or friends initially and form their own households [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1909.54s)]
*  gradually, higher rates of immigration will continue to stimulate construction of new homes [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1913.3s)]
*  during the second half of the 2020s. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1918.42s)]
*  Also worth noting, immigrants are more likely to start businesses than [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1921.1399999999999s)]
*  native born Americans, yet another boon to economic growth. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1924.74s)]
*  But you don't have to take my word for it or even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1928.98s)]
*  Just listen to Donald Trump's handpicked chairman of the Federal Reserve. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1933.06s)]
*  The U.S. economy has benefited from immigration and frankly, just in the last year, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1937.06s)]
*  a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1944.02s)]
*  returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1949.94s)]
*  The country needed the workers. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1953.94s)]
*  It did. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1955.78s)]
*  Right now, immigration, the border specifically, are arguably among the most dominant issues in [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1957.3s)]
*  all of American politics. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1961.94s)]
*  It's why Republicans in the House impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1963.3s)]
*  last night by one vote. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1967.78s)]
*  Well, that was really more of a political stunt than anything else. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1969.86s)]
*  It was certainly the number one issue in yesterday's special election in New York's [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1973.3s)]
*  third congressional district. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1976.8999999999999s)]
*  While it's true, migration has produced genuine stress on a whole bunch of social [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1978.8999999999999s)]
*  systems in cities across the U.S., including here in New York. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1983.1399999999999s)]
*  I gotta say, the consistent tenor of the rhetoric surrounding immigrants in this country [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1986.58s)]
*  is maddening. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1992.34s)]
*  There's this notion that is embedded in the conversation about people coming across the [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1994.8999999999999s)]
*  border in right-wing media, though by no means exclusively, which basically posits that life [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=1999.54s)]
*  in America is a zero-sum game, that there's only so much stuff and then when you add more people, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2005.78s)]
*  they come and take it. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2011.3s)]
*  They're gonna come take your stuff. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2012.5s)]
*  And it's just wrong. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2014.9799999999998s)]
*  In the most basic way, it completely fails to account for the obvious gift and bounty [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2016.66s)]
*  that is and has been immigration to the United States. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2022.42s)]
*  The countless social and cultural benefits, sure, but just the sheer dollars and cents, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2026.74s)]
*  massive benefit to our economy. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2032.1000000000001s)]
*  And so as we get closer and closer to November's election, you're gonna hear politicians, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2035.54s)]
*  perhaps even politicians of both parties, demonize migrants to score political points. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2039.22s)]
*  But if you care about the growth of the U.S. economy and more deeply about the strength [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2046.1000000000001s)]
*  of our country as a whole, about the greatness of America, we should be grateful for our [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2050.1s)]
*  immigration rates and find ways to make paths into this great country more orderly and humane. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2056.34s)]
*  In the weeks ahead of last night's New York special election, polling made it clear many voters [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2066.26s)]
*  rate the border in that district as a top issue and that Republicans have a huge advantage on it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2070.34s)]
*  That is why you are seeing Republicans and Fox News continue to cover the issue. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2075.86s)]
*  I mean, relentlessly doesn't even begin to describe it. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2080.26s)]
*  But over the course of that New York campaign, Senate Democrats announced their work on a [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2083.6200000000003s)]
*  bipartisan immigration bill, one that Republican negotiator Senator James Lankford said was a [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2087.38s)]
*  strong conservative border bill. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2092.82s)]
*  The Border Patrol Union even endorsed it, which was shocking. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2095.2200000000003s)]
*  And then Donald Trump just killed it because he wants the border to be as chaotic as possible [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2099.6200000000003s)]
*  so that he can run on it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2104.58s)]
*  And he basically told everyone that. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2106.18s)]
*  So the newest member of the New York congressional delegation, Tom Swasey, turned it to an advantage [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2108.42s)]
*  in the special election. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2112.58s)]
*  He spent a lot of time talking about the border, attacking his opponent for being against that [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2113.7799999999997s)]
*  bipartisan bill, and that strategy appears to have worked. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2117.94s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Grace Meng, who represents New York's 6th [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2122.18s)]
*  District that is right next to the western side of New York 3, encompassing much of northeastern [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2126.2599999999998s)]
*  Queens. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2131.86s)]
*  Congresswoman Meng, it's great to have you. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2132.2599999999998s)]
*  I saw this tweet of you at the LIR Bayside stop handing out lit. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2133.94s)]
*  I heard from people that were working on this campaign that you were tireless working on [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2140.66s)]
*  this election. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2145.62s)]
*  Why were you, why did you think this race was so important? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2146.18s)]
*  Well, this is a race that we knew was going to be a difficult campaign. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2151.38s)]
*  This is a race that was the Republican Party's to lose. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2155.3s)]
*  And so what we've seen is that we had a candidate who was someone who would finally be able to [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2159.54s)]
*  provide proper and deserved representation for the constituents and the families of the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2166.58s)]
*  3rd congressional district. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2173.3s)]
*  And so myself, the labor unions, the women who write postcards and underrepresented communities, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2175.06s)]
*  we did everything we could to make sure that Tom Swasey would win this seat. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2182.34s)]
*  Let's talk, show that. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2187.06s)]
*  I want to show that map again of the 6th District and the 3rd District because there's a little [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2188.1s)]
*  bit of Queens that borders your district that is in this district. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2192.66s)]
*  And we saw very high performance by Swasey last night there. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2196.2599999999998s)]
*  And your district and parts of that district have lots of immigrant communities, folks from all [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2200.1s)]
*  over the world who've come here. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2205.06s)]
*  And I'm just curious how the politics of this question plays with those voters that the [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2207.94s)]
*  message here has been, look, Swasey pivoted to the right on immigration and it helped him get [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2212.74s)]
*  tough on the border. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2217.9399999999996s)]
*  Don't let that issue be owned by Republicans. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2219.06s)]
*  And from someone who represents a ton of immigrants from across the world, what is your read on? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2221.54s)]
*  So Tom really leaned in to talking and engaging with the voters of his district. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2228.2599999999998s)]
*  He didn't shy away. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2234.8999999999996s)]
*  He wasn't missing. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2236.18s)]
*  He didn't hide. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2237.3799999999997s)]
*  He wanted to do more debates. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2238.8199999999997s)]
*  And he just got out there and talked to the people. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2240.74s)]
*  When people feel like they are being heard, they want to support a candidate versus a [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2243.8599999999997s)]
*  candidate who was rarely seen anywhere publicly in the district. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2248.8999999999996s)]
*  She wasn't even allowed to answer questions at her own press conferences. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2253.7s)]
*  And so it's really important for voters that they have a candidate who is willing and ready [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2258.66s)]
*  to govern instead of just trying to entertain the top of the ticket or playing in Marjorie [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2264.18s)]
*  Taylor Greene's playpen and just spouting hateful and fearful rhetoric. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2272.5s)]
*  You did a lot of, you hosted him, I think, at a few events with local media from a number of, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2279.3799999999997s)]
*  in a number of different languages. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  Things were translated into Chinese and Korean. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2287.62s)]
*  There was a dim sum event with Chinese Americans in the district. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2290.8199999999997s)]
*  At the same time, you have this messaging about the sort of border and migration. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2294.58s)]
*  You've also got this outreach. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2298.18s)]
*  Is there a tension between those two? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2300.18s)]
*  This is why Tom was such a good candidate because he was willing to meet voters where they are. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2304.58s)]
*  Asian Americans made up about 18 to 20 percent of the electorate in Tom's district. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2309.38s)]
*  So Tom went to multiple dim sum events, Korean fried chicken events, visiting South Asian [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2315.14s)]
*  business owners, houses of worship. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2323.22s)]
*  He really met people where they were and he talked to them about immigration. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2325.7799999999997s)]
*  He talked to them about being willing to govern and being willing to reach across the aisle [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2330.5s)]
*  to fix things, to get the job done. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2336.1s)]
*  There are people inside the Democratic coalition who, Chris Murphy, for instance, wrote this memo [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2338.98s)]
*  and it went out today basically saying, look, this is a blueprint that Democrats should learn [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2346.2599999999998s)]
*  a lesson from New York 3. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2350.9s)]
*  We risk losing the 2024 election if we do not seize this opportunity to go on offense [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2352.1s)]
*  on the issue of the border. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2356.34s)]
*  So that's one position Chris Murphy, who I have a lot of respect for, frequent guest on the show. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2357.46s)]
*  There are other folks, and particularly folks who are in the immigrant rights movement [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2361.54s)]
*  and other people I've talked to who are very worried that sort of reinforcing the kind of [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2364.7400000000002s)]
*  language Republicans have been using about migrants coming to a place like New York City [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2371.78s)]
*  is going to be bad politics and also put people in danger, that it sort of cultivates the worst [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2376.5s)]
*  instincts in people. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2382.74s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2384.2599999999998s)]
*  I think we can do it all. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2387.54s)]
*  I think we can work together to look for a solution. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2389.46s)]
*  Tom is someone who said that he's been willing to work across the aisle to bring up a sensible [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2393.22s)]
*  and humane solution. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2399.54s)]
*  We also have to make sure to include the leaders and the people who are most impacted. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2401.22s)]
*  We need to make sure that we're including our immigration rights activists and also members [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2406.42s)]
*  of our Congress, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2411.7799999999997s)]
*  Where do you think this goes now? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2416.98s)]
*  You're serving in a House that's now got, I mean, the House Republican Caucus has been [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2418.5s)]
*  the most dysfunctional that I've ever seen in my time covering. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2423.62s)]
*  They just lost another vote. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2427.14s)]
*  Like, what is going to happen next? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2428.9s)]
*  I just, they have to bring things to the floor. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2431.62s)]
*  The government's got to get funded. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2434.34s)]
*  This, you know, Mike Johnson saying he wants a border bill now, even though they just ripped [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2435.7799999999997s)]
*  up one. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2439.54s)]
*  Like, what does this tangibly mean, Tom Swazi's victory, the diminishment of that majority [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2440.02s)]
*  in terms of what this Congress looks like? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2445.2999999999997s)]
*  I think that the Republican Party is in trouble. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2450.02s)]
*  We now have up to this point four Republican chairman of committees who are retiring from [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2454.34s)]
*  Congress. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2462.34s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2463.3s)]
*  That's about as big of a promotion as one can get in Congress. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2464.34s)]
*  But they know that the speaker and the leadership is not governing, is not working on behalf [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2467.46s)]
*  of the American people, but they are just trying to make Donald Trump happy and to make [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2475.2200000000003s)]
*  people like Marjorie Taylor Greene have more influence over Congress and American families. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2480.66s)]
*  It is really wild, those four retirements, including some of the most powerful committees [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2487.22s)]
*  that people spend a career waiting to be the chair of and just being like, I am piecing [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2493.06s)]
*  out. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2498.42s)]
*  Congresswoman Grace Meng, who represents parts of Queens, was out there at those LIR stations [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2498.58s)]
*  early in the morning pounding the pavement and has a part of this big victory. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2503.7s)]
*  Thank you very much, Congresswoman. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2508.02s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2510.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RhRZuK-w6M&t=2540.66s)]
