# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 30
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes president Joe Biden says he has made his decision on how the u.s [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=0.0s)]
*  Will respond to the deaths of three American soldiers in the Middle East [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=5.28s)]
*  retaliation escalation looked increasingly likely [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=9.92s)]
*  Those three army reservists were killed and more than 30 their comrades were injured over the weekend in a drone attack on their [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=13.0s)]
*  Logistics base in Northeast Jordan right near the Syrian border the dead includes sergeant William Rivers 46 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=20.28s)]
*  Specialists Kennedy Sanders 24 and specialist Brianna Moffat who was just 23 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=27.62s)]
*  The army announcing today that Sanders and Moffat would be promoted posthumously [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=33.46s)]
*  The three were killed according to President Biden by an unmanned aerial attack from quote Iran Bakh militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  Yes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=50.66s)]
*  I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=57.1s)]
*  Do hold [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  She's a Iran has issued a state in denying any tidy attack its foreign minister said his country was not involved in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=64.42s)]
*  Decision-making of militant groups like the one that did claim responsibility for the attack known as the Islamic resistance in Iraq [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=70.9s)]
*  Saturday's fatal attack was the latest in a series of escalatory strikes and counter strikes throughout the region [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=78.42s)]
*  Following the October 7th Hamas attacks in southern Israel and Israel's overwhelming military response [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=84.58s)]
*  There's a sense in which the way things have played out [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=91.74s)]
*  Follows appears to follow Hamas's plan which was to commit an act of violence so outrageous [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  It would evoke a massive reaction from Israel that could engulf the entire region [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=100.72s)]
*  Remember back in the end of November when the New York Times reported on the intelligence failures in the lead-up to October 7th [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=105.46s)]
*  It cited the emails of a veteran Israeli analyst who had tracked Hamas's preparations [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=111.38s)]
*  She told her bosses quote. It is a plan designed to start a war. It's not just a raid on a village [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=116.08s)]
*  Despite those warnings Hamas was able to pull off the horrific attack the left some 1200 Israelis dead and over 120 hostages [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  Still to this day in Hamas custody in response Israel launched first airstrikes on Gaza [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=129.54s)]
*  Pursued a devastating ground invasion that has now gone on for more than a hundred days [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=134.94s)]
*  Those operations have killed nearly [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=139.58s)]
*  27,000 Palestinians according to the Gaza Health Ministry at least 16,000 of which are women and children according to the UN [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=142.22s)]
*  UN also says 1.7 million people have been displaced more than three-quarters of the entire population [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=149.22s)]
*  But the Gaza Strip almost half of all buildings and homes in Gaza had been completely destroyed according to the World Bank [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=155.02s)]
*  It's worth noting more than a hundred days into this at the only moment in this entire conflict where lies were saved [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  And hostages were returned safely or families was during the week-long pause back in November the cessation of hostilities [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=169.06s)]
*  There have been over the last week or so we know talks of another possible pause and hostage deal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=176.98s)]
*  Hamas is demanding a broader agreement on the future of Gaza [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=183.34s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rejecting demands that Israel withdraw from Gaza and release thousands of Palestinian detainees [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=186.78s)]
*  But if the strategic aim of Hamas was among other aims to start a regional conflict to put the Palestinian cause back at the center of the politics of the whole region [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=194.82s)]
*  Then it seems that every day they're having more and more success in that respect [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=205.1s)]
*  There have been exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah Lebanon Houthi rebels in Yemen have been seizing ships in the Red Sea [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=209.1s)]
*  They say to protest the continued Israeli military assault on Gaza [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=214.82s)]
*  Militia groups in Iraq and Syria have attacked Americans still stationed there and now this fatal strike on American troops in Jordan over the weekend [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=219.74s)]
*  The US for its part has been hitting multiple targets [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=226.74s)]
*  Houthi targets in Yemen as well as targets in Iraq where the remaining American presence is increasingly drawing protests in the Iraqi government [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=230.3s)]
*  Many of the militias and proxies fueling this violence are as President Biden says funded by Iran [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  Although it was much harder to say whether in any given attack those proxies are acting on their own [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=244.06s)]
*  Or with Iranian coordination [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=249.18s)]
*  What is clear is that throughout the region there are now many different players exchanging blows and an escalatory logic is kicking in a logic taking hold not just among generals in the Pentagon [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=251.58s)]
*  But among diplomats in the State Department [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=260.54s)]
*  What we do know is that Iran back militias are responsible for these continued attacks on US forces and that we will respond at a time and manner of our choosing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=264.5s)]
*  We will respond, we will respond strongly, we will respond at a time and place of our choosing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=273.18s)]
*  I've been talking to US policy makers since the aftermath of October 7th [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=279.82s)]
*  And one of the things they've been saying is they don't want a wider Middle East conflict [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=284.38s)]
*  They say this, they're working hard to avoid it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=289.26s)]
*  Well today a wider Middle East conflict could destroy the extremely tenuous peace in Yemen that took five years of diplomacy to achieve [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=290.94s)]
*  Countless more lives will be threatened on top of those who have already died [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=299.34s)]
*  The price of oil would likely spike, create enormous political blowback not just over there but here in the US a country already exhausted by years of war [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=302.62s)]
*  President Biden to his credit, his enduring credit, ended the longest of those wars with the withdrawal from Afghanistan two and a half years ago [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=311.74s)]
*  He got enormous amounts of criticism, it hurt his approval rating [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=319.66s)]
*  He has largely resisted the loudest voices pushing for escalation against Iran as the administration has sought a renewed Iranian nuclear deal [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  The one that was torn up by Donald Trump [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=331.82s)]
*  But those voices pushing for war with Iran escalation have grown even louder since last weekend's attack [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=334.78s)]
*  Quote, hit Iran now, hit them hard, Senator Lindsey Graham posted to social media as the very first reports came in from Jordan [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=340.94s)]
*  In case that wasn't clear enough, his Republican colleague Senator John Cornyn posted quote, target Tehran [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=348.62s)]
*  I don't know if he meant that as like a stand-in for the Iranian regime or like the actual city [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=353.82s)]
*  The looming threat now is a familiar kind of one-dimensional US logic for Middle Eastern intervention [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=359.26s)]
*  Which is to use military force to achieve your goals and when that doesn't work, just use more force [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=365.66s)]
*  It's a pathway now appear to be moving down and after 20 years of covering it [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  I personally find it very hard to see that pathway to anything good [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=378.62s)]
*  All right, so Donald Trump is now on the clock after a jury ordered him to pay over 83 million dollars to E. Jean Carroll [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=381.5s)]
*  The woman that a jury found he had sexually abused and then subsequently defamed and then kept defaming [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=388.54s)]
*  Once that judgment has been filed, he'll have just 30 days to either fork over the cash or to post some kind of bond in order to file an appeal [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=393.34s)]
*  Now the appeals process can be tricky, so Trump is trying other ways to wriggle out of the judgment including a ridiculous [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=400.94s)]
*  We've come to expect this hail mary from his lawyer Alina Habba [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=407.42s)]
*  She just tried to intimate some kind of conflict of interest between the judge and Carroll's lawyer Robbie Kaplan [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=410.46s)]
*  Because they briefly like for two years they worked at the same law firm 30 years ago [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=415.74s)]
*  Okay, after Kaplan shot down that frankly ludicrous claim and warned she could seek sanctions [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=421.58s)]
*  Habba immediately backed off [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=428.38s)]
*  Of course in the end money matters more to Donald Trump than just about anything and he's a real financial genius [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=430.38s)]
*  He's not just facing the 83 million dollar judgment for defaming E. Jean Carroll [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=435.42s)]
*  The New York attorney general is asking for four times that much in his civil fraud trial [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=440.86s)]
*  The decision on that is expected basically any day now and could leave Trump out of pocket and out of business [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=444.86s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal analyst who's been in the courtroom for many of Trump's trials [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=450.86s)]
*  Timodayo Agonga-Williams, a former federal prosecutor who served as senior investigative counsel to the January 6th committee [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=454.86s)]
*  They both join me now. It's great to have you here [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=460.86s)]
*  Let me just start on this. They're trying to get a new trial, Trump's lawyers? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=462.94s)]
*  They've insinuated that they're going to file a motion for a new trial [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=468.94s)]
*  That's even in the letter where they've conceded that there actually isn't a problem between the two Kaplans [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=472.94s)]
*  They drop a footnote saying of course we're going to address this bias problem that the judge has with us in our post-trial motions [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=478.94s)]
*  Including potentially under rule 59 [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=486.94s)]
*  Rule 59 is the shorthand for a motion for a new trial [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=489.02s)]
*  And Chris, I want to point out to you and our viewers [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=493.02s)]
*  They've tried a lot of these kind of wacky things so far [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=495.02s)]
*  They've asked for a recusal of Judge Kaplan on the basis of his relationship with another of E. Jean Carroll's lawyers [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=498.02s)]
*  They asked for a mistrial after E. Jean Carroll admitted to deleting death threats against her [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=503.02s)]
*  So this is the third time they've tried for a do-over or cutting it short based on bias or alleged improprieties [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=508.02s)]
*  And they're telling me that they know that they don't have real substantive grounds for an appeal [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=517.1s)]
*  Now, in terms of substantive grounds for an appeal, I was looking into this and talking to some lawyers [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=520.1s)]
*  It's not like, appealing a federal jury award is not very easy [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=525.1s)]
*  No, it's not [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=530.1s)]
*  And partly because the question before that's going to be on appeal is going to be really about the law [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=531.1s)]
*  The factual question of sexual assault was handled in a separate trial [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=537.1s)]
*  They cannot, appealing this judgment, then try to re-litigate that point [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=541.1s)]
*  And that's what's going to be the issue on the trial record here [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  So the factual record is pretty set [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  So what's going to be happening is they're going to be challenging legal conclusions here [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  Perhaps evidentiary or something otherwise [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=552.1800000000001s)]
*  Again, very limited [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=555.1800000000001s)]
*  Or they're going to be saying that the judge erred in finding, as we presume he will, that this was a reasonable civil judgment here [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  And which is what they're going to do after the Rule 59 motion [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  They'll try to get that verdict amended [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  Judge Kaplan is going to reject that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  And they'll take that up to the Second Circuit [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=570.1800000000001s)]
*  But I think important here, the Second Circuit, the Appellate Court, is going to look at Judge Kaplan with very favorable eyes [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=572.26s)]
*  He's a very well-respected judge in Southern District [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=578.26s)]
*  And that's one of the most, if not the most respected court in the country [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=581.26s)]
*  So it's really an uphill battle here [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=584.26s)]
*  I mean, again, it's one of these things where every day that you can avoid paying the piper is the day you win [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=586.26s)]
*  And that's basically the way they've been operating throughout this entire thing [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=591.26s)]
*  We should also note, Lisa, like, part of this is he spent 50 million, this is what we got [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=595.26s)]
*  Super PAC spent 50 million on legal expenses in 2023 [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=600.34s)]
*  On legal bills, investigation related expenses last year, according to two people briefed on the figure [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=604.34s)]
*  But again, spent 50 million, he just raised it all [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=609.34s)]
*  That's right, and we're going to find out tomorrow [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=612.34s)]
*  It's like, if you go out to dinner, it's like, well, that's an extravagant dinner, someone else pays for it [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=614.34s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you know what, file that other motion [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=617.34s)]
*  Correct [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=620.34s)]
*  What's it going to cost? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=622.34s)]
*  Chris, tomorrow is the FEC's deadline for PACs to make their filing for the second half of 2023 [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=623.34s)]
*  So while the New York Times has reported that overall, through two PACs, he paid $50 million in legal fees [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=628.4200000000001s)]
*  Tomorrow we get that nitty-gritty, right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=634.4200000000001s)]
*  We find out who he paid and what increments [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=636.4200000000001s)]
*  And most of the law firms that represent him are not big law firms that could have handled multiple matters [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=639.4200000000001s)]
*  There are places like Habba Madejo, which represented him in the Carroll case [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=644.4200000000001s)]
*  Or Continental PLLC, that's Chris Keiss' firm [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  Chris Keiss represents him, obviously, in this New York Attorney General's case [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=650.4200000000001s)]
*  So it'll be pretty easy for people like us to connect those dots and figure out just exactly what those small-dollar donors have been paying for [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=653.5s)]
*  And of course, everybody who donates to Trump campaign, 10% of that goes to Save America 2 [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=660.5s)]
*  Right, I forgot they were doing that, that's amazing [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=666.5s)]
*  It's a little 10% just like off the top, shuttle payment [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=670.5s)]
*  So then we got, we're also, obviously, we're awaiting the immunity decision by the D.C. Circuit [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=673.5s)]
*  I'm just, you know, watch pot never boils, I'm just putting it over here [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=678.5s)]
*  Back on the back burner, I'm not looking at that anymore [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=681.58s)]
*  There's Judge Ungoren is going to enter some sort of finding, right, in the New York Civil Trial [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=684.58s)]
*  And he's basically going to tell us, like, did the plaintiffs meet their burden [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=689.58s)]
*  And also how much money, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=694.58s)]
*  Yeah, he's going to give us the number, right [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=697.58s)]
*  Tish James' office has asked for $370 million [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=700.58s)]
*  But we're also going to learn whether the defendants, namely the former president, are going to be able to continue to operate [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=703.58s)]
*  a business in New York State or whether they're going to get what's been called the corporate death penalty [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=709.6600000000001s)]
*  That's also a big possibility here [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=714.6600000000001s)]
*  So we'll be looking for the number and Trump's future as a businessman in this state [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=716.6600000000001s)]
*  They're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=723.6600000000001s)]
*  Whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=728.6600000000001s)]
*  And you've taken a state that's a Republican state [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=731.6600000000001s)]
*  And you've made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=734.74s)]
*  So look, all I want to do is this [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=739.74s)]
*  I just want to find 11,780 votes [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=742.74s)]
*  So what are we going to do here, folks? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=747.74s)]
*  I only need 11,000 votes [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=752.74s)]
*  Fellas, I need 11,000 votes [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=754.74s)]
*  Give me a break [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=756.74s)]
*  It's been just over three years since the infamous phone call in which Donald Trump pushed the Georgia Secretary of State to the House [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=757.74s)]
*  Trump pushed the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to, quote, flip the state electoral results by finding those votes [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=762.82s)]
*  Since then, Trump has been indicted by Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fonny Willis, along with 18 others in a wide-ranging racketeering case [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=769.82s)]
*  Now, so far, four of those co-conspirators, you see them there, I'm taking guilty, please [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=779.82s)]
*  But if or when Donald Trump sees the inside of a court himself, at least in Fulton County, is very much up in the air [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=784.82s)]
*  Joining us now is Michael Issachoff, he's the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News, co-author of the new book on Trump's attempts to steal the election in Georgia [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=791.9000000000001s)]
*  titled Find Me the Votes, a Hard-Charging Georgia Prosecutor, a Rogue President and a Plot to Steal an American Election, which is out today [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=799.9000000000001s)]
*  Great to have you here, Michael [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=806.9000000000001s)]
*  Great to be with you [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=807.9000000000001s)]
*  Let's start on the Fonny Willis stuff happening right now, which is, I'm not quite sure what to make of it [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=808.9000000000001s)]
*  And I don't need to, there's both sort of establishing the factual record, which seems a little opaque still, whether there was any impropriety [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=815.98s)]
*  and then fundamentally if there's like a legal issue that will affect the case [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=824.98s)]
*  Right [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=827.98s)]
*  What's your reason? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=828.98s)]
*  So look, my co-author Dan Kleinman and I spent a lot of time talking to Fonny Willis, we had multiple interviews, we spent hours talking to her and people around her [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=829.98s)]
*  She is unquestionably a talented prosecutor, she was the star litigator in the Fulton County District Attorney's Office for years [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=838.0600000000001s)]
*  And she's, you know, extremely a talented professional attorney, but she's made some missteps here [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=847.0600000000001s)]
*  We talk in the book about one of them when she sponsored a fundraiser for a friend of hers who was running against one of the targets of the investigation [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=857.14s)]
*  that led to the judge saying, what do you think? This was a what were you thinking moment [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=866.14s)]
*  It's fair to say the Nathan Wade relationship is another what were you thinking moment [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=870.14s)]
*  It was a misjudgment and a mistake by her, I think she'll acknowledge that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=876.14s)]
*  But that said, taking a step back, let's remember this had absolutely no impact on the case whatsoever [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=881.22s)]
*  It didn't deny any defendants their constitutional rights, it didn't show prejudice in the bringing in any aspect of the case [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=888.22s)]
*  She's going to file a response this Friday, I'm expecting a quite vigorous response in which she will challenge at least some of the allegations out there [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=896.22s)]
*  And we'll see where it's settled, but I'll be surprised if the judge, Judge McAfee, ends up granting this motion or disqualifying her [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=906.3000000000001s)]
*  for simply the lack of any impact on the case at all [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=916.3000000000001s)]
*  Right, that seems that the threshold is a legal issue in terms of the case, in terms of her removal [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=920.3000000000001s)]
*  One of the fascinating bits of reporting in your book is about the actual person that recorded that infamous phone call [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=926.3000000000001s)]
*  A phone call that I have to say, even as we played it just now, is shocking every time you hear it [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=932.38s)]
*  because it is so over the line, even as it pretends to not be over the line, find me the votes, flip it, the cheating [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=938.38s)]
*  Tell me about who the person is that recorded that [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=946.38s)]
*  Yes, this is one of the unheralded stories of the 2020 election battle [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=949.38s)]
*  Just to set the stage here, Brad Raffensperger was the Secretary of State [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=955.46s)]
*  Trump and his team are adamant about pressuring Raffensperger to alter the results of the election [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=961.46s)]
*  Mark Meadows, the White House Chief of Staff, contacts Raffensperger's Chief of Staff [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=969.46s)]
*  A young woman, 30-year-old Jordan Fuchs, Republican consultant, strategist who was hired as the Chief of Staff [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=975.46s)]
*  and had been with Raffensperger through all the turmoil after the election [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=981.5400000000001s)]
*  And just to be clear, just to set a context here, you're the Chief of Staff of the Georgia Secretary of State [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=986.5400000000001s)]
*  You're not getting the President of the United States Chief of Staff calling you [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=991.5400000000001s)]
*  That's a big thing when that happens [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=994.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, they were trying to contact Raffensperger repeatedly, but he didn't want to touch them because they're in litigation [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=996.5400000000001s)]
*  Trump is suing them, right? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1003.5400000000001s)]
*  Completely improper [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1004.5400000000001s)]
*  And Jordan Fuchs knows the danger for Raffensperger to get on the phone with Donald Trump [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1006.62s)]
*  who has a habit of distorting anything that would get said in that phone call [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1012.62s)]
*  And she, on her own, makes the decision, unilateral decision [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1016.62s)]
*  She's going to tape the call, she puts, she's on the phone call, but you never hear her voice [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1022.62s)]
*  She put herself on mute, she didn't tell Raffensperger she was taping it [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1027.62s)]
*  She didn't tell Meadows she was taping it [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1031.62s)]
*  She didn't tell Trump that she was taking it [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1033.62s)]
*  One problem that arose after this, you know, the tape went wild [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1035.6999999999998s)]
*  is that she happened to be in Florida at the time, visiting her grandparents [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1041.6999999999998s)]
*  And Florida is a two-party consent state [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1047.6999999999998s)]
*  So she was risking potential criminal prosecution in Florida [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1050.6999999999998s)]
*  Now, I don't think that's ever going to happen [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1059.6999999999998s)]
*  Right [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1060.6999999999998s)]
*  She says, among other things, there's an exemption for law enforcement [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1061.78s)]
*  and the Secretary of State's office is a law enforcement agency [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1064.78s)]
*  But the bottom line here is, she's never spoken about this [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1067.78s)]
*  but she did when called before the grand jury [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1070.78s)]
*  was given immunity and acknowledged she taped the call [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1073.78s)]
*  It was the single, gutsiest, and most consequential act [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1077.78s)]
*  of the entire post-election battle [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1082.78s)]
*  And it's all because this one young woman, Republican consultant [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1085.78s)]
*  on her own, made the decision to do it [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1089.86s)]
*  30-year-old Chief of Staff, she's in Orlando, right, her grandparents [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1092.86s)]
*  So in the moment, she decided she would protect the boss, Raffensperger [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1095.86s)]
*  When the White House witchered, packed the President's shoe [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1098.86s)]
*  she put herself on mute without telling Raffensperger or Meadows [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1100.86s)]
*  she taped the call, which is why we have that infamous call [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1103.86s)]
*  One of the other aspects you're reporting, I think, is really crucial [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1106.86s)]
*  is the security story around Funnywells [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1109.86s)]
*  And the reason it's so crucial is, we know and I know [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1112.86s)]
*  Anyone who comes into Trump's crosshairs faces an enormous security problem [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1115.9399999999998s)]
*  Often they can't and don't want to talk about it that much publicly [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1120.9399999999998s)]
*  because it doesn't really help your security problem [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1124.9399999999998s)]
*  You do some real reporting on what Funnywells' life looks like now [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1127.9399999999998s)]
*  It was pretty horrendous, far worse than anybody knew [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1130.9399999999998s)]
*  Look, Trump was riling up his people, you know, throughout this entire investigation [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1134.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, calling her a Marxist, a radical, a racist [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1141.02s)]
*  anything that would get people riled up to attack her [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1144.02s)]
*  And she's getting subjected to these just awful threats against her [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1147.02s)]
*  against her family [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1152.02s)]
*  We talk about one, you know, computer-disguised call to her cell phone [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1155.02s)]
*  in which the guy is bringing up her daughters [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1160.02s)]
*  and saying he knows where they live and they're in danger [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1164.02s)]
*  This is a phone call on her personal cell phone [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1167.02s)]

*  Right, exactly [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1172.1s)]
*  Okay, let's cut to what I think is one of the most dramatic stories of this whole saga [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1173.1s)]
*  The night of the indictment, she announces it at a midnight press conference [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1177.1s)]
*  and they just learn that there was an assassination threat [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1181.1s)]
*  The best time to shoot her is when she leaves the building [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1184.1s)]
*  Funnywells goes back to her office, takes off her business suit [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1187.1s)]
*  This is after the press conference [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1190.1s)]
*  takes off her pearls, puts on sweats of the baseball cap [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1192.1s)]
*  and then a body double puts on Willis' suit and leaves [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR3PfLhQkfM&t=1195.1799999999998s)]
