# ‘No matter who wins’ Chris Hayes shares final thoughts before Election Day
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY)
*  Well, folks, here we are. It is the Friday before Election Day. Just four days to go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't have a show on Monday, so last time I'm going to be talking to you on this show on All In. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=5.0s)]
*  I will, of course, be there Sunday night for our special. I'll be there Tuesday night as well. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=9.0s)]
*  I imagine you have a lot of feelings in your body. You're feeling anxious at some level. I am too. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=14.0s)]
*  We don't know what will happen on Tuesday genuinely. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=21.0s)]
*  And the thing that is anxiety producing is that none of us individually has any control. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=24.0s)]
*  The outcome of this election will be determined by the aggregated decisions of 150 million or Ophelodis citizens. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=29.0s)]
*  And that's really nerve-racking. Honestly, it can be sort of terrifying, but it's also the whole point of democracy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=38.0s)]
*  The old saying goes that it's the worst system of government except for all the others that have been tried. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=47.0s)]
*  And during the Trump years, there have certainly been times when I didn't know what to think or feel about a lot of the people with whom I share this country and who they want to lead it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=53.0s)]
*  But voting alongside them is still better than any other option. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=65.0s)]
*  I mean, it's better than just letting Donald Trump decide, and it's better than letting someone I like decide. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=70.0s)]
*  The whole point is that no one person, no individual chooses our leader and chooses what we all do together. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=75.0s)]
*  Even the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, can't unilaterally control the outcome Tuesday night. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=84.0s)]
*  And he is trying. $118 million. And it's corrupt and insane that he can under our current campaign finance regime. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=92.0s)]
*  But he's desperate to an effect and outcome that he cannot unilaterally control when he could unilaterally control just about everything else in his life. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=100.0s)]
*  The genius at the core of our democratic undertaking is that we all decide together for better or worse. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=107.0s)]
*  That's true at the ballot box, and it's also true after the winner is announced. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=116.0s)]
*  If Kamala Harris wins on Tuesday, a lot of us are going to be breathing an enormous sigh of relief. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=121.0s)]
*  A lot of people are going to be celebrating. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=127.0s)]
*  But even if that happens, it will still be the case that slightly less than 50 percent of our fellow citizens voted for a man who is just dangerous and manifestly unfit for the job and attempted to overthrow the republic. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=129.0s)]
*  And that's not going to go away. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=142.0s)]
*  And we're going to have to reconcile with those millions of Americans through democratic means, persuasion and organizing and civil society and discourse. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=144.0s)]
*  In short, the work of democratic politics. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=153.0s)]
*  Now, the worst case scenario may also happen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=156.0s)]
*  Donald Trump may win and he may win outright. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=160.0s)]
*  Fair and square. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=162.0s)]
*  Because sometimes majorities do collectively make really bad decisions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=164.0s)]
*  It happens. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=169.0s)]
*  But I really want to be clear about this, about what happens on the other side of that mountain. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=171.0s)]
*  If I'm here at that desk talking to you in that eventuality, that that will not be the end of the story. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=176.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=182.0s)]
*  If Donald Trump wins the White House and returns to be president, he will absolutely try to do a lot of terrible, cruel and dangerous things. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=183.0s)]
*  There is no doubt about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=191.0s)]
*  But it is just not a foregone conclusion. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=193.0s)]
*  He will succeed in that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=196.0s)]
*  Last time he failed to execute a lot of his bad ideas. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=198.0s)]
*  And yes, as we have learned on this program time and time again, there are going to be fewer guardrails this time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=202.0s)]
*  It will 100 percent be more dangerous than the last time. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=208.0s)]
*  But as law fore editor in chief Benjamin Wittes put it back in 2017, Donald Trump's malevolence is tempered by his incompetence. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=212.0s)]
*  And there's no reason to believe that Trump and the people around him will all of a sudden become super competent if they step back in the Oval Office. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=220.0s)]
*  And I have to stress that the other democratic mechanisms we have to protect ourselves and protect American democracy still exist. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=228.0s)]
*  Civil society does not dissolve in an instant because someone wins an election, even a wannabe authoritarian. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=236.0s)]
*  Public opinion doesn't go away. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=242.0s)]
*  Persuasion to our neighbors and fellow citizens, the independent media and the rights they have. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=244.0s)]
*  We're still here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=249.0s)]
*  Fundamentally, to my core, I do not believe America is a fascist country. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=253.0s)]
*  I do not believe we want authoritarianism. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=258.0s)]
*  I know a lot of us totally understandably and rationally view the outcome of this election as a referendum on that idea. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=260.0s)]
*  But I think that most of the people voting for Donald Trump don't see it in those terms. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=266.0s)]
*  Honestly, I still think no matter the outcome, the broad majority of this country wants Democratic self-rule and that majority that wants Democratic self-rule will still exist after Tuesday after the winner is called no matter who wins. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=270.0s)]
*  If it is Donald Trump, all of us in that pro-democracy majority will have to work together to thwart his worst impulses. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=286.0s)]
*  Because in the end, all we have in a democratic republic is each other. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=295.0s)]
*  Sometimes that can be really scary, even panic inducing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=300.0s)]
*  But it's what we have. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=306.0s)]
*  And it's better than anything else. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=309.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTLbN3WUJY&t=315.0s)]
