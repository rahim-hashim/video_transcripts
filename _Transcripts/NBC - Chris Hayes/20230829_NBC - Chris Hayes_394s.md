# Trump tells Republicans to impeach Biden or 'fade into oblivion'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY)
*  With the Republican front runner for the presidential nomination getting arrested all the time, Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=0.0s)]
*  subordinates in Congress are doing everything they can to try to help them out, including [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  a plan to shift attention by impeaching the current president. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=9.56s)]
*  In fact, today Donald Trump publicly ordered the House Republican caucus to get it done, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=12.56s)]
*  writing, quote, either impeach the bum or fade into oblivion. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=17.12s)]
*  They did it to us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  One of the most outspoken members of that caucus, Matt Gaetz of Florida, is now saying [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=21.64s)]
*  He doesn't even believe the House needs to vote to open an impeachment inquiry. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  According to Marjorie Taylor Greene, Speaker McCarthy is apparently taking direction from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=30.72s)]
*  Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=34.72s)]
*  That leaves the decision to Kevin McCarthy ultimately. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Are you confident he's going to go with the impeachment inquiry this fall in September? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=40.0s)]
*  I am confident. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  And the reason why I'm confident is we had a House GOP call yesterday and that was his [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  big push on the call. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=49.84s)]
*  So I think if we were to have the vote today right now, Kevin McCarthy would be one of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=51.5s)]
*  the first ones to vote yes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=56.04s)]
*  Now there is just one small problem with this plan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=58.24s)]
*  Republicans have no evidence that Joe Biden committed a high crime or misdemeanor. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=61.76s)]
*  You don't have to take my word for it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=65.88s)]
*  As one unnamed Republican lawmaker told reporters, quote, there's just no evidence and they can't [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=67.72s)]
*  impeach without that evidence. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=72.68s)]
*  I don't think the evidence exists. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=74.4s)]
*  Others have gone on the record with their concerns, including Don Bacon of Nebraska, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=77.52s)]
*  quote, I think before we move to an impeachment inquiry, there should be a direct link to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=80.92s)]
*  the president in some evidence. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=84.64s)]
*  So they have no evidence, no facts, nothing to suggest the president committed any high [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=87.56s)]
*  crime or misdemeanor. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=91.64s)]
*  But they're going to barrel ahead with an impeachment anyway. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=92.64s)]
*  What could go wrong? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=95.64s)]
*  David Jolley is a former Republican congressman of Florida and he joins me now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=98.0s)]
*  What is your read of the calculus in the Republican House caucus and Kevin McCarthy on this? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=103.48s)]
*  I think this goes all the way back to the 15 votes to become speaker, Chris. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  You know, I sat at the table with you during the speaker vote and I said, I didn't think [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy would be able to get the votes to become speaker, largely because I underestimated [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  his willingness to sell the gavel to the MAGA crazy crowd. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  But it was apparent then that part of his corrupt bargain with his caucus was a willingness [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=127.7s)]
*  to impeach Joe Biden. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=132.44s)]
*  He wouldn't come right out and say it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  But we know that many in his caucus wanted to move towards impeachment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=135.0s)]
*  I believe Kevin McCarthy made that promise, you know, eight or nine months ago, and this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=138.84s)]
*  has always been the plan. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  So he's headed there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=144.12s)]
*  But I think it also speaks broadly to the Republican Party politics, internal politics, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=145.68s)]
*  even outside of the House, where they are convinced through Fox News and through just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=150.68s)]
*  a Republican echo chamber that the Biden crime family is real. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=155.44s)]
*  The problem is it requires this broad innuendo gap for them to jump from a complete lack [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  of evidence, depending on high crimes and misdemeanors. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  The evidence isn't there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=167.68s)]
*  But Kevin McCarthy has shown us it doesn't matter. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=168.96s)]
*  He will sell out the institution, sell out the country as well the second time around. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=171.08s)]
*  I want to be clear here, too, just about just to take a second on the on the. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=175.96s)]
*  I mean, it's not even that the evidence isn't there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=179.28s)]
*  The thing that they sort of speculate about, right, that they that they through hearsay [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=183.16s)]
*  and dot dot dot and someone told someone is a wild accusation that this Joe Biden as sitting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  vice president was taking seven figure bribes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  OK, that no one has figured this out all this time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  This just happened and no one realized it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=202.4s)]
*  But also, and this is crucial, it has nothing to do with his current presidency. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  Like it's all about am I missing something like there is no actual tangible thing on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=209.04s)]
*  that that they are even pretending to allege exists. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=214.84s)]
*  That's right. And in many ways, their allegations have actually been disproven because at the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  heart of the Hunter Biden investigation that's been going on for five years, the Department [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=223.88s)]
*  of Justice was this notion that somehow the influence peddling reached from the president's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=228.28s)]
*  son to the vice president himself. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=233.24s)]
*  And yet there was no evidence of that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=235.72s)]
*  If there had been, you better believe there would have been charges brought against the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=237.32s)]
*  son on that and evidence about the president produced. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  None of that, none of that has been produced. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=243.76s)]
*  And so I look part of this is the elevation of this new group of Republicans that are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  devoid of ideology. And this is simply now a witch hunt caucus. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=252.24s)]
*  We are seeing that. But the evidence just simply is not there and they fall on their [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=255.88s)]
*  face every time they make an accusation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=259.48s)]
*  Here's the thing about the politics of it. I remember, I mean, obviously, I was sitting at [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=261.56s)]
*  this desk for all through the Trump years and watching Nancy Pelosi often really slow [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=264.48s)]
*  walk impeachment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=269.36s)]
*  Al Green, a member from Congress, was like, look, there's stuff right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=271.56s)]
*  Day one. And again, I think there were like I mean, I think on the emoluments, I think [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=275.12s)]
*  there are a number of places where they had plausible cases, right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  The fact that he was was clearly sort of cross pressured and in conflict of interest as the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  sitting president. Put that aside. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=287.88s)]
*  Pelosi's concern was about the politics of it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  I just don't see the 10 most vulnerable House Republicans wanting to vote for a Biden [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  impeachment. Maybe I'm crazy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I'm wrong. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=301.96s)]
*  But like, I don't even think they have the votes for that, which is why I guess he's going [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  to do the inquiry without the vote. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=307.08s)]
*  Well, and the easier vote is the opening the inquiry, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=309.4s)]
*  Because even a moderate swing district, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=312.88s)]
*  A Republican could say, well, we should at least go on a fact finding expedition, even [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=315.64s)]
*  if they're ultimately a no. In this case, there aren't the votes even to open up the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=319.08s)]
*  investigation. So look, this will be an overreach should they pursue it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=322.96s)]
*  They are clearly doing it in the direction of Donald Trump to distract from Donald Trump. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=326.88s)]
*  Chris, I served with Kevin McCarthy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=331.24s)]
*  He he has always been a vacuous individual. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  Never one deep in policy, always about the politics. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  He knows every congressional district. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=339.32s)]
*  But I did not realize in how unprincipled he was. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a manifestation of his lack of principles to say, I'm willing to shred the integrity [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=344.32s)]
*  of the House to sell out all of all of the history of what you spoke of the slow walking [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=349.2s)]
*  of Nancy Pelosi to chase facts and be careful with the politics. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't care about any of that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=357.36s)]
*  He cares about one thing, his grip on the gavel. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=358.6s)]
*  And if he refuses to move towards impeachment, you better believe Elise Stefanik waiting in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=361.72s)]
*  the wings will say, I would move towards impeachment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=365.96s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's a that's a great point. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=368.12s)]
*  Really good point. David Jelle, thank you very much. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgkSxJpWXY&t=371.28s)]
