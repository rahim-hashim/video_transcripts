Video Description: “After 21 days of a speaker-less House, this backbencher with no experience is in charge. And yet nothing has changed at all. They are in exactly the same position they were back with McCarthy in September,” says Chris Hayes, as the deadline to fund the government looms.

# ‘Here we are again’: Why the GOP is exactly where it was before ousting McCarthy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The federal government of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=0.0s)]
*  United States is one week away from being shut down. And yes, I know what [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=3.48s)]
*  you're thinking. Here we are again, thanks to a chaotic and incompetent [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=7.48s)]
*  Republican controlled House representatives. Now, this is due this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=11.4s)]
*  time in some part to the fact that they've got a brand new speaker of the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=14.36s)]
*  house in charge, Maga Mike Johnson, who has literally zero experience in house [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  leadership. He's never served as a party whip or a conference chair or even [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=23.2s)]
*  a committee. That guy is essentially flying by the seat of his pants is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=27.32s)]
*  going to have to unite this unruly conference into something that can [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  legislate. And as Democratic Congressman Sean Casten noted on the House floor [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  this week, it's not going great. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=39.12s)]
*  As you know, we operate on a September 30th fiscal year, and here we are 39 [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  days later, and the majority has yet to even propose a way to keep the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  government open. The last September I kicked the can down the road, kept the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=50.2s)]
*  government open for 45 days. And in the words of Mr Santos, that made you all [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=54.44s)]
*  big mad. So you fired your speaker. Now you have a new speaker, but a lot of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=58.36s)]
*  you are still big mad. So instead of working, we are sitting here this week [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=62.8s)]
*  debating nonsense. So today we are voting on a bill that would defund the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=66.16s)]
*  ability of regulators to develop consistent climate accounting rules [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=70.88s)]
*  instead of doing the work of the people. Mr Speaker, science is real. We have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  real challenges. Please stop being big mad. As a congressman alluded to there, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  here's what's happening right now. There's basically sort of two tracks for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=87.84s)]
*  this narrow House Republican majority. The track they're currently on is one [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=90.92s)]
*  where they ignore their actual responsibilities and instead push an [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=94.72s)]
*  agenda of Fox News culture war nonsense. Congressman Casten expanded on that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=97.52s)]
*  strategy in a very funny Twitter thread, citing examples like the House [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=102.88s)]
*  Republican plan to defund the Office of Gun Violence Prevention. An amendment to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=106.68s)]
*  change White House Press Secretary Corrine Jean Pierre salary to $1. An [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=111.2s)]
*  amendment to set the salary of the Chairman of Securities Exchange [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=116.8s)]
*  Commission to $1. Now there's also some big business interests going on here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=119.28s)]
*  House Republicans proposed the plan to slash the budget of the Consumer [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=123.56s)]
*  Product Safety Commission. The folks who decide if baby toys are safe for [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=127.16s)]
*  market, among other potentially hazardous products. They also tried to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=130.6s)]
*  eliminate something they've been trying to get rid of forever. The Consumer [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=134.32s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau entirely that of course an agency in charge of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=137.4s)]
*  protecting average Americans from predatory and unfair lending practices. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=141.24s)]
*  Additionally, just to make sure Donald Trump is appeased, the third ranking [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=146.36s)]
*  Republican in the House who you really think would be concentrating like full [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  time on the Congress, Elise Stefanik has taken the time to file an ethics [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=152.28s)]
*  complaint against the judge overseeing the ex president's civil fraud case. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  That was all just this week. So that's one track for the party pushing this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=161.68s)]
*  stunty stuff, doing the business of big business while the clock ticks towards [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=165.64s)]
*  another shutdown. The other track is the actually important one. That's the track [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=170.32s)]
*  where Republicans set aside all their various cultural war amendments and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  stunty pranks in order to find a way to fund the various parts of the U.S. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=179.44s)]
*  government using the power of the purse given to them by the founders in Article [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=184.6s)]
*  one of our Constitution. On this issue, the important stuff, the bedrock stuff, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  Mike Johnson is just absolutely floundering. Now, he insists the House [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=194.6s)]
*  must pass separate bills. These are the not omnibus, but like appropriations [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=199.2s)]
*  bills for the various different agencies and entities to fund the various parts [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=203.6s)]
*  of the government instead of getting it all done in one big omnibus. Okay, fine. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=207.4s)]
*  Got to pass the individual bills. What happened this week? So far, Republicans [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=212.04s)]
*  have tried to tee up two of those and then pulled them at the last minute. Two [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=216.24s)]
*  separate must pass bills to the floor. Got pulled. Why? Because they don't have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  the votes. They don't have the Republican votes. If this all sounds a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=226.44s)]
*  little familiar, it's because it is exactly what started us down the road [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=230.84s)]
*  to begin with. You might remember roughly two months ago when former [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=234.6s)]
*  speaker Kevin McCarthy was trying to get funding bills passed before a looming [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=239.12s)]
*  shutdown deadline. Vice his successor, McCarthy ran up against the basic [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=242.6s)]
*  problem at the heart of this narrow House Republican majority. When it comes [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=247.12s)]
*  to like the actual real brass tax business of the U. S. Congress funding [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=251.6s)]
*  the government at different levels for different programs and bureaus, there [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=257.0s)]
*  are two irreconcilable wings. The Republican Party, whatever compromise you [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=260.24s)]
*  think you can come up with, you will face one group that will vote against [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  you because they think you're spending too much or another group that will [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=268.64s)]
*  vote against you because they think you're not spending enough, meaning you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=272.04s)]
*  cannot pass spending bills unilaterally on a party line vote with this [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=276.56s)]
*  Republican majority alone just doesn't work mathematically. This is a point [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=281.16s)]
*  the Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tried to stress to the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=286.16s)]
*  news. I have a speaker this week. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  The only way let me say it a third time. The only way we avoid a shutdown is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  with bipartisan cooperation, just as it was true in September, and it will be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=298.48s)]
*  true in the future. I implore Speaker Johnson and our House Republican [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=303.24s)]
*  colleagues to learn from the fiasco of a month ago. Yes, learn. We went through [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=307.56s)]
*  this room with the debt ceiling thing. They worked out a deal with spending [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  levels and then they tried to McCarthy and the House caucus were gonna like [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  undo that deal. It doesn't work. You can't do it alone. It is that simple. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=320.4s)]
*  If Speaker Johnson wants to keep the government open, he will need to reach [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=324.24s)]
*  across the aisle for Democratic votes. But if he does that, then he becomes a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=327.32s)]
*  sellout. The party fringe will say Johnson has betrayed the MAGA movement. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  They will revolt against him. We know this, of course, because again, it just [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=336.88s)]
*  happened. Kevin McCarthy could not keep the government funded with just [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=341.56s)]
*  Republican votes, so he made a deal with the White House and the Senate [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  Democrats to keep it open for 45 days, and he brought that up through a vote [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=348.12s)]
*  and it passed huge bipartisan majority. An extreme minority of his narrow [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=352.08s)]
*  majority then fired him because of it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  That compromise strategy is the only way to pass spending bills in the House. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  Mike Johnson knows it. Everyone in leadership knows it. Everyone on [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=364.4s)]
*  Capitol Hill knows it. But if he does it, he runs the risk of being seen as [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=367.6s)]
*  having betrayed the conservative cause, of not fighting enough, of being a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=372.08s)]
*  sellout. So here we are. One speaker has already been fired. At least three [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=376.0s)]
*  others failed to even come close to securing the gavel during that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  torturous three weeks, and after 21 days of a speakerless House, this back [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=382.92s)]
*  venture with no experience is now in charge. And yet nothing has changed at [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  all. They're in exactly the same position they were back with McCarthy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=391.4s)]
*  in September. And instead of doing anything about that, they're taking [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=396.44s)]
*  symbolic votes to defund the folks who make sure there's no lead paint and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=402.12s)]
*  toys. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=405.76s)]
*  Mhm. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAkZHPiLOKg&t=421.32s)]
