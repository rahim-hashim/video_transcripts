# ‘Not true’ Chris Hayes on the reality of the massive crime drop in America
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0)
*  One of the established facts from this campaign that Donald Trump ran on and Republicans all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=0.0s)]
*  just blatantly perpetuated was that crime was up under Joe Biden. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=5.42s)]
*  Trump said as much just last week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=10.24s)]
*  We're going to be focusing on crime in the cities and we'll work with Democrat governors. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=12.96s)]
*  Most of them are, you know, if you look at the 25 worst places, they're just about all [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=17.88s)]
*  Democrat controlled cities and states. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=22.72s)]
*  We have a country now that's overridden with crime. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=25.22s)]
*  Crime is at an all time high. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Our country is a crime pot and we have to get rid of crime. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=29.74s)]
*  We have to get the criminals out of our country. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=32.96s)]
*  We have to bring down crime. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=34.86s)]
*  People have to be able to walk across the street and buy a loaf of bread without being [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=36.56s)]
*  shot. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=39.9s)]
*  The problem with that, as we have been reporting for years on this show, is that it's just [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=41.42s)]
*  not true. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=46.06s)]
*  Not almost any of it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=48.099999999999994s)]
*  So violent crime, particularly murder, the most serious violent crime, did see an unprecedented [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=50.06s)]
*  year of 2020 when again, you might recall, Donald Trump was president of the United States [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=55.58s)]
*  and it did continue going up under Joe Biden for his first year and then second year a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  little bit in office. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  But for the last two years, we have seen historic declines nationwide according to FDA data [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=67.38s)]
*  and to local city data. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=73.02s)]
*  And more data keeps rolling in according to the real time crime index, which aggregates [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  city data. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  Crime is dropping nationwide in pretty much every major city, but the biggest drops are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=80.9s)]
*  in murder rates. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=85.14s)]
*  I mean, look at those numbers down by more than 50% New Orleans. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=86.14s)]
*  Amazing news. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  And Philadelphia this year compared with two years earlier. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=90.54s)]
*  Here's burglary. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=93.78s)]
*  You can see double digit drops across all those cities with the exception of Chicago [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  where there was a slight uptick. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  The general trend holds across the board. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  When crime was going up back in 2020, everyone had their theories and scapegoats. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  Critics on the right blame the George Floyd protests and the radical Democrats going soft [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=108.54s)]
*  on crime and calling to defund the police, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=112.22000000000001s)]
*  Remember that was why crime went up because of the libs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  And others said it's more likely driven by the, I don't know, once in a century pandemic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  that completely tore the social fabric and created unprecedented levels of dislocation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=121.72s)]
*  I think we can now test those hypotheses in the rear view mirror. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=127.18s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=130.1s)]
*  Yes, crime has gone down in cities like San Francisco where voters notoriously tossed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=131.1s)]
*  out a liberal pro-reform district attorney. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=135.26s)]
*  It's gone down in New York where former cop Eric Adams became mayor on a platform of more [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  cops and they've spent a lot more money on cop overtime. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=141.94s)]
*  But violent crime is also down in cities like Chicago where the mayor is endorsed by the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=144.82s)]
*  Democratic Socialists of America. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=148.94s)]
*  And in Philadelphia where the very pro-reform former public defense attorney, DA Larry Krasner, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  is probably one of the Democratic officials public that Republicans hate most in the entire [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=158.06s)]
*  country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=162.42s)]
*  Republicans in the state wanted to kick him out of the job. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=163.42s)]
*  Despite the coverage and the hysterics, it looks pretty clear to me the story. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=167.26s)]
*  COVID and the shutdowns did cause a spike in crime across the country. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=171.26s)]
*  And as the pandemic worries have receded, crime has gone down. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=175.54s)]
*  And yet, as much as we heard about the spike in crime, and that was a lot, we have heard [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  virtually nothing in the mainstream media about these historic drops by huge amounts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=184.38s)]
*  This incredible story of the last two years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  That part doesn't exist, hasn't permeated the public consciousness yet. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=194.34s)]
*  Maybe the falling crime rate will get more attention in a few weeks when Trump starts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=198.34s)]
*  taking credit for it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_fM09iRXn0&t=202.74s)]
