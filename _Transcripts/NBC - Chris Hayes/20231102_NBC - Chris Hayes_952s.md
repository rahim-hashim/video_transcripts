# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 1
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. A vote to expel freshman Congressman George Santos just failed in the House of Representatives. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=0.0s)]
*  It did not come close to meeting the constitutionally required two-thirds threshold to expel a member of Congress. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=7.0s)]
*  It should be said the expulsion bar is very high to clear and for good reason. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=14.0s)]
*  Only five congressmen have been successfully expelled in our country's history. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=18.0s)]
*  It has not happened in more than 20 years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=23.0s)]
*  The New York Republican George Santos has been a subject of almost too much controversy to list in a one-hour show since he was first elected to Congress nearly one year ago. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=26.0s)]
*  In that time, we'll go briefly here, reporting revealed that Santos fabricated much of his resume, including business and educational experience, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=35.0s)]
*  the fact that he was like a champion volleyball player, as well as personal connection to a number of national tragedies, including 9-11. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=43.0s)]
*  And then there's the fact that Santos was also indicted earlier this year in May before then getting hit with additional superseding charges last month, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=50.0s)]
*  bringing the total up to 23 felony charges he now faces, which include aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and credit card fraud. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=58.0s)]
*  We should note Santos denies all those charges, and he deserves the chance to mount a vigorous defense against them in court, as is his constitutional right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=67.0s)]
*  His campaign treasurer, we should note, who is also caught up in this case, has already pleaded guilty, which doesn't bode great for Santos. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=75.0s)]
*  But none of that was really the question at hand tonight. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=82.0s)]
*  The question was whether Santos is fit to serve in Congress. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=85.0s)]
*  And this was always an uphill climb. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=89.0s)]
*  In fact, if tonight's vote had been successful, Santos would have been the first member of Congress to be expelled without a criminal conviction since the Civil War. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=91.0s)]
*  The process is so rare because expulsion requires a two-thirds majority of the House, a level of unanimity that this body, or frankly any legislative body, has an extraordinarily difficult time reaching. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=101.0s)]
*  Interestingly, this is the second time this year that an attempt has been made to expel Santos. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=111.0s)]
*  Democrats first tried to remove him six months ago after he was first indicted. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=116.0s)]
*  Republicans instead referred Santos to the House Ethics Committee in an attempt to sweep the problem under the rug. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=121.0s)]
*  Tonight, it was Republicans leaving the charge to remove Santos. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=128.0s)]
*  The efforts was pushed by Republican Congressman Anthony Desposito of New York, along with four other New York Republicans, Mike Lawler, Nick Lollota, Mark Molinaro, and Brandon Williams. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=132.0s)]
*  Now, all five of those men have something in common. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=142.0s)]
*  They have all been vocal Santos critics. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=146.0s)]
*  They all previously supported kicking the issue to the Exodus Committee instead of a proper expulsion vote. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=149.0s)]
*  And they're all running for reelection in districts that Joe Biden carried. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=154.0s)]
*  The Ethics Committee has not yet released a report on Santos, so what changed? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, all five of those New York congressmen voted to elect the new MAGA Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=163.0s)]
*  And, well, elevating a pro-coup anti-abortion, arguably Christian nationalist, the speakership could be seen as something of a vulnerability for those gentlemen in competitive New York districts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=168.0s)]
*  So it's not difficult to imagine that they might want a distraction from their culpability in electing MAGA Mike Johnson. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=181.0s)]
*  Tonight, trying and failing to remove George Santos was that distraction. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=188.0s)]
*  On this vote, the yeas are 179, the nays are 213, with 19 recorded as present. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=193.0s)]
*  Two-thirds not voting in the affirmative. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=202.0s)]
*  The resolution is not adopted, and a motion to reconsider is laid upon the table. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=204.0s)]
*  Well, Allie Vitale covers Congress for NBC News, and she joins me now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=210.0s)]
*  The wild day in the House there, Allie. How did it all go down? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=215.0s)]
*  Is there anything else in the House lately, Chris? All of them are wild days. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=219.0s)]
*  I think with Santos, at least the Republicans in New York can now go home and say they tried. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=223.0s)]
*  I mean, this was always going to be a long shot for them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=229.0s)]
*  We watched the fact that even more than 30 Democrats voted not to expel Santos. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=232.0s)]
*  Only 20 some odd Republicans did vote to expel him among them, those key five New York Republican lawmakers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=238.0s)]
*  That's important to their reelection battles. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=245.0s)]
*  I think you're right to point all of that out because the politics is so inextricably linked with the personnel decisions that are being made in this building right now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=247.0s)]
*  And I think that for Santos, the reason Republicans have slow-walked this for so long is because their majority is already razor thin. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=257.0s)]
*  It would be like going from a three-blade razor to a two-blade razor, and they need all of the shave that they can get. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=265.0s)]
*  So this is not something they're willing to go along with easily. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=271.0s)]
*  It's why we've seen even just in the last few minutes, Speaker Johnson walked by me just two minutes before I came on the air with you, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=274.0s)]
*  and I asked him if Santos should be expelled, and he sort of shook his head and laughed at me for even asking the question. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=280.0s)]
*  That's the way that most leadership have dealt with this, from McCarthy through Johnson now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=288.0s)]
*  I don't mean to be overly cynical here, but it just seems transparent to me what happened, which is that Johnson got unanimity from the caucus. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=294.0s)]
*  Everyone in the Republican Party voted for him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=303.0s)]
*  There are five members in New York who have a real uphill battle. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=305.0s)]
*  A bunch of them voted for Jordan. They just voted for Mike Johnson. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=309.0s)]
*  They have to come back to their district and say something about why they are not, like the rest of those other Republicans you may not like, district that went plus Biden plus eight. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=312.0s)]
*  And this was engineered essentially to give those gentlemen cover. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=324.0s)]
*  I think that that's one way of looking at it, and I think that that's probably the right way of looking at it, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=330.0s)]
*  because this is all about getting political cover to make sure that the majority can A, be maintained in the short term. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=335.0s)]
*  They don't want to get rid of them because there's a special election, and you've got to imagine those voters on Long Island are not going to be easily voting for another Republican again. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=341.0s)]
*  So Republicans would rather take the short-term pain and have the long-term gain of the one seat that's in their four- or five-seat majority as it exists already. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=351.0s)]
*  But yeah, for a lot of these folks, Mark Molinaro, for example, I'm from that area, that Hudson Valley area. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=360.0s)]
*  I'm technically, my parents are in the Lawler district now, but I know that area well. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=365.0s)]
*  The fact that Molinaro voted for Jim Jordan twice and then went along with the rest of his conference and voted for Johnson is definitely something that voters at home are going to have questions about. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=370.0s)]
*  The election denial is central to those questions, but certainly that's what this Republican majority has said they're fine with. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=380.0s)]
*  And I think that you sort of have to take them at face value on that, that that is a feature, not a bug of this conference. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=387.0s)]
*  Mike Pence announced that he is dropping out of the 2024 Republican primary over the weekend. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=393.0s)]
*  Usually that surprise announcement, I mean, he sort of sprung it on people, would have been huge news. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=399.0s)]
*  There just has not been that much national interest in that primary contest, and that's because Donald Trump currently holds an enormous, dramatically in the polls. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=404.0s)]
*  He is the big red line at the top. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=413.0s)]
*  His second closest opponent, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Greenline, finds his lead getting smaller and smaller. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=415.0s)]
*  And this failure to gain any momentum has caused some problems for the candidate that some in the past have called short Trump. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=421.0s)]
*  That attention is where all the attention on Ron DeSantis has been lately, not on his positions, but on the interesting boots he's been awkwardly strutting around in. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=428.0s)]
*  The Internet has become obsessed with these mystery boots and the theory they might contain lifts in the heel to make Ron look taller. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=437.0s)]
*  Shoe experts have weighed in on the weirdly long sideshow Bob style toe box situation that maybe is because there aren't any toes in there. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=443.0s)]
*  Maybe because the foot is back up on a stilt in the back like stiletto high heels inside his manly man cowboy boots. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=451.0s)]
*  It's all speculation, of course, not the type of thing anyone is seriously focused on. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=458.0s)]
*  What they're trying to say with this is that in your boots you have heels. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=465.0s)]
*  No, no, no. Those are just standard off the rack. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=469.0s)]
*  Lucchese. How tall are you? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=473.0s)]
*  How tall are you, Governor? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=476.0s)]
*  Five-eleven. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=477.0s)]
*  Five-eleven. Okay. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=478.0s)]
*  Why don't you wear tennis shoes and dress shoes? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=479.0s)]
*  I do wear tennis shoes when I work out. Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=482.0s)]
*  You do? Okay. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=485.0s)]
*  I got a gift for you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=486.0s)]
*  I'd love for you to wear. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=487.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=488.0s)]
*  I shop at Fergamo. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=489.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=491.0s)]
*  I don't accept gifts. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=492.0s)]
*  I can't accept it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=497.0s)]
*  I totally get it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=498.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=499.0s)]
*  Do you think Ron DeSantis thought that was going to be his fate when he got into this race, when he was the world beater, when he had just romped to reelection, when he was the guy he was going to take on Trump? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=500.0s)]
*  Do you think that's where he thought he'd be ended up in that guy's podcast getting Ferragamo's? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=512.0s)]
*  To add injury to insult, a new poll from NBC News and the Duwayne literature shows DeSantis now tied with a rising Nikki Haley. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=516.0s)]
*  Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist for the New York Times. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=524.0s)]
*  Tim Miller was communications director for the Jeb Bush 2016 campaign. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=527.0s)]
*  Now, writer at large for the Bullwork. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=530.0s)]
*  Both join me now. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=532.0s)]
*  I, Tim, as a veteran of one of these primaries, I saw like, I think I'm not projecting, but like a flicker of like deep existential dread and despair flashing through Ron DeSantis' eyes as he finds himself on some dude's podcast talking about his shoes, like on the sort of like freak show fringes of a race that he was supposed to be at the center of. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=534.0s)]
*  Yeah, it kind of always looks like he's about to snap, to be honest. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=563.0s)]
*  It's kind of his face, which has been one of his problems in the primary. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=568.0s)]
*  But I also noticed some dread. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=572.0s)]
*  I do have to say I don't have a ton of sympathy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=573.0s)]
*  I really don't have any sympathy for somebody that signed up to be Ron DeSantis' communication director, my old job. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=576.0s)]
*  But I do have just a little bit of like professional empathy for the idea that had I put my candidate onto a podcast that was totally meaningless. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=581.0s)]
*  And then on the podcast, they got lectured about how they're supposedly wearing high heel shoes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=590.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have wanted to be in the car with the candidate after. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=595.0s)]
*  I would be taking an Uber home. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=598.0s)]
*  So that's pretty embarrassing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=600.0s)]
*  And I mean, I think this mostly just speaks to how relevant the campaign is. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=602.0s)]
*  And obviously, there are more serious issues. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=606.0s)]
*  The fact that he's out there saying that 11th graders can't talk about their gay family members, but he can wear high heels. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=608.0s)]
*  There seems to be some inconsistencies there. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=614.0s)]
*  I do think the former is probably more important. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=616.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think what is striking to me, I have the feeling now about this primary, which again, I guess I tried to keep myself with an open mind as we went into this, Jamel. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=618.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=627.0s)]
*  The future is unwritten. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=628.0s)]
*  I keep telling myself all the time, like I keep reminding myself of what I thought was going to be my year in February of 2020, which constantly keeps me honest about how much I can extrapolate the future from the past. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=629.0s)]
*  But what is your understanding of why we have ended up here in which possibly competitive primary has been this what you're seeing? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=641.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's it was not quite inevitable, but close to inevitable as soon as the Republican Party collectively decided in February of 2021 that Trump could just skate past January 6. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=652.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=668.0s)]
*  Yeah, no one was really going to contest that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=669.0s)]
*  That as soon as that decision was made first Trump's narrative of the election, cement and stone. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=672.0s)]
*  I did not lose. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=679.0s)]
*  It was illegitimate. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=681.0s)]
*  I actually am the victor. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=682.0s)]
*  Every other Republican has to defer to that narrative. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=684.0s)]
*  You'll remember last year when Ron the Sandus seemed like he was riding high. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=688.0s)]
*  He wouldn't even really challenge that at all, right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=691.0s)]
*  No one would really challenge that narrative whatsoever. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=694.0s)]
*  This unchallengeable narrative about how Trump actually won the election and Trump is running again. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=697.0s)]
*  So it's like, of course, he's going to be ahead because he's still be uncontested leader of the Republican Party. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=704.0s)]
*  There's no one willing to say, you know, in the presidential field, this guy actually lost. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=711.0s)]
*  He's a huge loser. We're not going to go with him. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=716.0s)]
*  And then all the other candidates, rather than trying to distinguish themselves in a meaningful way from Trump, are all pitching themselves for the most part. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=720.0s)]
*  This is variations on the feet. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=728.0s)]
*  I'm like Trump, but I'm like more competent. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=730.0s)]
*  I'm like Trump, but I'm like, you know, 37 year old Marty Winn kid. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=733.0s)]
*  Like, you know, just various variations on who Donald Trump is. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=737.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=741.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=747.0s)]
*  Together, my expectation really has been, of course, Trump is going to be the nominee. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=748.0s)]
*  Like, there's no there's no way in which it's shaping out that it would be anything else. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=752.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that, you know, that point about that, that was a decisive moment, Tim, that the sort of that narrative about the loss, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=758.0s)]
*  For a bunch of different reasons in terms of the political expediency of like, you're a loser who lost. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=765.0s)]
*  Like, generally, parties don't like take the guy that just lost the election and then be like, yes, you are our path to victory. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=770.0s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=777.0s)]
*  There's also just the sort of moral consequences of that as well. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=778.0s)]
*  But I think you see that in the Mike Pence, you know, you know, if the idea was Trump ism without January 6th, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=781.0s)]
*  Like, there's a plausible case for Mike Pence, who was like there as a loyal soldier every step of the way, but for the coup. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=791.0s)]
*  And the fact that he can't even make it into Iowa says something about how doomed that is. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=797.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=802.0s)]
*  I almost entirely agree with Jamal. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=804.0s)]
*  It was made one slight exception, but that was the moment in February. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=806.0s)]
*  Not only politically, but the narrative that he said it, but also practically, you know, there are senators in this race, right? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=810.0s)]
*  That could have voted to convict him and would have and that would have eliminated their top competitor. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=815.0s)]
*  Generally speaking, if you're a guy like Tim Scott, if you're running a serious race and you're at the bottom and you have a chance to cast a vote that could eliminate your top competitor, that would have seemed like a good idea morally and strategically. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=820.0s)]
*  But they all didn't do that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=830.0s)]
*  So that was part of it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=831.0s)]
*  And I do think that there was maybe a second window after the midterms when DeSantis could have made this case really strongly. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=833.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=840.0s)]
*  And I do. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=841.0s)]
*  And you saw in the polls the numbers were there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=842.0s)]
*  This guy's a loser. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=843.0s)]
*  We saw it again. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=844.0s)]
*  We tried again. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=845.0s)]
*  I think there's one more window after in November 22. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=846.0s)]
*  As for Pence, just really quick, him and Mike Johnson is the best example of this. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=849.0s)]
*  And these are the two same, they literally the same guys at the same positions. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=853.0s)]
*  They're both religious conservatives. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=856.0s)]
*  They're both named Mike. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=857.0s)]
*  One of them becomes a speaker. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=858.0s)]
*  The other drops out. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=860.0s)]
*  The only difference between them is January 6th. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=861.0s)]
*  And that shows you how January 6th is so central to the Republican psyche. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=863.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=867.0s)]
*  And in the end, I think also, I mean, there's going to have to be, Jamel, I think the other thing driving this is that people think that Trump is a possible contender to be president. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=868.0s)]
*  And the polling backs him up. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=878.0s)]
*  I do think everyone has forgotten a little bit of what a trial, national trial is going to mean the politics of. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=879.0s)]
*  And I continue to think that's underpriced. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=888.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=890.0s)]
*  I think that's probably right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=892.0s)]
*  Like a unprecedented trial of a president during a former president, sorry, during an election year. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=894.0s)]
*  Seems like the kind of thing that's going to be consequential, especially since what we know about Trump is that it's whenever he is really in the public eye, whenever he's actually loud and present, that people don't want anything to do with him. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=900.0s)]
*  Notably right now, he's sort of faded to the background. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=913.0s)]
*  And when he fades to the background and you see him, you see this in his polling during his presidency, when he fades to the background, people become a little more tolerant of him. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=916.0s)]
*  So we'll have to see how it will look when he's back in the foreground. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=923.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=927.0s)]
*  Jamel Bowie and Tim Miller, great to have you both. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=928.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eLGrcsFCY&t=930.0s)]
