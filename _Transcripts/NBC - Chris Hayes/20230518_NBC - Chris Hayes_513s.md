# Bowman calls out MTG for racist tropes after she says she 'feels threated’ by him
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834)
*  We're accepting them. We love them. We love the migrant children. We lost them. You can't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=0.0s)]
*  find them. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? No, no, we don't know [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=10.4s)]
*  the news. I don't know. That's Fox News. That's Fox News. Listen, I need you to save the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=16.4s)]
*  party. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=21.0s)]
*  Yelling, shouting, raising his voice. He has aggressive, his physical mannerisms are aggressive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=22.0s)]
*  And I am concerned about it. I feel threatened by him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=29.64s)]
*  Jevon Bogan is here with me now to respond to those accusations from Congressman Marjorie [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=32.72s)]
*  Taylor Greene. He has been menacing me during the entire commercial break. I should note [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=38.0s)]
*  that my full disclosure, my brother worked for you. He no longer does. But I, I, I, well, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=42.44s)]
*  what do you want to say to that? Oh my goodness. I mean, it's, it's so nonsensical that it's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=48.24s)]
*  comical. You can see clearly in the video that we were like playfully jousting with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=53.88s)]
*  each other. She was laughing. I was laughing. We were talking about each other's party and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=59.32s)]
*  certain issues. So the demeanor and the disposition, you know, on the steps, it was, it was, it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=64.24s)]
*  was playful. We were, we were going after each other. So for her the next morning to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  say what she said, I mean, it's a complete 180 number one. It's no longer comical now [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=74.08s)]
*  because now you are using historical racist tropes toward black men, menacing his mannerisms. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=79.76s)]
*  I'm afraid that's the stuff that got, you know, Trayvon Martin killed, Tamir Rice killed, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=89.04s)]
*  Michael Brown killed. I mean, I believe officer Darren Smith literally talked about his [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=97.0s)]
*  presence and his strength as an excuse for killing him. And this has happened to black [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=101.64s)]
*  men historically. And so now we're in a dangerous space. And that's why I wanted to be really, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  really clear to reporters today how reckless and dangerous her statements were. And she [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=111.48s)]
*  should know better. I believe she knows better. This is another reason why we need to teach the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=117.84s)]
*  accurate history of America in our schools and make sure African-American history is a part of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  that because her rhetoric and her behavior in Congress outside of me, pictures with the AR-15 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=128.16s)]
*  with the squad behind her chasing David Hogg and stalking him as he engaged in activism around [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=135.28s)]
*  gun violence. Her rhetoric, her language, her behavior has been aggressive and intimidating [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=143.44s)]
*  since she's gotten into Congress. Now she's trying to displace it onto me. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=148.72s)]
*  I want to say also that if this gesture, which you were doing is aggressive, then all of my [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=152.96s)]
*  paisans are in trouble. That's New York City right there. But that is New York City. I mean, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=159.28s)]
*  the other thing to get to your serious point, I don't want to, I mean, what I thought was, well, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=165.2s)]
*  if she had said this without the video, like we had the video, right? So you could look at the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=171.84s)]
*  video, it's like, this is ridiculous. But when someone's just like, this black man is intimidating [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=176.72s)]
*  and physically aggressive. I mean, yeah, that's a serious thing to say in the society in which we [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=182.16s)]
*  live and have lived for a long time. Yeah. And could have real consequences. Again, throughout [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=187.84s)]
*  American history and not just about black men, but women of color as well. And, you know, when I first [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=192.16s)]
*  got to Congress and I had my first conversation with the squad, remember they were coming off of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=197.92s)]
*  Donald Trump. They would talk about the number of death threats they would receive after Trump would [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=202.16s)]
*  say something about them. Send them back or something like that. Rise in death threats, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  have to increase security. So this is dangerous territory. We're walking in here. We got to be [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  very clear about that. And we need her to say on the record, one, she should apologize to me on the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=218.32s)]
*  record. Two, ask her directly, do you want physical violence to be inflicted upon Congressman [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=223.84s)]
*  Bowman? And let her answer that question. Because at the end of her statement, it was, we need to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=230.8s)]
*  watch him. That's almost like Donald Trump, you know, stand by and stand back to the proud boys [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=236.4s)]
*  in that debate a couple of years ago. We need to watch him. What are you saying? It's just, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=243.52s)]
*  it's crazy. And again, this is why we have to teach history accurately so we can all be more [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=249.92s)]
*  enlightened as we govern. I want to ask you about, you know, we played the tape of you and Thomas [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  Massey and you had that exchange. Oh, yeah. She said I shoved him, which I didn't show. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=259.2s)]
*  Clearly you didn't. Yes, it would be news if Congressman Jamal Bowman shoved Thomas Massey. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=263.28s)]
*  I saw that in the tape. I thought, wait a second. No. What's the deal with these interactions? Like, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=269.2s)]
*  is this a thing you're doing now? Is it just in the moment? Are you like, I am doing this as a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=276.32s)]
*  tactical thing or I can't help myself? You know what it is? It's literally, it's organic. It just [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=283.28s)]
*  happens. So the Massey thing, I wasn't yelling at him. I was yelling at journalists to ask [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=290.64s)]
*  Republicans about confounds and do more. Correct. He walked up. And then he walked up and then that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=295.52s)]
*  became a thing. With Byron Donalds, we usually like talk about sports as we walk down the steps. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=299.12s)]
*  I saw them approach him to ask him about the Santas. So I started like going at him like, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=304.88s)]
*  yeah, I want to hear what you have to say. It's really just who I am in terms of how I talk to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=309.6s)]
*  people on a consistent basis. So it's not really a thing that's become a thing. And I get a lot of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=315.04s)]
*  questions, this confrontational style. And I'm like, I don't mean to be that way. However, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=321.44s)]
*  I am extremely frustrated consistently by the lack of action in Congress and how everyone is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  all about decorum and kids are dying every day from gun violence and one in five children go to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  bed hungry. And we have all of these issues and we don't have the sense of urgency to do something [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  about it. And people in our districts want us to do something about it. So it's authentically me, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  but at the same time, it's like, okay, this place, this place is obtuse. It takes way too [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=352.08s)]
*  long to do anything. And I'm not a lifelong politician or lawyer or business person. I'm [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=357.84s)]
*  not rich. I'm an educator. So I'm coming in with that energy and hopefully we can get stuff done. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=362.96s)]
*  Let me ask you a follow up on that gun violence question because this is something that I'm [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  obsessed with at this point. If you talk about violent crime, right, then the right will talk [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=373.2s)]
*  about violent crime all the time. And they want to run ads and Democrats like you and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=378.8s)]
*  lives are soft and violent crime. The second you call it gun violence, which is the most serious [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=383.44s)]
*  violent crime we have the U S unquestionably, it's the most dangerous one or violent crime. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=388.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, like the political valence gets flipped and it's like, well, there's really nothing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=391.44s)]
*  we can do about gun violence, violent crime. We got cops, all this stuff, gun violence, you know, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=394.88s)]
*  what's going to happen. It's so strange to me how much it's the same thing. Like it is the same [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=400.72s)]
*  thing. Like America has too much gun violence. It has too much violence. It has too many homicides. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=406.64s)]
*  Too many people die from this. We need to bring that number down. That's right. Yeah. I mean, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=411.12s)]
*  but it's been totally different ways. It's, it's, it's bizarre and it's why Congress is often like [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=416.8s)]
*  upside down world and Republicans will say these things. Many of the many of supporters support [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=424.24s)]
*  what they say. Many of their support support what they say. And what I want for our party to do is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=430.64s)]
*  push back and take back the narrative and be very clear on what we're talking about. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=435.2s)]
*  Do not acquiesce or, or, or seed ground to their talking points because we feel we need to be [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=440.08s)]
*  tougher on crime. Talk about public safety. Yeah. Talk about public health. I mean, you talk about [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=446.88s)]
*  poverty. You're a principal. I saw kids coming to school every day, hungry, stressed, frustrated, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=452.56s)]
*  living in public housing and we stop invested in, of course, those kids are more likely to get in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=458.0s)]
*  trouble in school because we're not meeting their basic needs. So I want our party to like talk [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=462.88s)]
*  about that and take back the narrative when it comes to that. And they have no moral ground to [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=468.88s)]
*  stand on, on that issue. Well, at all. And that's why we got to use it to win big in 2024, not just [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=473.36s)]
*  in the house, but the Senate, man, for sure. Yeah. And there's a bunch of New York reps that are [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=479.6s)]
*  going to be on the front lines of that. And maybe, who knows, maybe there'll be a George [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=484.56s)]
*  Santos vacancy as well. We'll see where that ends up. Congressman Jamal Bowman. Great to have you [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=487.36s)]
*  here. Thank you. Good to see you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAvG_Zr1834&t=491.2s)]
