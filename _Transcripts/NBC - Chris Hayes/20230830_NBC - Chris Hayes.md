Video Description: “The strategy is literally to just actively hurl ourselves into the fire. Let a thousand hurricanes bloom. It is deranged—but it is the consensus view of the Republican Party,” says Chris Hayes on “Project 2025,” the right-wing think tank plan to gut climate policy.

# Hayes blasts ‘deranged’ GOP climate plan ‘Hurl ourselves into the fire’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg)
*  You don't have to be a climate scientist to understand what's happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, the basic mechanics here are incredibly simple, incredibly straightforward. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=4.0s)]
*  As we burn fossil fuels, we pump more and more carbon into the atmosphere. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=10.0s)]
*  The carbon causes atmosphere to trap more heat from the sun, warming the planet and warming the oceans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=14.0s)]
*  Those warmer oceans hold more energy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=19.0s)]
*  There's more energy in there, and that energy fuels storms that get stronger faster. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=22.0s)]
*  In fact, the extra heat increases the likelihood and severity of all kinds of extreme weather events in all kinds of places. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=27.0s)]
*  Now, before all this, hundreds of years ago, the pre-industrial age, Florida was already uniquely exposed to extreme weather. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=33.0s)]
*  It is a peninsula jutting out into warm waters directly in the path of hurricanes that form every year. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=42.0s)]
*  Now, as the threat of severe weather increases, so, of course, does the threat of harm to this beautiful place that millions of people call home. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=48.0s)]
*  In the extreme weather aside, Florida is a lovely place to be. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=56.0s)]
*  Not only that, it's a marvel of human engineering. I mean, truly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=60.0s)]
*  150 years ago, much of Florida was an uninhabitable pestilential swamp. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=63.0s)]
*  We drained and developed millions of acres, turned Florida into literally Disney World. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=68.0s)]
*  A great civilizational achievement, man over nature. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=73.0s)]
*  It is right now at a great risk of being undone by the greatest civilizational threat we have ever faced. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=77.0s)]
*  Given all of that, you wouldn't think that the people who represent that uniquely precarious slice of land [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=84.0s)]
*  jutting out into the ocean in the path of increasingly severe storms would be fervently trying to mitigate the risk, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=93.0s)]
*  reduce the enormous amounts of energy we are pumping into the atmosphere. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=99.0s)]
*  But the reality is literally the opposite. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=103.0s)]
*  Florida's Republican leaders are actually trying to make it worse actively. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=107.0s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis is refusing to accept $350 million in energy efficiency incentives [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=112.0s)]
*  that Florida is eligible for under the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=119.0s)]
*  He's just saying, burn it, no thanks, to hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=122.0s)]
*  And this is not like for some weird experimental, like liberal cause. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=125.0s)]
*  It would just help people retrofit their homes with energy efficient appliances, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=130.0s)]
*  which is a very simple, straightforward way to help tackle carbon emissions and climate change. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=134.0s)]
*  The rejection is just insane nihilism. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=139.0s)]
*  On one level, it's hard to even believe it, that he's doing this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=142.0s)]
*  But of course, you know, Ron DeSantis also turned against the code vaccines, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=145.0s)]
*  which is an equally obvious benefit for his constituents. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=149.0s)]
*  My God, it is so rare in life and in policy that you just are handed something so simple that provides so much benefit, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=152.0s)]
*  like the vaccines, and Ron DeSantis just turned on it for political expedience. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=159.0s)]
*  I mean, his position on climate change is essentially vaccine denialism at civilizational scale. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=165.0s)]
*  To Ron DeSantis, this existential threat to the peninsula he represents is just another political debate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=171.0s)]
*  What I found is people, when they start talking about things like global warming, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=178.0s)]
*  they typically use that as a pretext to do a bunch of left-wing things that they would want to do anyways. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=183.0s)]
*  And so we're not doing any left-wing stuff. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=188.0s)]
*  Cool, okay. Don't do any left-wing stuff. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=191.0s)]
*  It's not just Ron DeSantis, too. He's not an outlier. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=194.0s)]
*  It's the whole Republican Party, the one-half of the two viable major parties. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=198.0s)]
*  The conservative strategy put together by the Heritage Foundation, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=203.0s)]
*  they're calling it the Project 2025 for like governing in 2025 if the Republican wins, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=206.0s)]
*  calls for shredding regulations to curb greenhouse gas pollution from cars, oil and gas wells, and power plants, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=212.0s)]
*  dismantling almost every clean energy program in the federal government [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=218.0s)]
*  and boosting the production of fossil fuels. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=222.0s)]
*  I mean, that's not even like turning against the vaccine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=225.0s)]
*  That's like saying you're going to give everyone COVID, like door to door, coughing on people. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=228.0s)]
*  That's where we are. They are not in the realm of reasonable policy debate. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=235.0s)]
*  This is not a difference of opinion on how quickly or how best to meet the targets on curbing emissions or the trade-offs we may face. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=240.0s)]
*  The strategy is literally to just actively hurl ourselves into the fire, let a thousand hurricanes bloom. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=247.0s)]
*  It is deranged. It is almost hard to understand what it is, that it is the reality, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=257.0s)]
*  but it is the consensus view of the Republican Party, whose nominee will have the 50-50 chance of winning the presidency next year. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=263.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmWApK3-pUg&t=276.0s)]
