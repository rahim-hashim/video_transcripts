# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 30
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, we may be on the precipice of the end [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=0.0s)]
*  of the congressional career of one George Santos. Tomorrow, the New York Republican [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=4.5s)]
*  will face his third expulsion vote on the floor in less than a year in office. Has to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=8.72s)]
*  be some kind of record. There have been some key developments though since the last vote [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=13.86s)]
*  failed the beginning of this month. Remember, it's a two thirds vote. The House Ethics Committee [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=18.04s)]
*  released a scathing report finding quote, substantial evidence that Santos broke federal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=22.54s)]
*  law, defrauding his own donors and then using their campaign contributions to personally [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=27.22s)]
*  enrich himself. The report alleges that Santos spent that money on resort stays, luxury goods, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=32.26s)]
*  Botox and the adult website OnlyFans. Now that comes in addition to the 23 count federal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=37.7s)]
*  indictment filed against the congressman in October that charges him with conspiracy, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=44.14s)]
*  wire fraud, making false statements, falsifying records, identity theft, credit card fraud, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=48.54s)]
*  money laundering and theft of public funds. And even beyond all that, which is a lot, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=54.1s)]
*  George Santos is just an enormous embarrassment to his party and to the institution of Congress. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=60.22s)]
*  As he walks the halls of Congress, people cringe. He's a ludicrous figure wrapped up [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=66.94s)]
*  in a web of ridiculous scandals and lies. A local news website is reporting a disabled [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=71.92s)]
*  veteran is calling out Congressman George Santos, claiming the lawmaker scammed him out of $3,000 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=79.3s)]
*  for his dying dog's life saving surgery. Baruch College, NYU, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=87.34s)]
*  tell NBC News they have no record of Santos despite being listed on his campaign biography. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  George Santos didn't even go to Baruch College. So by extension, George Santos did not play for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=99.14s)]
*  Baruch's championship volleyball team. Nor did George Santos get to knee replacements because of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=104.98s)]
*  his vaunted volleyball career playing there. I've always joked with friends in circles, even with in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=111.5s)]
*  the campaign, I'd say, guys, I'm Jewish. Remember, I was raised Catholic. And there is simply no [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=118.62s)]
*  evidence that your mother ever worked at the World Trade Center at all. Did you know that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=122.94s)]
*  Congressman George Santos also claims he was the target of an assassination attempt, which [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=128.26s)]
*  required him being put under official police protection. Bloomberg reported that George Santos [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=133.94s)]
*  bragged to donors in 2021 that he was a producer on the infamous Spider-Man Broadway musical. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=139.26s)]
*  Indicted Republican Congressman George Santos was seen leaving a colleague's office carrying a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=146.66s)]
*  mysterious baby. And when he was asked if the baby was his, he replied, not yet. Okay, now there's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=152.38s)]
*  obviously a lot of evidence to suggest that George Santos probably shouldn't be a member of the United [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=161.54s)]
*  States Congress. But the biggest reason that he is facing a real threat of expulsion tomorrow on the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  third try is because it is politically expedient for a certain wing of the Republican Party, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=171.94s)]
*  particularly the House caucus. There are five members from New York in the House Republican [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=177.06s)]
*  caucus who want to keep their seats in districts Joe Biden won, despite the fact that they're all, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=182.5s)]
*  down the line Republicans. And it would be a good idea for them, for all the Republicans in moderate [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=187.62s)]
*  districts, to distance themselves from Santos. It's a show of independence from the Republican [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=192.34s)]
*  Party line by voting to get rid of him, but it doesn't cost them anything. They're not voting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  against any priorities. It doesn't cross Donald Trump. So it's an easy win. And it's important to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  remember that George Santos is a member of Congress because of Donald Trump. Full stop. End the Trump [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=206.58s)]
*  base. He had nothing to do with politics before becoming a diehard Trump fan. He founded a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=212.66000000000003s)]
*  grassroots group supporting then president's reelection campaign. And after both Trump and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=217.46s)]
*  Santos lost their 2020 races, Santos actually ran the first time in 2020, Santos claimed the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=222.18s)]
*  elections were stolen and he attended Trump's speech on the morning of January 6th. And then [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=227.3s)]
*  he rode the MAGA train to victory last year unopposed to Republican nomination. He's a Trump guy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  And of course, all of the qualities that make that guy, George Santos, so embarrassing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=237.7s)]
*  are the same ones exhibited by the likely Republican presidential nominee, the leader [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=243.22s)]
*  of the Republican Party, Donald Trump. The constant compulsive lying, the pathological [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=248.26s)]
*  need for attention, no matter how negative the total disregard for the rule of law. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=254.42s)]
*  But Santos is just one particularly colorful side of the MAGA coin. Last night I spoke to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=259.86s)]
*  Democratic Congressman, Jamie Raskin, who told me he would vote to expel Santos this time after [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=265.54s)]
*  previously voting no and made an important point about how Santos compares to the MAGA king and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  his most ardent defenders. The logic for my vote last time was simply this. We don't want to set [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=276.1s)]
*  a precedent where people are being expelled without either a criminal conviction in, you know, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=282.5s)]
*  federal or state court or else an ethics finding that they've engaged in serious misconduct that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=289.38s)]
*  we can judge once we're able to read the report. You know, the only argument I could torture out [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  for him now is that all of the lies he told, which he certainly did tell and the evidence is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  overwhelming, do not add up to Donald Trump's big lie, which still a majority of the Republican [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=308.18s)]
*  caucus stands by. It's a good point. I mean, 147 Republican members of Congress voted to overturn [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=314.1s)]
*  the 2020 election. Almost all of them are still in office. Some of the most active coup plotters, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=320.66s)]
*  people who labored intensely on behalf on the plot to end American constitutional governance, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=325.86s)]
*  a plot that is implicated now in two different sets of criminal charges to deny the people of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=330.66s)]
*  this country the right to choose their leader, the most fundamental one. Those people remain in that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  caucus, the people that plotted totally unscathed and in some ways more or less anonymous. You [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=341.22s)]
*  probably wouldn't even recognize them. Like this guy. I mean, we've talked about him before, but [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=345.3s)]
*  this is Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. By many accounts, he was one of the most central coup [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=350.42s)]
*  plotters in all of Congress. It was Perry that introduced Donald Trump to Jeffrey Clark. That's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=355.86s)]
*  the low level official at the Department of Justice who was supportive of Trump's claim. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=361.86s)]
*  The election was stolen. The January 6th committee revealed that Perry even brought Clark to the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=366.02s)]
*  White House to meet Trump in late December 2020. Trump then considered firing the acting attorney [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=371.3s)]
*  general, Jeff Rosen, and replacing him with Clark in order to use the Department of Justice to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=376.5s)]
*  steal the election. This was a Perry Trump-Clark plot. Perry was a focus of the January 6th [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=380.82s)]
*  committee's investigation, receiving a subpoena that he just flat out ignored. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=387.22s)]
*  Last summer, the FBI seized Perry's phone, and special counsel Jack Smith has also sought [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=391.22s)]
*  information from Perry since he took over the federal investigation. Now, a new court filing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  in that case has revealed a slew of damning text messages that Congressman Perry sent to Jeffrey [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  Clark and many others in the Trump orbit in the wake of the 2020 election. In the midst of the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=407.70000000000005s)]
*  effort to elevate Clark to top role of DOJ, right, where he could send out that letter saying, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=413.06s)]
*  the Department of Justice doesn't know if the ballots are legit, right? Perry texted him, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=417.7s)]
*  quote, you are the man. I have confirmed it. God does what he does for a reason. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  Between the end of December and January 5th, 2021, Congressman Perry also texted a former DOJ [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  colleague and embraced a plan to have then Vice President Mike Pence, quote, admit testimony [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=433.22s)]
*  prior to the counting of the electoral votes on the 6th. Perry agreed to sell the idea with a call [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=439.14s)]
*  to Trump, Pence and Trump advisor, John Eastman. But Perry later alerted him that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=443.94s)]
*  Pence's chief of staff, Mark Short, will not allow access. Yeah, I'll bet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=448.5s)]
*  Yet that guy, Scott Perry, the coup plotter remains a member of Congress in good standing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=454.02s)]
*  In fact, tomorrow he's going to stand inside the well of the house and vote on whether to expel [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=459.14s)]
*  George Santos from that body. We are following some breaking news this hour, a truly remarkable [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=465.86s)]
*  report out of the New York Times about the extent to which Israel was warned about Hamas's intentions [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=474.42s)]
*  to start a war ahead of the deadly October 7th attacks. Quote, Israeli officials obtained Hamas's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=480.18s)]
*  battle plan for the October 7th terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=486.82s)]
*  emails and interviews show. But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=493.22s)]
*  aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out. The approximately 40 page [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  document, which the Israeli authorities codenamed Jericho Wall, outlined point by point exactly the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=505.46000000000004s)]
*  kind of devastating invasion that led to the deaths of about 1200 people. According to one [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=511.70000000000005s)]
*  intelligence analyst in Israel, this was not merely a plan for an attack, quote, it is a plan [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=517.5400000000001s)]
*  designed to start a war. Ben Rhodes served as deputy national security advisor to President [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=522.34s)]
*  Barack Obama and he joins me now. Ben, this just published before it went to air, so I just want [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=527.7800000000001s)]
*  to sort of set the table for folks. I mean, it's not just that there's a battle plan, it is the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=532.6600000000001s)]
*  battle plan. It involves things like paragliders going over the fence. It involves machine guns [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  and drones to take out security cameras. It involves initiating with a barrage of rockets, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  motorcycles going over the fence. I mean, it's literally the plan. And they had it inside the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=549.78s)]
*  Israeli intelligence apparatus. As someone who works in the United States in security apparatus, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=556.98s)]
*  what is your reaction to this? I mean, it's absolutely astonishing, Chris, because to your [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=563.14s)]
*  point, sometimes you have warning that something might happen, but very rarely, if ever, do you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=568.98s)]
*  have this level of specificity. I mean, before I was in the Obama administration, I worked [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=574.34s)]
*  for the vice chair of the 9-11 Commission on the 9-11 Commission. And this would be analogous to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=579.38s)]
*  the U.S. government having had information that, you know, Al Qaeda was planning to [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  try to fly planes into these targets from these airports and had people in flight schools. I mean, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  this is a level of specificity that intelligence almost never gets. And that's what is so [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=594.98s)]
*  astonishing about this reporting. It wasn't just like a concern that Hamas might be up to something. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=602.18s)]
*  They might be trying to plan something big. You usually get those types of warnings, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=607.2199999999999s)]
*  reflections and conversations or intercepted communications. This was the literal plan of [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=611.3s)]
*  what they actually ended up doing on October 7th within the Israeli system for a full year. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=616.8199999999999s)]
*  That is something that is an intelligence and policy failure that goes beyond anything that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=623.38s)]
*  I can think of, frankly. Yeah, I was trying to search for something, some analog or precedent, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=628.34s)]
*  and was coming up NP as well. Then there's another additional aspect to this that in some ways is [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=634.5s)]
*  even more damning, which is that at least one analyst in a unit in the Israeli intelligence [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=639.3000000000001s)]
*  system basically watched or saw that there was a rehearsal about six weeks before the attack [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=644.34s)]
*  and once again basically went to a superior and said, it looks like they're rehearsing the plan [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=650.6600000000001s)]
*  that we have, Jericho Wall, and was again, according to the reporting we have in the New [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=658.9s)]
*  York Times, encrypted emails they've obtained basically told, don't worry about it. Yeah, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=664.26s)]
*  so seeing the rehearsal and the thing to bear in mind, Chris, and we don't know yet how far up, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=672.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there are questions that remain. The questions that I would have are, was this plan [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=676.66s)]
*  briefed to Prime Minister Netanyahu or people who are government ministers? How high up did this go [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=681.54s)]
*  in the system? I'd be surprised, it'd be weird if something of this scale wasn't, but that'd be its [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=686.66s)]
*  own version of a failure. The thing that people have to bear in mind here is that not only was [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=692.26s)]
*  there not an action taken to disrupt this, but in fact, on October 7th, what had happened is the IDF [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=696.18s)]
*  that would normally be at that border had been redirected up to the West Bank because they were [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=703.4599999999999s)]
*  busy protecting settlers, Israeli settlers who were engaging, often initiating clashes with [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=709.38s)]
*  Palestinians. So actually the border wasn't even at the normal status quo of security, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=714.58s)]
*  it was less. And that's the policy failure to redirect those resources up to the West Bank. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  You would think that if you had this kind of planning and you were seeing this kind of activity [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  by Hamas, that we have reporting of additional warnings from Egypt and other places about this [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=728.98s)]
*  potentially. So you would think that you would be trying to do everything you could to fortify that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=735.14s)]
*  border and at least hedge against the fact that this plan might go forward, if not try to actively [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=739.46s)]
*  disrupt it. None of that happened. Yeah, as we dealt with the aftermath of October 7th, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=744.34s)]
*  and I think as Americans tried to figure out a way to understand it, the 9-11 has stood out [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=752.34s)]
*  as a touchstone or an American domestic experience. And one of the ways that the reaction [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=760.4200000000001s)]
*  in the politics of Israel has been different than the US is that there's been a huge rallying around [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=767.14s)]
*  the IDF and the war effort among Israeli politics and in public opinion, but not around Benjamin [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=773.06s)]
*  Netanyahu, who has incredibly low approval ratings, who in the most recent polling I saw today was [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=778.58s)]
*  only drawing 23 or 24% of the vote. And you really got to wonder what this does to an already [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=783.22s)]
*  extremely tenuous political position in a situation in which Netanyahu, it is understood, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=789.06s)]
*  is going to face the music when the war ends, but also has every political incentive imaginable to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=794.58s)]
*  extend the war as far as possible precisely because of this consensus view held across the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=800.66s)]
*  ideological spectrum in Israel that he will face the music when the war ends. That's right, Chris. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=806.18s)]
*  Netanyahu had been a political survivor for a long time. He'd become less popular because of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=812.1s)]
*  corruption investigations, certainly because of the kind of judicial coup that he was engaged in. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=816.8199999999999s)]
*  There were huge street protests, remember, against Netanyahu before October 7th. The one thing he had [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=821.3s)]
*  is that his nickname, his self-given nickname, was, I'm Mr. Security. You may not like certain [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=826.66s)]
*  things about me. You may not like some of my coalition, but I keep Israel safe. And that was [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=831.78s)]
*  shattered, obviously, on October 7th. And with each of these reports about the kind of incompetence [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=836.5s)]
*  or failure to protect that come out, that political standing suffers even more. I think, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=841.6999999999999s)]
*  frankly, what is worrying is precisely because he's in such a weak political position, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=848.26s)]
*  the only thing that is keeping him in office is this kind of emergency unity war cabinet that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=854.26s)]
*  he is leading. But the problem with that, the challenge from that strategically and politically, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=859.6999999999999s)]
*  and I think from the United States perspective is, as you said, that gives him every incentive to try [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=864.42s)]
*  to perpetuate a war, because I think everybody in Israel that I talk to, most political analysts [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=870.42s)]
*  agree that when the music stops, he's going to be replaced. That's just the nature of Israeli [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=876.0999999999999s)]
*  politics right now. And that's an awkward position to be in, frankly. It's an uncomfortable [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=881.22s)]
*  position to be in. Particularly, you have a massive aid package working its way through the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=886.6600000000001s)]
*  U.S. Congress. You have huge international opinion inflamed against the scale of this [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=890.26s)]
*  Israeli military operation. You obviously have the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=894.1800000000001s)]
*  All these things are happening. This report comes out. He's a very politically damaged leader. And [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=897.46s)]
*  the question is, does he need to be replaced now? Can we really, can Israel afford to wait for some [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=902.4200000000001s)]
*  end of this military operation that has a kind of open-ended duration to it? Netanyahu himself [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=908.58s)]
*  has said we may have to have an open-ended administration of Gaza, which might suggest [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=912.5s)]
*  that there's not necessarily going to be a clear end date to this war from his perspective. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=917.86s)]
*  Yeah, all of that is, I think, really, really well said and one of the main contextual issues here. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=922.4200000000001s)]
*  To go back to your experience, and one of the things I thought about this, again, I think from [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=928.6600000000001s)]
*  the first moment that the report started to come in of the scale of this attack, right, and how kind [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=932.9000000000001s)]
*  of famous in many ways the Israeli intelligence and security apparatus is. It's one of the most [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=938.8199999999999s)]
*  sophisticated in the entire world. It's known as such. This question of how did this happen [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=946.02s)]
*  has been there from the first day. And I also wondered, will there be some 9-11 commission? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=953.9399999999999s)]
*  Is there going to be some? And this makes, it just seems, you have to do, I mean, there's a lot of [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=960.9s)]
*  questions raised by this, like how far up did it go? Who's this colonel who said no? Why did people [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=965.86s)]
*  think they weren't going to do it? How far did they circulate the reports that they were rehearsing, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=970.02s)]
*  et cetera? No, that's right. I mean, Chris, my immediate reaction, right, on October 7th is how [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=974.42s)]
*  could this have happened? Because just to give you one example, Israel controls the entire internet [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=980.1s)]
*  and telecommunications infrastructure in Gaza. So sure, Hamas can try to communicate offline, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=984.98s)]
*  but the idea that you could plan something of this sophistication without it interacting with [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=991.3s)]
*  the telecommunications network, that Israel's visibility, and I just didn't get that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=996.18s)]
*  And part of what we're seeing now is actually they did have this information. And to your point, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=999.6999999999999s)]
*  I think in Israel, what they've said is, well, there'll have to be a commission of inquiry. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1003.4599999999999s)]
*  There'll have to be some look back at this. But again, like what politicians do, I think [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1007.38s)]
*  that now this approach has been that's for after the war. We have to wait until after the war to [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1011.8599999999999s)]
*  look back. We have to be focused on what we're doing in Gaza now. The problem with that is [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1016.26s)]
*  Israelis need to have confidence in their political leadership, in their military leadership, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1021.78s)]
*  in their intelligence community, the people that are carrying out the war, the people that are [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1027.3799999999999s)]
*  making hugely consequential decisions. And I don't know how you can have that confidence [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1031.3799999999999s)]
*  when there's reporting like this. This was, this has always been an issue in just understanding [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1036.5s)]
*  the sort of, you know, at the kind of ground level, the tactical response from Israel, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1041.86s)]
*  which was from one day to the next, you go from totally blind, apparently, right, to this horrific [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1048.34s)]
*  attack, you know, the most brutal and catastrophic in the country's history, I think, in many ways, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1054.8999999999999s)]
*  though they've suffered many attacks in Israel, to prosecuting a war that's going to depend on [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1061.3799999999999s)]
*  some intelligence, a lot of intelligence. Where are targets? Where are things? So it's all the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1067.54s)]
*  same apparatus. It's the same folks. It's the same units. It's the same kernels. It's all the same [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1072.74s)]
*  thing. And so, yeah, that question of how much faith people can have, and particularly the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1078.58s)]
*  Biden administration, the U.S. government, as it prepares this aid package, I think only gets more [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1084.82s)]
*  acute after this remarkable bombshell reporting from the New York Times published tonight. Ben [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1090.34s)]
*  Rhodes, always good to have you, sir. Thank you very much. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1095.3s)]
*  Still ahead, Donald Trump is gagged once more. What the latest ruling means for Trump, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1100.58s)]
*  and will he be able to follow the rules for once? Next. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1105.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqiaIHV9798&t=1125.3s)]
