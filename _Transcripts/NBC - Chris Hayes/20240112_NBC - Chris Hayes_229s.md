# ‘We want it back’: Raskin demands Trump repay $7.8M from foreign governments
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8)
*  If you have documented receipts of foreign governments writing checks or giving credit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=0.0s)]
*  card payments to Joe Biden, show it to us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  We've been at this for a year now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=9.92s)]
*  We haven't seen anything. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=11.84s)]
*  Then we show you in our more than 100 page report, the documented receipts of money going [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=13.34s)]
*  into Donald Trump, but you don't care about it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=18.36s)]
*  In other words, you don't care about the principle that our government leaders should not be [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=20.32s)]
*  on the take from foreign governments. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=24.96s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=26.84s)]
*  Amidst House Republicans' as yet utterly unproven and undemonstrated claims of President Joe [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=28.16s)]
*  Biden taking illicit funds, again, which they accuse he was doing not when he was president, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=33.64s)]
*  to be clear, Congressman Jimmy Raskin and other House Democrats issued a 100 page report [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=37.32s)]
*  showing that, quote, as president, Donald Trump accepted more than $7.8 million from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=41.24s)]
*  foreign states and their leaders, including some of the world's most unsavory regimes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=46.08s)]
*  Today, Raskin wrote a letter to Donald Trump himself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=50.8s)]
*  Please, sir, quote, immediately returned to the American people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=54.08s)]
*  The $7,886,072 we know you've accepted from foreign governments in violation of the U.S. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=57.24s)]
*  Constitution's foreign emoluments clause. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining me now is Congressman Jimmy Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, and the ranking member [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=66.16s)]
*  on the Oversight Committee. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, we played that clip of Trump asked about it, sort of asked about it at [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  the sort of campaign rally he did in coordination with Fox. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=76.36s)]
*  And I mean, he doesn't deny it, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=80.92s)]
*  Like, this is not, I don't think the facts are in dispute here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=83.16s)]
*  I don't think anyone disputes the facts as documented in your report. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=85.92s)]
*  Now, he was bragging about it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  His narcissism always interferes with his legal defenses. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  But he openly embraced it and said he did a lot for that money. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=97.52s)]
*  And indeed, he did. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=100.16s)]
*  If you read our report, you will see how he basically killed an investigation and sanctions [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  against ICBC, the Chinese state-owned company that was renting space from him and paying [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=106.56s)]
*  him lots and lots of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Everybody knows the way he covered up for the homicidal crown prince of Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=119.92s)]
*  who also was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year at Trump's hotels, golf [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=125.36s)]
*  courses and so on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=131.28s)]
*  And of course, the big payoff came later with the $2 billion to his son-in-law, to Jared [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=132.28s)]
*  Kushner. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=138.6s)]
*  But the bottom line is there's really no defenses out there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=140.4s)]
*  I mean, his sons have said a couple of things like, well, he didn't take his federal salary. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry, but that's all you're allowed to take, $400,000 from American citizens, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  not from Saudi monarchs and Chinese government bureaucrats. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=155.16s)]
*  You can't take money from United Arab Emirates and Kuwait and Qatar and all of the countries [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  that we enumerate in our report. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about millions of dollars. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  So we want it back. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=168.44s)]
*  He's not allowed to keep a dime of it without coming to Congress first. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  He never came to Congress, and they've been covering up for this for seven years. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And when we finally got the Supreme Court to rule for us and then the district court [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  to do an order, we had four months of compliance before Chairman Comer shut it down, at least [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  according to Trump's lawyers, who said he shut it down. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=189.32s)]
*  We're getting now a mixed message on that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Maybe Trump's lawyers lied, in which case Chairman Comer should make it very clear that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=196.2s)]
*  Mazar's has to continue to comply. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  In any event, we know of $7.8 million that belongs to the American people and not in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=202.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's pockets. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2a6NC--ei8&t=207.68s)]
