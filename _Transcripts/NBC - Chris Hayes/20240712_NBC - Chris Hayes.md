# ‘Gross and getting worse’ Trump allies step up racist, sexist attacks on Kamala Harris
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM)
*  In the aftermath of the first presidential debate and calls from some Democrats for President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden to step aside, we've seen heightened focus on his potential replacement, Vice President [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=4.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=8.0s)]
*  Last night, the president himself highlighted her readiness for the job. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=9.64s)]
*  I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=12.8s)]
*  From the very beginning, I made no bones about that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=17.56s)]
*  She is qualified to be president. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=21.2s)]
*  That's why I picked her. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  That comes amid new polling, finding Harris running as well or in some cases better than [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=25.52s)]
*  Biden in a head-to-head matchup with Donald Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=29.4s)]
*  In one of those surveys out this week, Harris leads Trump 49 to 46 while Biden is behind [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  46 to 47, although we should note that's all right around the margin of error. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump seems to believe that Harris could be a real threat. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=40.96s)]
*  The New York Times reports his team is planning to go after her, the Republican convention [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=43.6s)]
*  next week, working more attacks into the speeches and messaging. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=47.36s)]
*  Trump's conservative allies are also ramping up their attacks on the first female vice [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=51.56s)]
*  president, a woman of Indian and Jamaican descent. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=55.4s)]
*  The rhetoric is, well, gross and getting worse. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=58.2s)]
*  It is also revealing their unified project. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=61.84s)]
*  Beyond destroying Kamala Harris, the conservative movement increasingly is committed to purging [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=64.04s)]
*  women, minorities, particularly black folks, from positions of power in American life. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=69.64s)]
*  They've been hiding that real agenda to essentially resegregate the highest spaces of American [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  life behind a campaign against DEI diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=80.56s)]
*  This was all kind of tipped off in a New York Post that recently ran this opinion base [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=86.82s)]
*  by longtime Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  America soon may be subjected to the country's first DEI president. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=95.1s)]
*  Going on a complaint about the sitting vice president, quote, maybe the most impressively [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=99.74s)]
*  fatuous politician in America may become the leader of the free world because the Democratic [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=103.0s)]
*  Party is unable to break its DEI stranglehold. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=106.85999999999999s)]
*  In front of the cameras, the obvious racism has been even worse. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  Do these donors really think that Kamala Harris is going to do better in Wisconsin, Michigan, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=116.62s)]
*  and Pennsylvania than Joe Biden would? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=120.38s)]
*  I mean, that's the way because it can't, it can't be anybody else, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=121.86s)]
*  Hey, Rob, you're being logical. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=124.46s)]
*  Stop it, all right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=126.3s)]
*  She's a DEI hire, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=127.3s)]
*  She's a woman. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=129.7s)]
*  She's colored, therefore she's got to be good. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=130.94s)]
*  They are in a box where they've got to choose between a mentally incompetent president and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=133.14s)]
*  a DEI vice president. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=137.02s)]
*  If they can drag him across the finish line and install Kamala, we have a DEI presidency [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=138.82s)]
*  that they can celebrate for the rest of the administration. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=144.22s)]
*  Bottom line here is that it's going to go to Kamala, if anybody, because she was a DEI [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=146.82s)]
*  hire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=151.98s)]
*  John, you shouldn't talk like that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=152.42s)]
*  It makes you sound like a racist. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=153.5s)]
*  Don't talk like that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=154.94s)]
*  Can I just say one thing about the first clip we played there is that one of the guests [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=157.26s)]
*  was a bald white dude who became attorney general of the U.S. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  because Donald Trump liked him and his past involved selling toilets for largely endowed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  men, I think. That was his qualification. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=170.33999999999997s)]
*  That guy. Yeah, that's the guy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=172.06s)]
*  Super qualified. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=173.94s)]
*  That's a super qualified dude who became attorney general talking about the poor [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=175.1s)]
*  qualifications of Kamala Harris. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  Now, to be clear, the anti-DEI movement is the right wing agenda. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=180.7s)]
*  It is literally written into their blueprint for a second Trump term, Project 2025. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=185.54s)]
*  Reading from it, they plan to quote, reverse the DEI revolution, saying the next [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  administration should eliminate every one of these wrongful and burdensome ideological [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=194.5s)]
*  projects. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=199.06s)]
*  And this conservative crusade is coming for all sorts of spaces in American life. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=200.38s)]
*  They've just sued a black hedge fund. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=204.1s)]
*  They're coming for higher education. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=206.06s)]
*  You can see it in action. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=207.54s)]
*  So last week, a group led by notorious right wing lawyer, former Texas Solicitor General [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=209.22s)]
*  Jonathan Mitchell, brought a lawsuit in federal court against Northwestern University Law [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=214.82s)]
*  School for discriminating against white men. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=219.18s)]
*  The complaint calls faculty hiring at American universities a cesspool of corruption and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=222.26s)]
*  lawlessness. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=227.38s)]
*  It goes on to allege that left wing faculty and administrators are openly discriminating [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=228.46s)]
*  on account of race and sex when appointing professors. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=232.54s)]
*  Quote, they do this by hiring women and racial minorities with mediocre and undistinguished [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=235.78s)]
*  records over white men who have better credentials, better scholarship and better [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=240.5s)]
*  teaching ability. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=244.18s)]
*  And in the complaint, they just go after a number of scholars of color on the law school [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=245.78s)]
*  faculty, like by name, dragging them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=251.3s)]
*  Now, the fact is Northwestern University Law School, one of the best law schools in the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=254.9s)]
*  nation, hires highly distinguished and experienced women and minorities who have clerked for [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=257.74s)]
*  federal and even Supreme Court justice, authored hundreds of publications, won awards for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=261.94s)]
*  their scholarship and their teaching. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=266.5s)]
*  What the complaint is really saying is this, anyone who's not a white man is suspect by [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=268.06s)]
*  definition and indeed inferior by definition. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=272.38s)]
*  What the complaint is saying, what this ideological product project is saying is we want them [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=276.02s)]
*  out of these spaces. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=280.66s)]
*  And they are already bringing the same racist logic to bear on the former California [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=283.54s)]
*  attorney general and United States senator who has served for three years as the vice [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=287.38s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=291.26s)]
*  The most rabid campaigners against DEI who throw it around as a slur. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=293.42s)]
*  Are devoted to a vision of America where there are no black women law professors and there [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=299.65999999999997s)]
*  are no black women vice presidents and they're too cowardly to come out and say that in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  plain language. But do not for a second forget that is their project. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FPO6JLlgM&t=308.42s)]
