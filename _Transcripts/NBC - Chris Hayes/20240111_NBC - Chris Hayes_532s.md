Video Description: Chris Hayes: “The banal, daily version of those politics is here already. It's not a hypothetical. That version is: people that cross Donald Trump in pursuit of holding accountable law face constant threats of violence and intimidation and harassment, and sometimes actual violence.”

# Hayes: We are already living with a version of Trump’s 'SEAL Team 6' argument
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE)
*  First, though, today Donald Trump was in a place that he will be spending lots of time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=0.0s)]
*  this year, and that is, of course, a courthouse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=5.12s)]
*  This one was for closing arguments in the New York civil trial against the Trump Organization [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=7.82s)]
*  for Fraud. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=13.0s)]
*  The ex-president was there attempting to derail the final day with a statement to the press [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=14.0s)]
*  when he got there and a statement to the press when he left, and in between, a five-minute [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  courtroom rant in his defense, a rant that ended with the judge telling Trump's lawyers, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=22.52s)]
*  quote, control your client. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Trump's antics are getting most of the headlines, but to my mind, the real headline of today [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  happened before anyone arrived at the courthouse. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=35.08s)]
*  Mary, we are just days away from the caucus, and the former president is a world away from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=38.84s)]
*  Iowa here in lower Manhattan, but in many ways this was a campaign stop for Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=44.06s)]
*  He used it as a political move to rally his base, even as he faces real legal consequences [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=49.56s)]
*  for his business here in New York. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=54.66s)]
*  Here at the courthouse in New York, security is a little tighter today following a bomb [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=56.76s)]
*  threat made this morning at the judge's home. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=64.16s)]
*  A bomb threat to Judge Arthur and Goran's home. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=65.16s)]
*  His actual real home, because it's not hard to find people's addresses in the 21st century. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=68.8s)]
*  A threat that delayed the trial this morning because they had to do sweeps and add extra [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=74.12s)]
*  layers of security because someone had called a bomb threat into the judge's home. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=78.56s)]
*  We don't know all the particulars of that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=82.6s)]
*  We don't know who did it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=84.84s)]
*  But it appears to be the latest example of mob style intimidation by pro-Trump MAGA loyalists [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=87.44s)]
*  that has become disturbingly common. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=93.92s)]
*  Just a part of day-to-day life in the Trump era. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Oh, bomb threat. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, got to delay it a little bit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=102.88s)]
*  I mean, remember when this trial began last fall, Judge and Goran had to slap a gag order [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=105.04s)]
*  on Trump after the former president baselessly smeared a court officer on social media saying [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=110.04s)]
*  she was a political operative, including a photo of her in the Post. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=115.76s)]
*  And she and the judge were subsequently flooded with threats. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=119.28s)]
*  And not just threats, anti-Semitic slurs and harassing voicemails. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=122.64s)]
*  She reportedly got 30 threatening calls a day on her cell phone, her personal cell phone. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=126.64s)]
*  50 a day on email and social media. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=133.16s)]
*  The FBI and Homeland Security got involved. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=135.48s)]
*  The court officer, again, this is an anonymous staffer at the court basically, right, now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=138.0s)]
*  needs extra security. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=143.32s)]
*  So on top of that, you now have a bomb threat at, again, the home of the judge. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=146.2s)]
*  I want, these happen in life sometimes, and we sort of say it and move past it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  But I want you to just take a second of like what your day would have been like today if [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=154.92s)]
*  it started with a bomb threat at your home, okay? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  And everything I just said is one Trump trial. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=163.24s)]
*  One. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  It follows a pattern of dangerous and potentially violent intimidation of people who have attempted [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  to hold Donald Trump to account under the rule of law. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=172.56s)]
*  There were the death threats made last month against the Colorado Supreme Court justices [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=175.88s)]
*  who ruled Trump ineligible for the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=180.12s)]
*  having supported the Capitol insurrection. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=184.96s)]
*  A week later, the Secretary of State for Maine, who determined like the Colorado court that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=187.44s)]
*  Trump is similarly ineligible for the ballot, was a victim of a hoax emergency call that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  a man had broken into her home, sending the police there, something called swatting, right, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=198.44s)]
*  with the idea of getting a SWAT team to show up at a person's home. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=203.4s)]
*  Then on Christmas Day, Jack Smith, the Department of Justice special counsel, was targeted with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=207.24s)]
*  one of those fake calls. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=212.04s)]
*  Someone called 911 claiming he had shot his wife. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=214.2s)]
*  Just last weekend, Tonya Chutkin, the federal judge who was overseeing Trump's criminal [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=218.32s)]
*  trial for election interference, when police responded to a false report of a shooting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=222.64s)]
*  at her house, she was home at the time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=228.16s)]
*  To be clear, that was not even the first time Judge Chutkin was threatened over her work [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=231.28s)]
*  on this trial. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=236.24s)]
*  A Texas woman was arrested and charged with threatening a federal judge who was overseeing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=238.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's election case in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=242.76s)]
*  Authorities had already increased security around U.S. District Judge Tonya Chutkin after [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=246.44s)]
*  the former president demanded her recusal last week. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=250.72s)]
*  Prosecutors say the 43-year-old defendant left a threatening voicemail message for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=254.52s)]
*  Chutkin saying, quote, if Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=258.48s)]
*  That was from this past August. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, we just began this week with Trump's lawyer in federal court making [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  the argument that he could send SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival and face [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=271.32s)]
*  zero sanctions or accountability or legal consequences so long as he held on to 34 loyal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  votes in the Senate. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=281.88s)]
*  Now, that is the most extreme version of Trump's openly fascistic vision of politics and power. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=283.72s)]
*  But what I want to stress to you tonight on a day that began with a bomb threat at the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=289.56s)]
*  home of a judge overseeing a trial is the banal daily version of those politics is here [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=293.76s)]
*  already. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=299.12s)]
*  It's not a hypothetical. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=301.8s)]
*  That version is people that cross Donald Trump in pursuit of holding him accountable to the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=304.76s)]
*  law face constant threats of violence and intimidation and harassment and sometimes [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=309.24s)]
*  actual violence. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=315.32s)]
*  Most obvious example being, of course, January 6 when he told people to march to the Capitol [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=317.56s)]
*  and he said it will be wild. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  And after they hit ransack the Capitol and he watched them do it, he went after his vice [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=323.8s)]
*  president Mike Pence, who was in a secure location with the Secret Service, painting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  a target on the man's back, putting Pence in genuine physical peril with rioters erecting [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=332.52s)]
*  in gallows with a noose. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=337.68s)]
*  Trump's celebration of violent threats against his perceived antagonist goes back years. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=347.44s)]
*  you? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=351.92s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=352.92s)]
*  Okay, just knock the hell out. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=353.92s)]
*  I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=356.08s)]
*  I promise. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  him thrown in rough. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=364.64s)]
*  I said, please don't be too nice. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=366.8s)]
*  I love the old days. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=374.4s)]
*  Like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=378.76s)]
*  People hear this message loud and clear, no matter how much he tries to cover it in the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  cadence of comedy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=390.08s)]
*  People like, for instance, real people like Cesar Sayoc. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=392.24s)]
*  Remember that name? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=394.64s)]
*  The devoted MAGA fan who went to lots of Trump rallies in the lead up to the 2018 midterms. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=395.88s)]
*  You may know him better as the MAGA bomber who, on the eve of those midterms, made a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=402.24s)]
*  list of people he saw as enemies of Donald Trump and mailed them pipe bombs. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=406.04s)]
*  People like Joe Biden and George Soros and Barack Obama. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=411.76s)]
*  And then there was the attack on Nancy Pelosi's elderly husband, Paul, who on the eve of the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=415.0s)]
*  next midterms in 2022 was nearly killed in his home with a hammer by a man who had fallen [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=419.32s)]
*  down a right-wing rabbit hole on the Internet. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=424.88s)]
*  Paul Pelosi had his skull fractured. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=427.4s)]
*  And what did Trump do? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=429.96s)]
*  What does he still do today? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=432.0s)]
*  He jokes about that attack. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  Continuously, it's part of his routine, sending the message to everyone who listens to him [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=435.56s)]
*  that it was funny and it was good that the man nearly killed Paul Pelosi with a hammer [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=439.76s)]
*  in his home. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=445.76s)]
*  That that is a funny thing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=447.28s)]
*  And he's out there doing it right now, just the other day. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=450.68s)]
*  That's the immunity argument where his lawyers argue he could order the assassination of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  political rivals. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=458.8s)]
*  Trump comes outside to threaten violence. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=460.04s)]
*  He said there will be, quote, bedlam in the country if he doesn't get immunity from prosecution [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  for his crimes. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9zfH4XDAsE&t=466.16s)]
