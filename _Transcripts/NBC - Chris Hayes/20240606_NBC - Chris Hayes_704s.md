# 'Long time coming': Steve Bannon ordered to surrender to prison July 1
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Steve Bannon is going to prison. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been a long time coming. Today, the former adviser to Donald Trump, who wears two button-down [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=4.16s)]
*  shirts on top of each other for no discernible reason, was ordered to report to prison for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=10.52s)]
*  four months starting on July 1st for his conviction on federal contempt of Congress charges nearly [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  two years ago. Bannon, you might remember, was subpoenaed by the January 6th select committee [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=20.82s)]
*  back in 2021. And like fellow Trump adviser Peter Navarro and several members of Congress, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=25.56s)]
*  including Jim Jordan and Scott Barry, he just flatly refused to comply. Didn't evoke his [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=32.04s)]
*  Fifth Amendment, just said, no, go take a hike. Now, Navarro was also convicted of contempt [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=36.68s)]
*  and is currently in a federal prison in Miami after appealing his case all the way up to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=43.04s)]
*  the Supreme Court, which refused to bail him out. Bannon, too, played out a lengthy appeals [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=47.56s)]
*  process, which he ultimately lost. Though we should note this is hardly Mr. Bannon's first [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=52.68s)]
*  brush with the law. You might remember back in 2020, Steve Bannon was arrested on the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=57.64s)]
*  yacht of a Chinese billionaire. And in fact, if he were not bailed out by a last minute [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=63.72s)]
*  pardon from Donald Trump on the final day of Trump's presidency, Bannon may already [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=68.48s)]
*  have been imprisoned following the federal indictment from Trump's own Department of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=72.86s)]
*  Justice, an indictment which says he grifted millions of dollars from hundreds of thousands [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=76.44s)]
*  of Trump supporters through phony claims that he would privately fund construction [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=82.2s)]
*  of the border wall. They didn't really do it. Two of his co-defendants in that case [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=87.08s)]
*  pleaded guilty to those charges. A third was convicted of trial. They are currently serving [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  between three and five years in federal prison as part of the same plot that Bannon was accused [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=97.4s)]
*  of being part of. Bannon, however, was spared that fate by his former boss after January [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  6th when Bannon proved himself to be a vital ally during the attempted coup, including, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=109.84s)]
*  as the January 6th committee revealed, frequent contact with Trump in the hours before the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=116.04s)]
*  insurrection. While certain close associates of President Trump privately expressed concerns [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=121.14s)]
*  about what would occur on January 6th, other members of the president's inner circle spoke [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  with great anticipation about the events to come. The committee has learned from the White [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=131.76s)]
*  House phone logs that the president spoke to Steve Bannon, his close advisor, at least [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=137.12s)]
*  twice on January 5th. The first conversation they had lasted for 11 minutes. From those [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=142.32s)]
*  same phone logs, we know that the president and Mr. Bannon spoke again on the phone that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  evening, this time for six minutes. We also know that Bannon was an advisor to the group [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  of Trump allies who met at their so-called command center at the Willard Hotel in Washington, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  D.C., ahead of January 6th to plot ways to steal the 2020 election. In fact, according [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=162.36s)]
*  to journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Bannon was at the Willard when Trump called [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=167.84s)]
*  him on the night of January 5th. And to be clear, Bannon wasn't trying to hide his involvement [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  in the scheme. In the days and weeks before January 6th, he dedicated hours of his daily [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=179.3s)]
*  podcast to the big lie of a stolen election, often dropping less than subtle hints that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=185.24s)]
*  something explosive was in the works. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=190.36s)]
*  People are getting revved up. People are getting fired up. People are getting madder as they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=193.8s)]
*  should. Mike Pence's, his moment of destiny awaits him, and it's coming on the 6th of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=197.96s)]
*  January. It's to have clarity that January 6th was going to be the day, or one of these [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=204.96s)]
*  big days, and you had to converge everything down to January 6th. Starting tomorrow, it's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  going to be wild. It's like two days. So it's incredible. You're going to be part of history. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=214.24s)]
*  We want as many people to get here as possible. His first term is ending with action, and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=218.96s)]
*  his second term is going to start with a bang. All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=222.72s)]
*  Just understand this. All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=228.68s)]
*  Now almost two years after being convicted, Steve Bannon is going to prison. But that's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=232.2s)]
*  not all, because Bannon is also facing a state criminal indictment here in New York, once [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=237.16s)]
*  again for that same scheme to rip off diehard Trump supporters and steal their money from [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=242.08s)]
*  them. Just like everyone else in Trump world, Bannon likes to whine about vengeance is coming [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=247.8s)]
*  for the people who put him away. The real explanation is much simpler. Donald Trump's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  criminal, convicted on 34 felony counts, who surrounds himself with a bunch of other criminals, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=260.72s)]
*  like Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro and his longtime political operative Roger Stone, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=265.88s)]
*  who Trump sprung from jail ahead of the 2020 election, and Paul Manafort, Trump's former [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=270.32s)]
*  campaign manager sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on a fraud conviction, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=274.52s)]
*  who was also freed by his former boss, and Rick Gates, Trump's deputy campaign manager, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=278.28s)]
*  who got prison time on charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI, and George Papadopoulos, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=282.52s)]
*  the former Trump campaign ad, who did a brief stint in prison for lying to investigators about [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=286.96s)]
*  his contacts with Russia. He also got a Trump pardon. And of course, Michael Cohen, who got [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=290.84s)]
*  sentenced to three years in prison for the work he did for Donald Trump, partly for his role in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=296.24s)]
*  the Stormy Daniels hush money scheme, among other charges, and Allen Weisselberg, the former Trump [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=300.32s)]
*  organization CFO, who is currently, as I speak to you right now, in a cell in Rikers Island, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=305.0s)]
*  awaiting a $2 million payment from Trump to keep his mouth shut. So Steve Bannon joins a real [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=309.32s)]
*  rogues gallery of Trump associates going to prison. And he could talk all he wants about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  revenge. But his number one concern should be finding a guest host for his podcast for four [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=323.92s)]
*  months. Joining me now is Glenn Kirchner, former federal prosecutor who is inside the courtroom [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=329.96s)]
*  with Steve Bannon today, the Kate Coppin staff writer for the Atlantic, who's covered Steve [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=336.28s)]
*  Bannon extensively, even once getting kicked out of his 2020 rooftop election party, which is a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  great sentence to utter. He also has a piece, author of the new piece of the dangers of a second [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump term. Glenn, let me, let me start with you because you were in the court today. I guess it [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=350.52s)]
*  was an open question about whether the judge would actually say, times up, time to go to prison, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=355.36s)]
*  how to play out. You know, Chris, not only was it an open question, I think most of us were on the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=360.16s)]
*  edges of our seats because you really could not read where Judge Carl Nichols was going. John [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=367.44s)]
*  Crabb was the prosecutor. Former colleague of mine from the U.S. Attorney's Office made a very [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=374.44s)]
*  compelling argument as to why now that the appellate court definitively shot down the one legal [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=379.44s)]
*  issue that Judge Nichols said was kind of an open question in his mind, which is what prompted him [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=387.48s)]
*  to allow Steve Bannon to remain on release pending appeal. David Shone got up and made what I thought [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=394.28s)]
*  were some valid points. And as he was questioning the prosecutor and the defense attorney, you really [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=401.24s)]
*  could not read where Judge Nichols was going to land. And I think it wasn't until the very end of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=408.32s)]
*  his announced findings that it became clear that he said now that the appellate court has basically [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  definitively resolved the one question of law that Judge Nichols thought might be available to win [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=420.76s)]
*  Steve Bannon some relief on appeal. Then he just kind of brought the hammer down. He said, you will [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=428.56s)]
*  report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons no later than July 1st to begin serving your sentence. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=434.24s)]
*  And then something happened that rarely happens in federal court. I saw David Shone sort of sprint [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=440.0s)]
*  up to the lectern. And I can tell you from being in that courthouse for years, usually you wait for [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=446.88s)]
*  an invitation from the judge before you approach the lectern. And he was loud and he was angry. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=452.92s)]
*  And the judge really had to put him in his place. But I don't know if that was performance for [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=459.52s)]
*  Bannon or perhaps somebody above Bannon. But it was pretty clear at that point that the judge had [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=465.12s)]
*  made up his mind and would not revisit his ruling. Yeah, I mean, they all, as far as I can tell, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  everyone in that world likes to throw temper tantrums and throw their toys on the floor when [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=476.35999999999996s)]
*  they get upset about something that doesn't go their way. I mean, the thing about Bannon, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  McKay, there's two aspects. One is, part of it is he's got this professional wrestling heel [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=485.8s)]
*  shtick he does. Like, I'm Steve Bannon and I'm so tough and scary and you should all be cowering. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's like, all right, settle down there, Magneto. We're going to be fine. But there's also [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=497.76s)]
*  the fact that in some ways, there's a level at which the cover-up kind of worked. We never got [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  the testimony from him. There was a reason he wanted to keep shut about it. Now he's going to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=510.44s)]
*  go to four months in prison. Yeah, Steve Bannon is such a weird character in my life because I feel [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=514.72s)]
*  like, like many political reporters, he's just been this person that I've had to deal with for [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=524.32s)]
*  like a decade at this point, right? He was, you know, a subject of mine. He's been a source of mine. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=530.9200000000001s)]
*  He ran one of the most kind of poisonous right-wing media outlets in America for a while. Then he [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=536.28s)]
*  helped get Trump elected. He's in the White House. And throughout all of this, you know, I will say, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=542.7600000000001s)]
*  just as an aside to your point, I often kind of struggled with how to depict him because he clearly [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=548.72s)]
*  was one of these people who enjoyed so much being depicted as like a super villain character that I [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=554.6400000000001s)]
*  sometimes wondered if I was like doing his bidding by contributing to that characterization. But what [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=561.2s)]
*  I will say is that like Steve Bannon eventually, you know, like throughout all of this time, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=568.48s)]
*  just acted with complete impunity. And I remember when he was pardoned on the last day of Trump's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=574.04s)]
*  presidency, feeling like and talking to other reporters about this and just feeling like this [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=579.16s)]
*  guy is never going to be held accountable. Like he has escaped accountability. But what's been [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=584.48s)]
*  interesting in the last several years is watching all these people in Trump's orbit, you know, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  one by one actually face accountability, including Donald Trump himself. That's kind of culminated [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=594.12s)]
*  with his conviction. And so it is kind of a surreal moment for, I think, journalists like me and just [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=599.88s)]
*  people who have been following Trump and his allies for so long, seeing them finally kind of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=605.96s)]
*  get their comeuppance. It's kind of almost it's hard to fathom. Yeah. And, you know, in this case, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=612.16s)]
*  Glenn, you know, the sentence is the duration of a semester abroad. So it's not an insanely long [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=619.72s)]
*  sentence, but he is not out of the woods. I mean, the New York case against him, as we said before, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtUOwdHkvs&t=625.08s)]
