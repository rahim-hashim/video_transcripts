# 'Think of your children': Top GOP senator voted to acquit Trump over safety fears, book says
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Tonight it feels like another line has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=0.0s)]
*  crossed in American democracy with the discovery that the United States senators feeling the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=4.12s)]
*  threat of violence to them or their families from Donald Trump and his supporters changed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=8.94s)]
*  their votes on perhaps the most important vote many of them ever took, the second impeachment [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=13.56s)]
*  of Donald Trump. Of course, that fateful vote, acquitting Trump of inciting an insurrection [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=18.88s)]
*  on January 6th, allowed for the situation we currently find ourselves in with that four [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=24.72s)]
*  time criminally indicted defendant likely to be a coin flip away from the presidency [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=29.68s)]
*  next year. This new revelation about the impact of the MAGA threat of violence in Congress [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=33.8s)]
*  comes from an explosive excerpt of a forthcoming biography of Utah Senator Mitt Romney as told [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=39.6s)]
*  by author McKay Coppens, quote, When one senator, a member of leadership, said he was leaning [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  toward voting to convict Trump, the others urged him to reconsider. You can't do that, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=50.8s)]
*  Romney recalled someone saying. Think of your personal safety, said another. Think of your [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=57.64s)]
*  children. McKay Coppens received unparalleled access to Senator Romney, who gave his apparently [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=62.92s)]
*  unvarnished thoughts and observations to his biographer. And Romney's revelation about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=69.16s)]
*  the second impeachment vote really connects the dots in the story of how Trump and his [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  movement have used and continue to use intimidation, menace to pursue their political [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=78.12s)]
*  ends. It's a story that we've covered quite a bit on this program, but I think it remains [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=84.68s)]
*  somewhat untold because, of course, many people don't want to publicize their security [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=89.84s)]
*  concerns. Those who have been the target of Donald Trump's invective were targeted by [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=95.12s)]
*  his followers mostly don't want to talk to the press about it and invite greater threat. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  A few figures have bravely come forward to confirm the dangers they have faced for standing in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=105.2s)]
*  the way, like former Congressman Peter Meyer of Michigan and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=109.32s)]
*  who both shared details about the death threats they received after voting for Trump's second [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=113.88s)]
*  impeachment. So I'll tell you, the threats are constant. They've increased. I even heard a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=119.32s)]
*  voicemail just this morning that we got last night threatening execution. That's kind of seems [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=126.92s)]
*  to be the normal thing nowadays was just threaten execution. We have security. We've had to up our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=131.4s)]
*  security posture and we're aware, but we're going to move on. It's not going to hinder us and it's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  not going to intimidate us. Now, to be clear, all sorts of people in public life across the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=143.24s)]
*  political spectrum receive threats. Unfortunately, that's sort of part of how things operate these [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=147.24s)]
*  days. That's not new. There's something different here, right? In the age of Trump, those threats [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=151.72s)]
*  became very real and acute. During his first run for president, Donald Trump explicitly encouraged [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=156.12s)]
*  violence among his supporters. He told them at his rallies, quote, knock the crap out of any protesters [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=162.36s)]
*  and I'll pay the legal fees. And we've seen that endorsement of violence take hold among his [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=167.4s)]
*  supporters. We've seen pipe bombs mailed to his perceived political enemies and planted the DNC [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=172.36s)]
*  and RNC on the eve of January 6th. We saw the home of Speaker Nancy Pelosi invaded her husband, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=177.8s)]
*  attacked with a hammer. This is not an abstraction. We've seen it. The threat of violence in the Trump [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=183.08s)]
*  era is tangible and it comes with serious costs, emotional and psychological ones, as well as just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=190.36s)]
*  concrete dollars and cents financial costs. Many people who have found themselves targeted by [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=196.52s)]
*  Donald Trump or his followers do not necessarily have the means to secure 24 seven security for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  themselves and their families. Mitt Romney actually lays this out to make hate copies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=209.32s)]
*  Most members of Congress don't have security details. Their addresses are publicly available [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=214.28s)]
*  online. Romney himself had been shelling out $5,000 a day since the January 6th riot to cover [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  private security for his family, an expense he knew most of his colleagues couldn't afford. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=225.72s)]
*  For someone like Romney who can pay that staggering amount, it's probably a prudent expense given the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  fact that he's become a top MAGA enemy. You may remember Romney was the only Republican senator [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=236.92s)]
*  to vote for the first impeachment of Donald Trump. And at the time he delivered a moving, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=243.48s)]
*  forceful, persuasive speech explaining how seriously he took that decision and why it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  mattered so much to him. As a senator juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=262.44s)]
*  I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=282.04s)]
*  I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=286.52s)]
*  the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=290.52s)]
*  wrong. That was just the beginning of Romney's defiance to the Trump wing of his party and the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  peril he would face as a result. As Romney told his biographer ahead of January 6th, he received [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=302.52s)]
*  a warning from one of his colleagues, Angus King of Maine, who's an independent who caucuses with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=309.24s)]
*  the Democrats and quote, King informs him of a conversation he's just had with a high ranking [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=313.24s)]
*  Pentagon official. Law enforcement has been tracking online chatter among right-wing extremists. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=318.36s)]
*  Romney's name has been popping up in some frightening corners of the internet. He isn't [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=323.72s)]
*  sure Romney will be safe. Romney immediately texted the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  telling him about the call from King, quote, There are calls to burn down your home, Mitch, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=333.64s)]
*  to smuggle guns into D.C. and to storm the Capitol. I hope that sufficient security [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=338.2s)]
*  plans are in place, but I am concerned the instigator, the president, is the one who commands [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=343.88s)]
*  the reinforcements the D.C. and Capitol police might require. What did Mitch McConnell say? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=347.88s)]
*  Never even bothered to respond. So just imagine how Mitt Romney and his other colleagues who [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=355.0s)]
*  received those warnings were feeling going into the Capitol on January 6th and when he was rushed [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=360.84s)]
*  off the Senate floor after rioters breached the building and nearly ran straight into the violent [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=366.12s)]
*  mob. Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman guided him to safety, as you can see in this now [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=371.48s)]
*  infamous clip. Romney and the rest of the senators then spent hours hunkered down in a secure location [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=377.64s)]
*  while the mob rampaged to the Capitol, assaulting officers, including Goodman. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=383.64s)]
*  In the wake of that awful day, the members of Congress were faced with the question of whether [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=389.0s)]
*  to impeach and convict Donald Trump for the crime of inciting an insurrection. They all knew to a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=392.52s)]
*  person he did it. They were there. We all saw it. Their lives were at risk. And as several Republicans [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  told Romney, they wanted to vote to convict, but they were afraid. Quote, one Republican [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=406.12s)]
*  congressman confided to Romney that he wanted to vote for Trump's second impeachment, but chose not [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  to out of fear for his family's safety. The congressman reasoned that Trump would be impeached [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=416.6s)]
*  by House Democrats with or without him. Why put his wife and children at risk if it wouldn't change [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=421.48s)]
*  the outcome? Later, during the Senate trial, Romney heard the same calculation while talking [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=425.96s)]
*  with a small group of Republican colleagues. When one senator, a member of leadership, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=431.24s)]
*  said he was leaning toward voting to convict, the others urged him to reconsider. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=436.68s)]
*  You can't do that, Romney recalled someone saying. Think of your personal safety, said another. Think [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=440.92s)]
*  of your children. The senator eventually decided they were right. Mitt Romney was one of just seven [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=445.88s)]
*  Republican senators to vote to convict Trump, but he was able to make a different calculation [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=452.68s)]
*  than many of his colleagues. He's got no political ambitions past this office. He's retiring next [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=457.4s)]
*  year. He's independently phenomenally wealthy. He can afford $5,000 a day to protect himself [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=462.04s)]
*  and his family. The combination of that unique position dependent on basically no one and his [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=467.4s)]
*  character, his faith, means that he was able to do what many others could not or would not. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=473.24s)]
*  But it is maddening to think that others might have followed and Donald Trump might have been [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  convicted, but for the fear that the violent mob that had just sacked the Capitol would hunt down [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=484.28s)]
*  those who voted yes. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  you [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-Wvd8XDyY&t=514.28s)]
