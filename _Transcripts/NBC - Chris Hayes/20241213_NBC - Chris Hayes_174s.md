# Trump sends Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece amid Don Jr. breakup rumors
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00)
*  According to the latest tally by Media Matters, Donald Trump has selected more than a dozen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=0.0s)]
*  former Fox News hosts, personalities, and staffers to be in his incoming administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=4.64s)]
*  Most infamously is former Fox and Friends weekend host Pete Hegseth to run the Department [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=10.02s)]
*  of Defense. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=14.32s)]
*  There's also former Fox weekend host and Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to be the United States [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=15.32s)]
*  ambassador to Israel, former Real World Reality star and Fox business host Sean Duffy as his [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=20.16s)]
*  choice for Secretary of Transportation, among many others. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  At one level, now this is really surprising, it's long been clear that Fox News is basically [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=29.12s)]
*  Trump's entire mental universe. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=33.1s)]
*  He spends most of his waking time consuming cable news all day, every day, and he wants [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=35.44s)]
*  all his favorite friends from the TV to staff his White House. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=40.4s)]
*  I gotta say though, I'm surprised by one particular Fox alumnus that Trump chose to serve his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=43.2s)]
*  administration from really far away. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=49.0s)]
*  On Tuesday night, Trump announced that he would be appointing Kimberly Guilfoyle to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  be his ambassador to Greece. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=56.96s)]
*  Guilfoyle spent more than a decade at Fox News before she abruptly left the network, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=59.92s)]
*  apparently over claims of sexual harassment, which she denies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=64.08s)]
*  In a statement, Trump wrote, quote, Guilfoyle's extensive experience and leadership in law, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=68.2s)]
*  media, and politics, along with her sharp intellect, make her supremely qualified to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  represent the United States and safeguard its interests abroad, adding, congratulations, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=76.36s)]
*  Kimberly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=81.88s)]
*  Now, many people's first reaction was, whoa, is he really sending his own son off to another [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=82.88s)]
*  continent? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=87.88s)]
*  After all, Trump Jr. has been engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle for years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=88.88s)]
*  But there's been no mention of Don Jr. following her to Europe. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=94.28s)]
*  It appears he won't be going. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=97.64s)]
*  This comes amid much speculation in the tabloids that the happy couple has indeed split up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=99.64s)]
*  As the New York Times put it rather diplomatically, the announcement came as Donald Trump Jr. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=105.28s)]
*  has been seen with the socialite Bettina Anderson in Florida. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=110.04s)]
*  So as far as we can tell, Kimberly Guilfoyle will make the 5,000 mile journey to live in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  Greece as the American ambassador, and Don Jr. will just kind of do his thing here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=119.92s)]
*  Honestly, it's still a pretty sweet, soft landing, and ambassadorship is an enormous [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=125.04s)]
*  deal. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  You get to carry the title for life. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  There are certainly worse places to be sent than Greece. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  And if we know anything about Kimberly Guilfoyle, she is nothing if not an optimist. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=134.4s)]
*  The best is yet to come! [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3bWuimAI00&t=138.6s)]
