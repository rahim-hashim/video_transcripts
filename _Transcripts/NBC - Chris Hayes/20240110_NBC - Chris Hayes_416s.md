# George Conway: Trump’s lawyer walked into ‘nasty’ trap at immunity hearing
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw)
*  They are now awaiting a decision any day, any moment from the D.C. Court of Appeals [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=0.0s)]
*  on whether Donald Trump is immune, as he claims, from criminal charges for attempting to overturn [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=3.6s)]
*  the election. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=8.16s)]
*  In yesterday's hearing on this, the three judges in the panel certainly seem skeptical. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=9.16s)]
*  Conservative attorney George Conway, who was in that courtroom, points out that Trump's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=14.72s)]
*  lawyers had a difficult case to begin with because their position is clearly not correct [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=17.92s)]
*  under either precedent or the Constitution. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=22.96s)]
*  But in making the arguments they had, they also fell into a trap. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=25.32s)]
*  It happened when one judge, Florence Pan, pressed Trump's lawyers on the implications [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=29.3s)]
*  of his argument. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=34.1s)]
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=35.1s)]
*  impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=41.3s)]
*  If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=45.6s)]
*  In response to that moment, Conway writes, quote, the damage was done and Pan's point [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=49.14s)]
*  was devastatingly made. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=53.46s)]
*  On the one hand, Trump's lawyer argued the Constitution gave the president absolute immunity [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=54.9s)]
*  for his official acts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=59.42s)]
*  On the other hand, if the United States Congress effectively gives permission by impeaching [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=60.42s)]
*  and convicting, well then yes, a president can be prosecuted and wait for it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=64.1s)]
*  He's not absolutely immune. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=68.02s)]
*  George Conway joins me now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=70.42s)]
*  He's a contributing writer for The Atlantic. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=71.74s)]
*  So I found your argument here interesting and it was not the way, it didn't dawn on me [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=73.34s)]
*  in the same way that it did to you, that moment. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=79.94s)]
*  And I want you to explain why that, and Judge Pan was very focused on it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=83.22s)]
*  She kept coming at it again and again and again. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=87.78s)]
*  Why that moment was so important for his Trump's argument sort of collapsing? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=91.02s)]
*  Well there are a couple of reasons for that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=98.14s)]
*  First of all, Judge Pan was trying to do two things as I see it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=100.7s)]
*  One was she was trying to elicit a concession from Trump's counsel that, no, that his position [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=105.32s)]
*  was extreme. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=112.6s)]
*  And at the same time when Trump's counsel resisted saying that yes, a president is absolutely [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=114.14s)]
*  immune for sending in SEAL Team 6, she then sort of went to the underbelly of the argument [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  that he was making as to why it wasn't always the case, which was this argument based upon [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=131.94s)]
*  provision that Trump relies on, which is the impeachment judgment clause, which says that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=137.8s)]
*  you can prosecute somebody criminally after you impeach and remove them through Congress. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=144.86s)]
*  And her point really was that there was a tension between those two positions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  In addition to the fact that the position he was taking was extreme under one clause, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  the second clause, I mean the second provision, which is the impeachment judgment provision, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=160.3s)]
*  obviously undercuts the absolute immunity claim because it makes clear that officeholders, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=165.62s)]
*  and it doesn't exclude the president, can be prosecuted after being removed from office. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=171.36s)]
*  And so she kept drilling on that and then she makes the point that, okay, well if you're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=176.5s)]
*  saying that he can be prosecuted under some circumstances when Congress does impeach and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  convict and remove a president, you're not saying he's absolutely immune. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=187.4s)]
*  So that's the reason why Trump's position collapsed was it was not only was it extreme, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=193.14s)]
*  but it was at war with itself. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=202.42s)]
*  And when you get that kind of, and the other thing that made it worse for Trump's lawyer [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=206.5s)]
*  is when you're going to have to make a concession to a judge who is very smart and is not going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=211.1s)]
*  to let things go, you make the concession. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=217.5s)]
*  You say yes, that's, I mean, because it is their position that a president who's not [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=220.96s)]
*  impeached and removed can get away with anything. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=225.26000000000002s)]
*  It has to be their position because there's not much worse other than perhaps sending [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  SEAL Team 6 to the Capitol than what he did. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=232.02s)]
*  So you know, sometimes you just have to accept the fact that your position is out there because [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=235.8s)]
*  it's the only one you can take. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=241.12s)]
*  Now it's a loser to be sure, but you do not make a weak argument stronger by blending [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=242.62s)]
*  it with an even weaker one. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  Appellate advocacy 101 in addition to, you know, answer the questions. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  So that's such an interesting and I think really important point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=255.64s)]
*  I just want to stay with it for a second because I think it's key. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=258.24s)]
*  The opening bid right from Trump's lawyers is he is absolutely immune for official acts [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=260.8s)]
*  at the outer perimeter of his official duties. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=266.56s)]
*  And that means anything from sending SEAL Team 6 as Jack Smith's office, I think smartly [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=268.96s)]
*  sort of raised to selling pardons. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  These are clearly, we would say, criminal enterprises, but they're they intermixed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=276.38s)]
*  with official acts. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=281.08s)]
*  And what you're saying is rather what they realized, I think, is that that was too extreme [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=282.76s)]
*  and they needed a fallback. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  So they've concocted this sort of, you know, forget FACACTA. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=289.04s)]
*  FACACTA is a good word. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=293.8s)]
*  FACACTA, Roomba Goldberg. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=295.56s)]
*  Michigan also would be a good word too. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=296.56s)]
*  Construction, which is like this weird impeachment thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=298.8s)]
*  And you're saying by constructing the fallback so that you're not making the extreme argument, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=302.64s)]
*  you're also undercutting the clarity of the argument itself. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=307.06s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=311.26s)]
*  And it goes even beyond the fact that it's that the impeachment judgment clause is inconsistent [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=312.26s)]
*  with absolute presidential criminal immunity. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=318.41999999999996s)]
*  The rationales that he was presenting were inconsistent. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=323.38s)]
*  His rationale that he kept repeating to the panel, Sauer, Trump's lawyer, he kept saying [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=328.4s)]
*  the reason why we have to have absolute criminal immunity is because of the specter that some [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=336.64s)]
*  other president, his client actually, might go and start prosecuting, engaging in political [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=342.34s)]
*  prosecutions to punish his enemies. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  OK, well, that's OK. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  That's not a crazy argument. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't want political prosecutions of politicians for simply doing their jobs. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=354.92s)]
*  On the other hand, the argument that he said that, well, you can prosecute a president [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=360.56s)]
*  when the Congress of the United States says you can. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  And excuse me, that's the most political spot in the universe right there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=369.36s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=375.24s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=376.24s)]
*  So his argument made no sense on many levels. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=377.24s)]
*  That is a really, really excellent point. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=381.48s)]
*  And thank you for the backdrop. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=383.6s)]
*  It really helped. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=384.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=385.6s)]
*  Well, we do what we can. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=386.6s)]
*  George Conway, who was in that room, who himself has been around the D.C. circuit and argued [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=387.6s)]
*  in that venue. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjATbiTgZw&t=413.16s)]
