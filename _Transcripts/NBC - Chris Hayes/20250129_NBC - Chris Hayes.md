# Trump blasting Elon to space? Musk told to ‘go get’ those astronauts
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk)
*  Earlier this month, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics identified what appeared [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=0.0s)]
*  to be a previously undiscovered asteroid orbiting precariously close to the Earth. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=4.44s)]
*  The next day, the center issued a correction. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=9.96s)]
*  It wasn't an asteroid after all. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=12.24s)]
*  It was rather some kind of artificial object. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=13.76s)]
*  In fact, it was a car, a Tesla, specifically the Tesla Roadster that Elon Musk launched [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=15.96s)]
*  into orbit as a publicity stunt back in 2018. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=22.72s)]
*  It's still up there, floating forever in the vast emptiness of space. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=25.28s)]
*  Here on Earth, Musk must envy that solitude because his time in the public eye as President [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=29.46s)]
*  Donald Trump's co-president has not made him very popular. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=34.94s)]
*  Back in April of 2022, a YouGov poll found that about half the country had a favorable [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=39.7s)]
*  view of the billionaire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=44.58s)]
*  Today, those numbers have flipped. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=45.74s)]
*  Now 52% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Musk, according to a new survey. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=47.58s)]
*  The same poll found that 60% of Americans think the president relying on the advice [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=53.14s)]
*  of billionaires is a bad thing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=57.98s)]
*  Only 12% actually like that idea. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  And it's not just the public who's apparently growing weary of Musk. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  There are reports that he's overstaying his welcome within Trump's inner circle. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=65.72s)]
*  Trump himself has apparently been complaining that he's around a lot. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=70.0s)]
*  But if you read Trump's social media posts, it almost sounds like he's come up with a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  solution for that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=76.96s)]
*  Launch Musk into space. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=78.38s)]
*  In a new post on social media, Trump writes, quote, I've just asked Elon Musk and SpaceX [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=81.02s)]
*  to go get the two brave astronauts who've been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=86.26s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=90.94s)]
*  They've been waiting for many months on space station. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=91.94s)]
*  Elon will soon be on his way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=94.7s)]
*  Hopefully all will be safe. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=97.5s)]
*  Good luck, Elon, end quote. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=100.26s)]
*  Trump appears to be referring to Sunni Williams and Butch Wilmore, two NASA astronauts who've [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=103.18s)]
*  been living on the International Space Station for about six months after their initial 10-day [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  trip was extended because of technical difficulties. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=111.54s)]
*  To be clear, Musk's company, SpaceX, is already scheduled to get them back home in March, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=114.94s)]
*  although it doesn't seem like Musk was planning to go personally. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=119.1s)]
*  Maybe Trump just needs a little space. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=122.74s)]
*  Good luck, Elon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=126.5s)]
*  Good luck, Elon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_eKd0VSnk&t=144.94s)]
