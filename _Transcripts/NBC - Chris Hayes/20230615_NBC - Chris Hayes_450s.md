# DeSantis favorability ratings crater after campaign announcement
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8)
*  In November last year, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis won re-election by nearly 20 points. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=0.0s)]
*  By January of this year, his national favorability numbers were looking really good for a state [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  figure. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=11.78s)]
*  According to the polling average, about 45 percent of Americans had a favorable view [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  of the governor versus only 35 percent who held an unfavorable view of him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=16.12s)]
*  But it seems the more voters see of DeSantis, the less they like him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=21.48s)]
*  His hard-right campaign, Bazaar Crusade against Disney, have alienated independent voters. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=24.6s)]
*  His decision to run against Trump has made him an enemy of the MAGA crowd. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=29.46s)]
*  Since he announced his campaign for the presidency late last month, DeSantis' national favorability [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=33.1s)]
*  ratings have cratered. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=37.58s)]
*  As of today, approximately 48 percent of voters view him unfavorably versus just 36 percent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=39.58s)]
*  who like him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=44.82s)]
*  And when it comes to Republican primary voters, things aren't looking much better. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=45.82s)]
*  A new Quinnipiac poll has the governor losing to Trump by 30 points nationally. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=49.46s)]
*  A brand new survey out of New Hampshire has DeSantis down by 32. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=55.62s)]
*  David Jolly is a former Republican congressman from Florida, and he joins me now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=59.62s)]
*  David, I wanted to talk to you tonight because when we were in Miami, you and I spoke and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=64.06s)]
*  we talked about DeSantis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=70.58s)]
*  And one of the things you said was, you know, he just does not wear well, basically, is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=72.74s)]
*  what you said. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=78.82s)]
*  And I thought about that commentary when I saw those numbers today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=79.82s)]
*  What do you make of him? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=83.58s)]
*  Yeah, one of the few candidates that announces and then his numbers fall. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=84.58s)]
*  You typically don't see that for somebody that's such a strong candidate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=88.82s)]
*  Look, Ron DeSantis is a uniquely unlikable person. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=91.98s)]
*  And as you get to know him, you discover it's this odd mix of vanity and paranoia and kind [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=95.22s)]
*  of the smartest person in the room complex. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=100.76s)]
*  The problem is, the moment then he demonstrates his intelligence, he says things that are [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=103.3s)]
*  antithetical to science and history and law and the Constitution, and it leaves people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=107.06s)]
*  kind of scratching their head. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=112.26s)]
*  I do think, though, if he has one thing going for him, Chris, is his political skill is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=113.78s)]
*  he knows how to skate to where the puck's going. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=119.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=121.58000000000001s)]
*  He was he was in front of the Tea Party wave. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  He was an early evangelist for Trumpism. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=124.26s)]
*  And then as Trump lost, he had basically created this culture war movement in today's Republican [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  politics. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=132.9s)]
*  And so if there is one candidate still today that could figure out how to best Donald Trump [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=133.9s)]
*  the former president's legal vulnerabilities, I do think it's Ron DeSantis. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  I think it could be fairly cagey. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=142.82s)]
*  I'm looking to see some candidate, probably DeSantis, begin to call for a speedy trial [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=144.61999999999998s)]
*  and say, look, I think Donald Trump should be exonerated by a jury. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  Let's have a speedy trial so that this can be put to bed before the primary and let the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  president be vindicated. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=158.1s)]
*  You don't have to say he's guilty. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=159.73999999999998s)]
*  You could actually say you think he would be acquitted. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=160.77999999999997s)]
*  I think that's that conversation has yet to emerge in Republican politics. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  DeSantis is the type of person that could actually lead that conversation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=167.82s)]
*  That's all that's all interesting and well said. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=172.26s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that's notable here and I should I always say this, right, like [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=174.62s)]
*  when we were doing polling in 2015 of June, it was like Jeb Bush over Scott Walker, like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=178.54s)]
*  all this so early and and like, who knows, maybe, you know, maybe we have covid twenty [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=182.62s)]
*  twenty three in the fall and everything goes apart. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=188.18s)]
*  So we don't know what the future brings. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=190.78s)]
*  The point, though, is that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=193.82s)]
*  The favorability issue to me just speaks to like what he is trying to do right now, which [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=196.54s)]
*  it doesn't seem it's it's not clear to me what he is trying to do, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=203.5s)]
*  Like he it's like you're not gaining with anyone right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=207.14s)]
*  You're only losing people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=210.34s)]
*  So you alienate Trump people. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=211.42s)]
*  But that's sort of it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=213.22s)]
*  It's like I don't I don't quite understand the strategy here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=214.14s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, so a reminder, Ron DeSantis and I ran against each other for over a year for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=217.7s)]
*  the U.S. Senate in 2016. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=221.82s)]
*  In fact, I led him for over a year and then Marco Rubio got back into the Senate race [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=223.42s)]
*  and pushed us both out. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=228.26s)]
*  So I know his candidacy pretty well, his political character pretty well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=229.22s)]
*  He is an angry person. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=234.26s)]
*  And that begins to come out just today in Florida. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=236.5s)]
*  He vetoed the Senate projects of a state senator who had endorsed Donald Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=239.82s)]
*  Now, look, we all understand the give and take. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=245.26s)]
*  And if you're not with me, maybe I'll veto your projects. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  But this is Republican on Republican crime, if you will. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=249.86s)]
*  And Ron DeSantis needs friends, not enemies. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  He's losing the primary. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  He's not winning it. So this was a losing candidate flexing his strength, making one [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=256.38s)]
*  more enemy in Republican politics. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=261.18s)]
*  And it speaks to his overall kind of angry caricature that he's created for himself in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  the GOP primary. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=268.38s)]
*  I want to ask you about this loyalty pledge situation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=270.66s)]
*  So you've got you know, there's this loyalty pledge. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=273.14s)]
*  You got a pledge that you'll support the eventual nominee. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  This was born back in 2015, 2016, when they thought Trump would bolt. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=277.14s)]
*  They all signed it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=281.3s)]
*  This is what Asa Hutchinson is saying in light of Donald Trump's indictment for his [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=283.3s)]
*  handling of classified documents. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=286.94s)]
*  Former Arkansas owner Asa Hutchinson's campaign on Wednesday requested a meeting with [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=288.7s)]
*  R&C officials about amending the loyalty pledge. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=292.46s)]
*  During the brief call, R&C leaders declined to make any changes to debate requirements [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=295.06s)]
*  until the Stafford committee is not dealing with hypotheticals on Trump's legal fate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  One of the individuals with knowledge of the call described it as contentious. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=302.5s)]
*  Apparently, Asa Hutchinson wanted to add a clause that you did not have to support [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=305.26s)]
*  the nominee if they were convicted of a felony. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=309.14s)]
*  And R&C was having none of that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=313.78s)]
*  But again, like any time you actually say it out loud, it reminds you of what a ludicrous [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=315.26s)]
*  situation the Republican Party is walking into right now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=320.82s)]
*  A remarkable moment for the National Republican Party. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=324.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm a little surprised, Chris, and I realize this requires an alliance of competitors. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=327.74s)]
*  But this is an issue where all of the presidential candidates could actually agree with Asa [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  Hutchinson. And this is where you could say, we actually think Donald Trump could be [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=337.38s)]
*  exonerated on the law. Let's have a trial. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=341.18s)]
*  But at the end of the day, if he's convicted, it is not the right candidate for our party. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=343.14000000000004s)]
*  Don't ask me to support him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=347.22s)]
*  Right. I mean, look, what I'm looking for is that effect that it happens slowly and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=349.1s)]
*  then all at once. At the first August primary debate, at the first debate in August, do [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=353.86s)]
*  we see all the candidates actually have some type of similar statement, joint statement? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=358.78s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. And that's a that's a condemnation for the candidate. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  Finally, there's just to me the continuing fact that Donald Trump is not popular with [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=369.14s)]
*  voters. He's not getting more popular with voters the more he gets indicted. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=375.58s)]
*  And when you look at these focus groups of Biden voters who disapprove of Joe Biden, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=379.38s)]
*  the low hanging fruit, the persuadable folks you want to aim at if you're a Republican [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=385.61999999999995s)]
*  Party, they can say whatever they want about Joe Biden. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=389.26s)]
*  In the end, you say, what about Trump? They're like, absolutely not. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=391.61999999999995s)]
*  And that to me is just the ground political fact that I just don't understand why more [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=393.94s)]
*  people in the Republican Party don't see. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=397.9s)]
*  Yeah, look, we're talking about Republican leaders in Washington and Republican voters. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=400.58s)]
*  Donald Trump created a cultural movement and decided to park it in today's Republican [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=404.09999999999997s)]
*  Party. I think the biggest gamble of all is Donald Trump is hoping to land the actual [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=408.29999999999995s)]
*  trial after the early primary date in February and March. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=412.94s)]
*  The biggest gamble for the country is exactly the same because if Donald Trump wins the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=417.9s)]
*  GOP primary, the nation is likely saved another term of Donald Trump or a Republican [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=422.14s)]
*  light Donald Trump because Joe Biden beats him. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9vaQuLCCw8&t=426.82s)]
