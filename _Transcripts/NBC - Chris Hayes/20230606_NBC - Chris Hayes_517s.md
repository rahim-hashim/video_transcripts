# Trump's former attorney on the likelihood of Trump indictment
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0)
*  As we await potential indictment of the former president of the United States, we now have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=0.0s)]
*  what we believe to be the first ever recorded exchange with the man who's investigating [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=3.72s)]
*  him, special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=8.26s)]
*  NBC News reporter Gary Grumbach managed to intercept him outside his office this morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=10.52s)]
*  You can see the special counsel on your screen there holding onto a Subway sandwich bag as [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=15.48s)]
*  he walks back to his office. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=19.52s)]
*  Here's the exchange. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Hey there, Mr. Smith, how are you doing? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Gary Grumbach from NBC News here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=24.92s)]
*  Here's an indictment coming soon, sir. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=27.36s)]
*  Here's an investigation wrapping up, sir. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=32.28s)]
*  Excuse us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=41.32s)]
*  Anything you'd like to say, Mr. Smith? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  The answer to that is no. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=47.72s)]
*  Smith is tight lipped, as he should be. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=48.92s)]
*  We can't expect any public pronouncements until there is an indictment, if there is one. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=51.84s)]
*  Although current indications point in that direction. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=56.52s)]
*  Yesterday, Donald Trump's attorneys met with Jack Smith himself for roughly two hours [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=60.92s)]
*  after they requested and did not get a sit down with Attorney General Merrick Garland. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=65.08s)]
*  That meeting seems to have irked the ex-president mere minutes after it wrapped up, Trump was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=70.48s)]
*  wailing about the possibility of an indictment on his social media platform. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  Quote, all caps, how can DOJ possibly charge me who did nothing wrong? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=78.64s)]
*  And on and on and on and on it went. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  New York Times even reported that Trump expects to face charges, according to people who have [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=85.56s)]
*  spoken to him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=89.56s)]
*  Timothy Pallatore recently left Donald Trump's legal team handling the special counsel cases, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=95.68s)]
*  Good to have you here. I guess you have been you've said you wouldn't be surprised if he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=97.68s)]
*  were not indicted up until now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  And I just wonder if the developments of the last few days, and particularly the meeting [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=104.92s)]
*  with DOJ, changes how you're thinking about that likelihood. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=108.36s)]
*  Well, look, obviously, I have no idea what happened inside that meeting. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=111.4s)]
*  But, you know, I evaluate this case based on what I know to be the facts and the law, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=115.04s)]
*  as opposed to just what's been publicly reported. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=121.2s)]
*  And so my opinion as a lawyer is that this is something that shouldn't result in charges. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=123.56s)]
*  However, you know, will it result in charges? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=129.36s)]
*  You know, that's that's kind of up in the air. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=132.16s)]
*  A lot of that goes down to what the prosecutors decide to do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=135.28s)]
*  When you say shouldn't, I've seen some of your previous interviews about this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=138.32s)]
*  I guess the sort of core question I have, like I've been I've been in a civil case, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=143.12s)]
*  right, where someone says, you know, you got to hold documents for discovery. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=149.0s)]
*  And, you know, people take that very seriously. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=152.08s)]
*  And these aren't like natural sensitive, national security stuff. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=154.08s)]
*  It's just like, make sure you and go and search your email and furnish it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=157.12s)]
*  I just feel like if I did that and then like four more times, I was like, oh, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=160.36s)]
*  I would probably be in pretty big trouble, like independent of whether I got charged or anything. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=165.56s)]
*  It just seems like that basic fact pattern is is not something you generally want your client [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=169.48s)]
*  doing in any situation having to do with the providing of documents. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=174.2s)]
*  Sure. I mean, in retrospect, you can certainly take issue with the manner in which the initial [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=181.72s)]
*  searches were conducted and the way that the search was conducted. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, one thing that I've always looked at with that is that the when the subpoena first came out [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=191.16s)]
*  and Evan asked for additional time, they gave him a little bit of time, but not as much as he had asked for. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=197.0s)]
*  And then he did the search that he did and gave them whatever he found within that period of time. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=203.0s)]
*  See, ordinarily, what happens is, you know, when I'm dealing with the U.S. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=209.72s)]
*  attorney's office and I say, look, I need more time, they'll say, look, I need more time. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=213.0s)]
*  They'll say, look, give us what you can by that date, but we want you to keep searching there after. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=218.52s)]
*  We recognize that this is going to be a much larger thing. So keep doing it on a rolling basis. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=225.48s)]
*  And that that didn't happen here. You know, they gave them, you know, they gave them an extra week [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=230.28s)]
*  and they said, you know, give us everything you find by that date. And they kind of cut it off right there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=234.2s)]
*  But they also which was weird. Well, but there's two parts of that, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=239.0s)]
*  I mean, the timeline here is pretty long. The guy leaves in January 2021. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=242.12s)]
*  He's not really giving over anything except for those 15 boxes almost a year later. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=246.76s)]
*  Then the subpoena comes happens months after that. Then the meeting happens after that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=250.76s)]
*  So this is not like an overnight situation. That seems like a long amount of time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=254.12s)]
*  Well, the time that I'm specifically talking about is in between the issuance of the subpoena and the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=260.36s)]
*  compliance date. You know, all of the stuff that happened before that is, you know, when there is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=264.92s)]
*  no sort of investigation really there. Well, it's relevant, but it has to be examined under [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=269.8s)]
*  the Presidential Records Act and what the ordinary procedures are on a transition. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=276.2s)]
*  Right. But then the other thing about this is so whether the compliance timeline was weird or not, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  the thing that also strikes me, you've got three or four asks, right, for documents. Some are asks, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=289.08s)]
*  some are compulsory, right? Some are here's a subpoena, right? And each time you don't get the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=294.84s)]
*  full you don't get all of them. And we know that as a matter of fact, that's just, you know, that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=301.08s)]
*  those are the facts. The question about whether the reason for that. But at one point you get an [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=305.0s)]
*  attestation signed by a lawyer being like we've we've searched high and low and this is as best we [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=311.08s)]
*  could tell this is everything. And then you get a search by the FBI with like 100 more docs. It's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=315.32s)]
*  just like, well, that someone was wrong. Someone screwed this up. Yeah. Well, and you know, the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=319.48s)]
*  certification that was given at the time, you know, was largely a form, a standard form [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=326.68s)]
*  certification saying a diligent search has been conducted and, you know, here are responsive [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=331.8s)]
*  documents. Right. You know, in retrospect, you know, could you sit here and say, you know, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  maybe it would have been smarter to say all responsive documents that were found [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  are attached. Yeah, I don't think that in the ordinary course of things, you know, that is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=345.32s)]
*  kind of what prosecutors of the other side would understand it to be. You know, so, you know, he [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=350.6s)]
*  did use a standard form for that. I think that, you know, had there been a lot more cooperation [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=356.28s)]
*  on both sides, you know, I'm not saying anything about, you know, Mr. Quirkren here, but I think [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=363.23999999999995s)]
*  that definitely in the ordinary course, you would have more cooperation communications, not only from [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=367.64s)]
*  the defense, but also from the DOJ side. And I think that the matter, really the matter which [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  these communications happened, it led to that. Let me play William Barbe making a somewhat similar [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=380.52s)]
*  point. He's making it more about the Trump folks. So basically, this was avoidable if they just [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=385.96s)]
*  handed stuff over. Take a listen. Based on the facts, as the facts come out, I think over time, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=390.68s)]
*  people will see that this is not a case of the Department of Justice, you know, conducting a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=397.0s)]
*  witch hunt. In fact, they approached this very delicately and with deference to the president. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=401.88s)]
*  And this would have gone nowhere had the president just returned the documents. But he jerked them [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  around for a year and a half. And the question is, did he deceive them? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=410.76s)]
*  I mean, whether it's criminal or not, jerk them around for a year and a half does feel like it's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=415.24s)]
*  the facts. I don't know if that's chargeable, but it seems like a fair lay description of what went on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=420.36s)]
*  And a fairly uninformed one, unfortunately, because really we're talking about multiple [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=427.4s)]
*  phases here. We're talking about the initial discussions between the president and the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=431.8s)]
*  National Archives, where he has the two years in which to review these documents. They wanted them [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=436.2s)]
*  sooner. And a lot of this comes down to the fact that the National Archives failed to get a facility [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=440.92s)]
*  in Palm Beach to store these documents as they have for every other former president since the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=445.8s)]
*  passing of the Presidential Records Act. They wanted all the boxes immediately returned back [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=450.52s)]
*  up to D.C. where he wouldn't have ready access to them to be able to review them as every other [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  president has. And that point, yes, that point. You have to kind of separate. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=460.36s)]
*  But let me just say this. There are different phases. There's that administrative discussion. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=465.24s)]
*  Yes. The question, there's a question here of like, oh, did I miss these documents? Or like, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=469.48s)]
*  oh, no, no, I want these documents. Those two, you can argue in the alternative because you're a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=474.04s)]
*  lawyer and that's what you do. But those two are in some logical tension. It's not like, oh, I miss, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  I miss, I meant to give you guys, I didn't have it. It's like, no, no, I want this document near [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=483.0s)]
*  me. And if you look at what Trump says, it seems like a lot of it was that latter [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=487.32s)]
*  category, Tim Parlatory, who served as an attorney for the president. Thanks for joining us. I appreciate it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=491.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerzX0Zjry0&t=517.32s)]
