# The Supreme Court just ‘tipped the scales’ for House Republicans
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are in a race against the clock, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=0.0s)]
*  ticking ever closer to Election Day, as Donald Trump desperately tries to delay any effort to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=3.6s)]
*  hold him accountable for his actions. Now, at least in New York, it looks like his efforts [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=8.32s)]
*  have been unsuccessful, with a Manhattan judge ruling this week that Trump's hush-money election [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=12.48s)]
*  interference trial will start on April 15th. Although the ex-president continues to put up [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=17.44s)]
*  a fight, attacking the judge's daughter continuously, now challenging the gag order [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  imposed on him, we will talk about all of that tonight. And yet, in the other three criminal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=28.16s)]
*  cases against him, our legal system continues to move in slow motion, crucially in the most serious [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=33.36s)]
*  and most important case about Donald Trump's attempted coup leading up to January 6th. In [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=40.0s)]
*  that case, the Supreme Court has basically suspended any forward motion while they take up Trump's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=45.44s)]
*  extremely dubious claim that he is immune from any potential prosecution because he was president [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=51.28s)]
*  at the time. Whether Donald Trump will face trial for trying to overthrow our democracy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=57.36s)]
*  before the next election is now, let me be clear here, entirely up to the court and the majority of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=63.04s)]
*  the court and how quickly they move. The key thing to understand, and this cannot be emphasized enough, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=69.44s)]
*  is that when the Supreme Court wants to move fast, they move fast. And when they want to move slow, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=76.16s)]
*  they move very slow. In both circumstances, they know exactly what they're doing and what [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=82.24s)]
*  the effects will be. They're not idiots. And by they, I mean the conservative majority of the court [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  that controls such matters. This week, we saw a stark example of that. When the Supreme Court [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=94.64s)]
*  tipped the scales in the race for control of the House towards Republicans by sitting on their [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  hands and just doing nothing. This comes in a case out of South Carolina. It may have escaped your [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  notice. It hasn't gotten a lot of attention where the Republican-controlled legislature in that state [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  drew this map in 2022, drastically changing the makeup of two congressional districts, the first [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=118.0s)]
*  district and the sixth district. And early last year, a three-judge federal district judge court [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  panel ruled the map was unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered, having moved over 30,000 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=130.16s)]
*  African-American voters from the first district to the sixth. As you can see with these lines, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=137.44s)]
*  the voting population of the first district was just 17.4% black versus 46.9% in the sixth district. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, to be clear here, this gets confusing with the map. The purpose was to make the district [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=152.8s)]
*  safer for, yes, the Trumpy Republican incumbent Congresswoman Nancy Mace. This was a Nancy Mace [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=158.56s)]
*  salvation project. South Carolina Republicans who found their map struck down by federal judges [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=165.84s)]
*  were not going down without a fight. Of course, they appealed to the Supreme Court asking the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=171.68s)]
*  MAGA majority to allow their map to stand. Now, let's be clear. This is nothing new. In fact, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=175.76s)]
*  we've seen a lot of these fights over racially gerrymandered districts in recent years, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=182.08s)]
*  particularly after the Supreme Court struck down sections of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=186.08s)]
*  So one case was in Alabama where that state's Republican-controlled legislature [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=190.0s)]
*  passed this congressional map in 2021. You can see just one district, the seventh in blue, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=194.56s)]
*  was majority black. In early 2022, a federal court blocked the map, ruling that it likely [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  violated the Voting Rights Act by deliberately splitting black voters across four districts, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=207.12s)]
*  meaning that there was only one majority minority district. They told Alabama that wasn't good [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=212.88s)]
*  enough, that the Alabama legislature had to redraw the map with a second majority black district. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=218.48s)]
*  Republicans took this case to the Supreme Court as well, where the court put it on pause [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=225.04s)]
*  back in 2022, saying it was, oh, too close to the election to change the map. We don't want to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=230.32s)]
*  mess with things. Now, mind you, that was in February of 2022. The primary wasn't held until [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=234.96s)]
*  late May. And so what happened? Well, back in 2022, the state of Alabama used the racially [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=240.88s)]
*  gerrymandered maps with disenfranchised black voters and cost Democrats, the ones that had [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=247.84s)]
*  already been struck down by the lower court as unconstitutional. They used those maps, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=254.48s)]
*  and to no one's surprise, Republicans benefited because they won every district except the sole [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=259.76s)]
*  majority black district, helping to secure Republicans' tiny majority in the House. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=266.16s)]
*  Now, here's the kicker. After the election was over, the Supreme Court got around to ruling on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=272.16s)]
*  the case and ruled five to four that, oh, wow, look at that. Alabama's map did violate the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=277.36s)]
*  Voting Rights Act and would have to be redrawn. The state of Alabama did discriminate against [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=282.72s)]
*  its black voters, and they held a whole election using the discriminatory map because the Supreme [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=289.12s)]
*  Court would not make a decision nearly four months ahead of any votes being cast. Okay? This [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=294.72s)]
*  happened in 2022 in Alabama. So that brings us back to South Carolina, the current litigation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  In that case, the Supreme Court did actually hear arguments on that case all the way back in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  October, October 11th. That was more than five months ago. That was when the court heard the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=312.88000000000005s)]
*  South Carolina case. At that point, the 2023 World Series had not yet begun. Yesterday was the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=318.32s)]
*  opening day of the 2024 season when the court heard the South Carolina case, George Santos. Remember [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=324.96s)]
*  that guy? He was still a member of Congress. Remember, they move quickly when they want to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=330.56s)]
*  move quickly. When they wanted to strike down COVID restrictions or end the Biden administration's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=336.08s)]
*  moratorium on evictions or make sure that student borrowers didn't get debt relief, they moved at [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=341.36s)]
*  lightning speed. But in this case, well, they've just been sitting on this case about South [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=346.64s)]
*  Carolina's maps. No word from them, making no decisions for five months now. And the congressional [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=352.0s)]
*  primary is fast approaching on June 11th. So guess what is going to happen? We are following some [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=358.8s)]
*  breaking news at this hour. A United States Circuit Court judge has made an important ruling on the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=365.12s)]
*  first congressional district's political boundaries. The judge has ruled that the current boundaries [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=370.0s)]
*  will be used for this year's elections. Now, the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court where [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=375.04s)]
*  we are still waiting on a decision. Meanwhile, opponents asked a judge to hold this year's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=380.24s)]
*  elections using the pre 2020 boundaries. The judge writes it would be highly inconvenient and unusual [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=385.6s)]
*  to try to change district boundaries ahead of the June primary. You get that? They didn't make a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  decision. The Supreme Court, they just ran out the clock. They just didn't do anything. And then it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=399.92s)]
*  got so close to the election that they're going to go ahead and use the South Carolina map, the map [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=405.68s)]
*  that the lower court judges evaluated and said was racist and unconstitutional because the Supreme [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=411.2s)]
*  Court just couldn't get motivated enough to hit any deadlines and rule on the case. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=417.44s)]
*  The Supreme Court knows what it's doing. The justices know what they're doing. These aren't [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=423.12s)]
*  freshmen in their first few weeks of college overwhelmed by assignments trying to figure out [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=427.12s)]
*  how to get it all done. This was not an oversight. The justices know that if they don't act, the maps [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=432.64s)]
*  stay in place. And the conservative majority knows that the current map will favor the Republican [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=439.28s)]
*  Party and that if it's changed, it will favor the Democrats. So by not acting, the map is going to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=444.4s)]
*  So by not acting, they have acted. By delaying, they have made something in the world happen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=451.28s)]
*  They think they are very clever. They think they can get away with it because no one is paying [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=459.6s)]
*  attention. But we are paying attention. We see what they're doing. We know the conservative [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=465.04s)]
*  majority of the Supreme Court decided to let black voters continue to be discriminated against in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=472.4s)]
*  South Carolina this year in violation of the Constitution. It seems to me that this is exactly [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=479.52s)]
*  parallel to what they are right now as I speak to you trying to do with Donald Trump's case. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=485.84s)]
*  They waited two whole weeks after Trump petitioned to announce that they would take the case. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=491.28s)]
*  They then scheduled the case for the last possible day of oral arguments, April 25th. And then, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=495.68s)]
*  if they sit on it long enough, well, it could basically just go away. It could be too late [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=502.56s)]
*  to hold the trial before the election. And then once the issue is moot, the court could come out [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=509.12s)]
*  and rule on the merits and get credit for making the right call. He's not immune. It's too late [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=515.12s)]
*  for it to really matter. Just like they did in the Alabama case after the election, after the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=519.12s)]
*  Republicans had already secured a House majority by a very narrow number. Maybe they will do the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  same thing in South Carolina too. Who knows? Find the Map actually did violate the Constitution, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=530.4s)]
*  actually was an illegal racist gerrymander after it's too late. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=535.44s)]
*  Maybe they will find Donald Trump is not immune, but not in trying to try him before the election. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  If I sound frustrated and angry, it's because I am. There's not a lot of recourse here with [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=547.44s)]
*  this court. The only recourse we have with this court is to do this, to shine a light on the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=553.2s)]
*  behavior and make sure they know that we know exactly what they are up to. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owfVBLSs_Bs&t=558.24s)]
