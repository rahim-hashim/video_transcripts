# ‘That’s it?’: Hayes blasts Trump coup lawyers’ apology letters to Georgia
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks)
*  So, as we just reported, Rudy Giuliani has been ordered to pay two Georgia election workers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=0.0s)]
*  nearly $150 million after a court found him liable for defaming them as he spread Donald [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=5.44s)]
*  Trump's big lie. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=11.48s)]
*  And what really sunk Rudy here, apart from his, well, obvious guilt, was his refusal [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=12.92s)]
*  to publicly acknowledge what he did or apologize for his obvious and cruel wrongdoing, which, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=17.52s)]
*  of course, is in keeping with the MAGA ethos. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=22.48s)]
*  But public apologies for January 6th and the big lie are actually really important for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=26.2s)]
*  the country's political health. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=30.08s)]
*  Tens of millions of people still believe Trump won in 2020. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=32.0s)]
*  He is currently running on that platform, basically, to finish the job he started on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=36.08s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=40.44s)]
*  And it's crucial that those responsible for the attempted coup are held accountable for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=42.04s)]
*  their behavior and ideally state plainly and clearly, publicly, that the election was not [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=45.84s)]
*  stolen and what they did to try to overturn it was wrong. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=52.14s)]
*  On the lowest rungs of the ladder, we often see this with the members of the insurrectionist [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=57.42s)]
*  mob who were later charged. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=60.94s)]
*  There's been dozens, hundreds of them, like a man named Daniel Caldwell, one example. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  He's a former Marine who pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement officers with a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=67.74s)]
*  dangerous weapon after he used chemical spray against police officers on January 6th. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=71.78s)]
*  During a cheerful apology in court, Caldwell said, quote, I must face my actions head on, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=77.9s)]
*  according to the officers he assaulted. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=82.78s)]
*  Quote, I hope that you and your country never have to face another day like January 6th. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  And even when it comes to coup plotters higher up in the scheme, like the defendants in Trump's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=92.54s)]
*  Georgia racketeering case, we have seen some seemingly genuine contrition. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=97.54s)]
*  If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=103.62s)]
*  post-election challenges. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=108.22s)]
*  I look back on this whole experience with deep remorse. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=109.78s)]
*  It was Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis during her guilty plea earlier this year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=113.54s)]
*  There's also a bail bondsman named Scott Hall, who was part of the election interference [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  scheme that helped break into a voting machine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=121.78s)]
*  He wrote a letter to the judge where he apologized for his role in the plot and he took responsibility [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=124.62s)]
*  for his actions. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=129.02s)]
*  But the other two Trump confederates who pleaded guilty were not so contrite. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=131.18s)]
*  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution received each of their letters to the judge in that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  case, part of the condition of their plea, and I will read them both in full. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=140.22s)]
*  From coup lawyer Sydney Powell, quote, I apologize for my actions in connection with the events [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=143.94s)]
*  in Coffee County. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=149.34s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=151.62s)]
*  Here's what we got from her fellow coup plotter Kenneth Chesbrough, quote, I apologize to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=153.1s)]
*  the citizens of the state of Georgia and Fulton County for my involvement in count [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=157.38s)]
*  15 of the indictment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=160.74s)]
*  He doesn't even say what he did. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=162.26s)]
*  It's never been more obvious that those few people do not regret their actions in the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=166.42s)]
*  slightest, except perhaps insofar as they got caught. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=170.98s)]
*  And one of the lessons here is that you simply cannot let people like Trump and his allies [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=173.5s)]
*  determine their own accountability because they simply will never do it on their own. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=176.38s)]
*  They have to be brought to account by the full force of the law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=181.14s)]
*  Shan Wu is a former federal prosecutor, served as counsel to Attorney General Janet Reno. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=186.42s)]
*  Josh Marshall wrote about these, quote, really sorry letters for Talking Points Memo, where [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  he is the founder and editor in chief, and they both join me now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=195.26s)]
*  Josh, I don't, I've never, we lost you maybe, so I'll go to you, Shan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  Shan, first of all, in your experience doing this kind of thing, is it common for someone [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=206.1s)]
*  on a plea to give such a obviously truculent F-U to the entire proceedings in their apology? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=214.1s)]
*  No, this is like the I'm sorry you're ugly kind of apology. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=221.42s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=225.7s)]
*  It's very transparent. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=226.7s)]
*  And usually the defendant wants to take that moment to convince the judge who's going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=227.7s)]
*  sentence them that they are genuinely remorseful and they have learned something from this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=232.54s)]
*  And in this case, it really seems that the defendants don't have that concern at all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  And obviously their plea structure gives them some solidity as to what they could, what's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=242.94s)]
*  the worst case scenario. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=247.7s)]
*  But honestly, I mean, if I were that judge, I wouldn't even accept that as having been [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=249.54s)]
*  the apology. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=253.34s)]
*  And the prosecutor should take the same tactic, should be like a school teacher saying, go [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=254.34s)]
*  back and try it again. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=258.26s)]
*  That was going to be my next question, because I really like, I think this is wholly unacceptable [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=259.26s)]
*  at a bunch of different levels. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=263.82s)]
*  First of all, these are wealthy, privileged, affluent people who are getting to do a thing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=264.98s)]
*  that that hundreds of thousands of Americans who are run through the plea system, you know, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=269.76s)]
*  every month in this country don't get to do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=275.36s)]
*  But also because stating that you were wrong about the specifics of what happened is important [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=278.4s)]
*  for the country's civic health and a huge part of why this is a meaningful prosecution. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=285.36s)]
*  So so you're saying the judge can be like, not good enough. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=289.2s)]
*  Try again. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know the judge could say plea deals off because of this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  But if part of the plea deal is the apology, I think the judge can say, hey, you're not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=298.86s)]
*  fulfilling that aspect of the plea deal. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=301.98s)]
*  And obviously, the reason here for an apology, you know, lots of cases, you know, people [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  get convicted without an apology. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=308.86s)]
*  But just like what you're saying, the critical point here is the harm done to the public [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=310.82s)]
*  and to our system and their acknowledgement is really critical. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=316.42s)]
*  And too often, you know, there's this built in kind of bias in favor of white collar defendants [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  because it's not a violent crime. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=323.5s)]
*  They get treated more lightly. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=325.68s)]
*  But these folks use, just like you're saying, their prestige, their power to abuse the system [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  and hurt the country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  And they really do need to be held accountable for that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=334.6s)]
*  Josh, I am not generally a sort of wrathful person. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not like usually not how I go through life. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=341.68s)]
*  But I like I really felt like I hit the roof when I saw those yesterday. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=344.0s)]
*  And I think you felt the same way because they are such an insult. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=348.6s)]
*  After all of this to do that, it's like a you can't touch me kind of thing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=351.96s)]
*  Yeah, there were there were so many layers of it because, you know, Mr. Hall's letter, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=358.96s)]
*  he's the bail bondsman you mentioned, was released in the same group of documents. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=364.0s)]
*  And his is five paragraphs long. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=368.96s)]
*  It you know, pretty basic. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  I thought I was doing the right thing when it happened. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=374.2s)]
*  But I see now I'm wrong. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=376.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Blah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, OK, you know, we sort of assume someone is being sincere. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=380.16s)]
*  But in the case of these two, a one sentence, not even really mentioning what they did. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  And then it's this additional level, which is hard to say substantive, but somehow brings [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  it all together, which is that it's it's like, you know, a workshop project, you know, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=398.72s)]
*  project in second grade, you know, Dick and Jane's first plea negotiation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=405.56s)]
*  What is this like even like Shezbrows? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=410.12s)]
*  It's it's like, you know, it's like it's like a five year old. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=412.36s)]
*  And these are this is a guy who went to Harvard Law School. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  And, you know, both of them are career long, successful attorneys. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  It's just weird. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=426.16s)]
*  And when I saw it, I didn't know what to make of it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it in every way, it seems to communicate FU to everybody, to the state of Georgia, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  to the people of Georgia, to the prosecutor. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=439.68s)]
*  It's it's kind of wild. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=442.44s)]
*  And there's one other aspect of this, because I think about like, you know, what's what is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=444.04s)]
*  punishment for? Right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  I think coming back to this in these cases sort of like, you know, criminal criminal [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=449.2s)]
*  philosophy of crime 101. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=453.76s)]
*  Right. Like it's like, you know, we want we you know, we want some sort of accountability. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  Right. We want some sort of acknowledgment of the harm in a social sense. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=461.24s)]
*  One of the things we also want is deterrence. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=464.48s)]
*  And like I read those two things and I am not convinced, Josh, that these two aren't going to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  just like get back on the train for twenty twenty four to go plot again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=472.32000000000005s)]

*  And yeah, yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=480.56s)]

*  And and something like this kind of communicates in a very basic way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=505.8s)]
*  And it's a big deal because they're the big public people. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=511.12s)]
*  No one knows who Scott Hall is. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=514.08s)]

*  I'm going to, you know, I'm going to be on probation, but whatever, I do it again. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=522.52s)]

*  It's just I'm very I mean, my impression was and this may be I guess the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  these the deals are not finalized until the case, you know, until other aspects of the case [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=541.92s)]
*  come forward. But we haven't heard anything that the judge was like saying, OK, forget [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTZsh7l8Ks&t=546.72s)]
