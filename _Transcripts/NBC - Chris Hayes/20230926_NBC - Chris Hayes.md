# ‘It’s a shame’ Ron Klain knocks ‘dysfunction’ of House Republican caucus
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E)
*  The House MAGA caucus now appears to be getting their way. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=0.0s)]
*  After tanking a bunch of votes in highly humiliating fashion last week, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=3.0s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is negotiating with the far-right caucus [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=7.0s)]
*  to pass a spending bill that has no hope of becoming law. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=10.0s)]
*  But it would achieve the crucial objective and an 80% cut to Title I, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=14.0s)]
*  annihilating one of the most important federal programs for low-income schools. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=19.0s)]
*  Eighty percent! [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=23.0s)]
*  And not just that, it would also cut more than a million mothers and children [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=24.0s)]
*  from nutrition aid slash spending on home heating aid by 70% just ahead of winter [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=27.0s)]
*  and much more. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=32.0s)]
*  McCarthy has said his far-right members want to burn it all down, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=34.0s)]
*  and that's true to a certain extent they do. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=37.0s)]
*  But with four days until a shutdown, do not lose sight of the fact that in the end [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=39.0s)]
*  they do apparently have a policy objective. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=42.0s)]
*  What they always want to do, which always seems to be to visit suffering on people, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=45.0s)]
*  particularly the most vulnerable. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=50.0s)]
*  Ron Klain is former White House Chief of Staff for President Biden, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=52.0s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=55.0s)]
*  I had to chuck a little bit today when Kevin McCarthy, after failing to even whip his own caucus [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=56.0s)]
*  on the rule before the vote, losing that twice for the first time in like 20 years, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=61.0s)]
*  said that the solution to the shutdown was to talk to President Biden. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=67.0s)]
*  What do you make of what's going on in the House and what it's going to mean for the country? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=70.0s)]
*  Well, look, Chris, I mean, I think you hear people in Washington say all the time, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=76.0s)]
*  I wish there was more bipartisanship. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=79.0s)]
*  But in fact, there is a bipartisan agreement between President Biden and the Senate, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=81.0s)]
*  which passed a key vote in the Senate with 77 senators, vast majority of Republicans, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=85.0s)]
*  vast majority of Democrats, to keep the government open, to fund the war in Ukraine, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=90.0s)]
*  and to help people with disaster relief. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=94.0s)]
*  So I had overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=96.0s)]
*  So the problem isn't the Democrats or Republicans can't get along, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=98.0s)]
*  it's that House Republicans can't get along. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=101.0s)]
*  President Biden kind of deal with them about government spending when he averted the debt crisis, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=103.0s)]
*  and now the Republicans in the House don't want to stick to the deal that they made, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=108.0s)]
*  they want to start all over again and close the government down. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=111.0s)]
*  This just shows the dysfunction of the House Republican caucus. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=114.0s)]
*  And on the other hand, you can see the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate can work together, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=116.0s)]
*  make progress, and it's a shame to see what's going on in the House right now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=120.0s)]
*  The president, we just showed a clip of him on the picket line today in Michigan, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=124.0s)]
*  the striking United Auto Workers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=129.0s)]
*  Stephen Ratner, who worked on the auto rescue under the Obama administration, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=131.0s)]
*  said it was a bad idea. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=136.0s)]
*  He thought the president was doing the wrong thing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=138.0s)]
*  He's putting the sum on the scale. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=139.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=140.0s)]
*  Look, I saw President Biden in New York last week when he was up there for the U.N. General Assembly, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=142.0s)]
*  and he said to me, Ron, I'm going to go to Detroit and march in the picket line. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=146.0s)]
*  And I said, well, of course, John, Mr. President, that's who you are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=150.0s)]
*  That's who you've always been. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=152.0s)]
*  We saw that it was Joe Biden being Joe Biden. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=153.0s)]
*  He's been to picket lines many times as a senator. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=155.0s)]
*  It's his first time as president. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=158.0s)]
*  But this is who he is. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=159.0s)]
*  As he said today, you've heard him say it before, you know, he says Wall Street didn't build this country, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=160.0s)]
*  middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=165.0s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden believes in the core of his being. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=168.0s)]
*  People heard him say it today in Detroit. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=171.0s)]
*  And of course, that's where he's going to be. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=173.0s)]
*  I want to show this. I thought this chart on auto worker job creation over the last several presidents. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=175.0s)]
*  Pretty interesting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=180.0s)]
*  Jim Tankersley tweeted this out earlier. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=181.0s)]
*  Good economic reporter. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=183.0s)]
*  This is the created under recent presidents. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=185.0s)]
*  This is I think a per month average basically over the term of their president. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=188.0s)]
*  So you see Clinton plus 1800 George Bush minus almost 6000 plus 200, 2800 Obama Trump pre covid plus 200. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=192.0s)]
*  Trump total minus 200 Biden plus 4000. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=200.0s)]
*  I mean, do you think that registers? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=204.0s)]
*  Well, I think it registers with auto workers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=209.0s)]
*  And I think I think everyone Americans, they saw their president stand up, stand up working people and say, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=211.0s)]
*  as Steve Granhouse said, that we've been through a period in our country where the corporate leaders have done very well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=216.0s)]
*  They've made a lot of money. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=221.0s)]
*  And the people who are actually who are actually creating that wealth, the workers deserve to share in that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=222.0s)]
*  Particularly in the auto industry where the people who are out there on strike, they all took big pay cuts with the auto industry was in trouble in 2009. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=227.0s)]
*  They agreed to help save the auto industry by cutting their pay in bad times. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=234.0s)]
*  Now that the industry is making record profits, they deserve to share in those profits and get their just rewards for having sacrificed to save the American auto industry. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=238.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtM9QsSUY0E&t=256.0s)]
