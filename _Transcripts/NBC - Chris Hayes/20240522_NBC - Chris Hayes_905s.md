# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 21
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well after five weeks the first criminal trial of a former US president is nearly over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=0.0s)]
*  The defense rested this morning. It called only two witnesses [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=7.32s)]
*  Despite all his Bravo and insistences to the contrary [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=11.68s)]
*  Yeah, Donald Trump was not one of them. I mean we knew that right [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=16.16s)]
*  Instead we heard briefly from a paralegal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=20.68s)]
*  Attorney Todd Blanch's firm about phone records before a man by the name of Robert Costello took the stand [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=23.68s)]
*  Now Costello is a former federal prosecutor a very close associate of Rudy Giuliani [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=30.64s)]
*  The twice indicted former mayor of New York City will have more about him later in the show [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=36.72s)]
*  And also Donald Trump's personal attorney while he's in the White House Giuliani that is I think it is fair to say that Costello's testimony this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=41.04s)]
*  week backfired on the defense though how much remains to be determined. But Trump's attorney's main reason to put that man Robert Costello on the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=48.04s)]
*  stand was to directly contradict and impugn the credibility of the prosecution's key witness Michael Cohen. But I got to say [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=56.48s)]
*  turns out Robert Costello might be the only person in the country who can make Michael Cohen seem even tempered by comparison. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=65.56s)]
*  Costello began his testimony yesterday acting like what can be best described as a petulant teenager rolling his eyes muttering under his breath at one point [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  saying that something would be to strike something. Of course that's not his job. That's the judge. And then after sort of crossing the judge like tried to stare him [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=81.92s)]
*  down at which point the judge was like are you staring me down. Cleared the courtroom after clearing the courtroom the judge called [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=90.92s)]
*  Costello's conduct quote contemptuous in the sort of like technical narrow sense of contempt of court and threatened to remove him on the stand and strike his [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=99.64s)]
*  testimony for the record. That man Costello again the big star witness for the defense right. The one person they're putting up returned to the stand today for cross [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=108.36s)]
*  examination. Now remember at the center of Costello's testimony is a 2018 meeting he had with Cohen. That's after Cohen had been issued a search warrant or had a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=117.4s)]
*  search warrant executed by the FBI. And as Cohen tells it he's having these back and forth with Costello who's putting a very kind of high pressure [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=127.4s)]
*  sales job on him. The implication of which was that they had to kind of keep Cohen in Trump's circle to prevent him from flipping that you know Costello was [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=135.68s)]
*  aligned with Rudy who was lying with Trump. So hire me. You'll stay in the circle. Now Costello says he was just there offers legal services. So that's the sort of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  main battle here right over over what happened. And today prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked us to quote you discuss with Cohen at that very first meeting how [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  connected you were to Rudy Giuliani. Correct. And Costello responded quote that's not true. Hoffinger then read Costello an email. Costello wrote to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=163.84s)]
*  Cohen two days after that meeting which stated and we quote here I am sure you saw the news of Rudy's joining the Trump legal team. I told you that my [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=173.96s)]
*  relationship with Rudy could be very very useful to you. Again Costello's words. The prosecutor also read an email. He wrote to a legal partner the same [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=181.68s)]
*  day not to come quote all the more reason for Cohen to hire me because of my connection to Giuliani which I mentioned to him in our meeting. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=190.44s)]
*  So again you mentioned Giuliani the first meeting. No under oath. Let me read two emails here in which you're like I mentioned Julia. OK. In further [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  communications it's clear that Costello continued to dangle his relationship with Giuliani. And again by extension Donald Trump over Cohen's head in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=209.72s)]
*  another email from Costello to Cohen. He wrote quote I spoke with Rudy. Very very positive. You are loved which I will say is sweet. Adding quote [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=217.56s)]
*  there was never a doubt that they are in our corner. Rudy says this communication channel must be maintained. And quote sleep well tonight. You have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=225.8s)]
*  friends in high places. Also sweet. PSM very positive comments about you from the White House. Now you may be thinking that the invocation of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=232.8s)]
*  Giuliani and Trump repeatedly in written communications by this man doesn't definitively prove Costello's intentions. But in a stunning example of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=240.64s)]
*  something you really don't want to put in writing prosecutors then today read another email again from Costello to that same legal partner. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=248.64s)]
*  I'm putting again our issue is to get Cohen on the right page without giving him the appearance. We are following instructions from Giuliani or [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=255.2s)]
*  the president. And I got to say when you put it like that it sure sounds like he was following instructions from Giuliani and the president [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  doesn't it. So the defense's final act there one big witness did not I think do a great job exonerating their client or even sort of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=269.88s)]
*  knocking down the credibility of the man that he was supposed to knock down Michael Cohen. Now I got to say I follow this trial very [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=278.08s)]
*  closely not as closely as some of our next guests who've been in the courtroom every day. But excuse me I find Michael Cohen on the core [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=284.68s)]
*  matters of fact that are relevant to the charges believable. That's in large part. To the due to the extensive documentation provided by all kinds [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=293.28s)]
*  of people including Robert Costello himself not to mention the lengthy paper trail outlining each step of the scheme to repaint Cohen for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=304.0s)]
*  the hush money he paid to Stormy Daniels to cover up the sexual encounter she had with Donald Trump. The attempts to hide those [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=311.0s)]
*  reimbursements in the form of bogus legal payments. The basic contours of all that like was Stormy Daniel paid did Cohen paid for it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=316.92s)]
*  Was he reimbursed. All that's not really in dispute. A week from now when closing arguments start this will all be in the hands of the jury and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=326.2s)]
*  they're going to ultimately decide the ex president's fate. Joining me now are two people inside the courthouse today MSNBC legal correspondent [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Lisa Rubin and New York Times investigative reporter Suzanne Craig. It's great to have you both here. So I miss I miss the Costello [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=341.16s)]
*  fireworks yesterday. Jen Psaki had her show on Mondays. I don't have one on Mondays. I was following it. I was even texting with Lisa being [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=346.92s)]
*  like is this is insane. So let me just go back a day because I wasn't there like the Costello experience in that courtroom. But you're not [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=352.44s)]
*  going to sell me out by reading my response. My response was beyond the Costello experience in the courtroom is a really good instructive [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  lesson on how demeanor matters because you can say all sorts of things about your misdeeds. And so long as you remain polite and contrite and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=369.8s)]
*  succinct jurors might believe you. Michael Cohen is an illustration of that. What was so bizarre is that the Robert Costello that we saw over [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=380.24s)]
*  the last couple of days reminded me of the Michael Cohen that we saw at the civil fraud trial which was exactly the fear of everyone around the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=388.0s)]
*  prosecutor's office for this trial. Right. Even to the point that in the same way that Costello said strike that or the email speaks for itself [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=395.68s)]
*  which is also something lawyers say in defense of clients for example Michael Cohen at that civil fraud trial would say from the witness [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=404.52s)]
*  stand asked and answered right. Very bombastically. So the role reversal was very telling. But I want to read you Chris another email that came [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=412.12s)]
*  out with Robert Costello today toward the end because it is maybe the worst example of how Costello was just seeking to advance Donald Trump's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=419.47999999999996s)]
*  interests and not Michael Cohen's as he swore. At one point he writes to his partner Jeff Citron who is the person who had a relationship with Cohen [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=428.67999999999995s)]
*  and introduced the two men correct and says tune into CNN and see how they are playing this up. Cohen has to know this yet he continues to slow play us [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  and the president is he totally nuts. What should I say to this blank coal. He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet. And by that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=445.36s)]
*  Costello despite his high opinion of himself didn't mean him right. He met Donald Trump. Right. We just put that we have that full [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  scream. What should I say to this. Blank hole. He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet which is like right. So the story Cohen is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=462.88s)]
*  telling is you are Donald Trump's dude and you you're there to get it. And then he's writing this. Did you. What did you think of the cross of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=469.56s)]
*  Costello. Well I just first want to give some props to the sketch artist who is in court who caught that moment. We just had it up. Yeah. Stare [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=478.84s)]
*  down. Yeah. The stare down where the judge is like whoa. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=486.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah. You don't often see. Jane Rose. Yeah. Shout out. Definitely. So what did I think of the cross examination today when when the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=489.84s)]
*  government got back up. I thought it was incredible. I mean just how she dissected him in the amount of time and just got right to those [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=502.88s)]
*  emails and just I think lay bare that he was an agent of Giuliani and Donald Trump. And no wonder Michael Cohen you know the whole the whole [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=512.16s)]
*  premise of having Costello up there was to discredit Cohen because he because Costello could come and say well he never admitted that he made [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=520.32s)]
*  these payments to me. And Michael Cohen has said I was really suspicious of this guy. Well no wonder. No wonder. I was going to say no [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=527.36s)]
*  something Sherlock. Yeah. And we should say there's one piece of testimony Costello gives that is that where he says Cohen told him I [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=535.12s)]
*  don't have anything on the press. And in some ways you know that's relevant and I can see the defense you want to get that in. Like look we [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=541.76s)]
*  talked to this guy and he he was like I got nothing. So you want to plant the seeds that he invented it later. Right. Expose facto. But given [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=548.92s)]
*  the broader contours there's two stories here about this interaction and the Cohen story again to my mind from the testimony I saw in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  that room when I was there and from the emails like the Cohen story seems to match the other evidence much better than the Costello story does. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=564.36s)]
*  Right. Is that fair. That's absolutely correct. And there's also another problem with Bob Costello story. In order to credit Bob Costello story [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  that Michael Cohen eventually lied you have to believe that he was telling the truth to Costello at some point in time which means Michael Cohen [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=579.2s)]
*  tells the truth at some points in time. Right. So it's sort of facially ridiculous at some point for Bob Costello to be Michael Cohen's a liar [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=586.48s)]
*  because his entire testimony is premised on Michael Cohen telling him the truth for some period of time. And that's going to come. You know Michael Cohen [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=595.2s)]
*  he's a liar. He's a cheat. But this case is going to come down to the jury believing at least at some point he can tell the truth. It's not binary. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=602.88s)]
*  It's not like he always lies. Correct. Yeah. They have to believe him on certain points and those are going to be points that the government is going to say [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=612.04s)]
*  that they have cooperation for. Either they have interviews or interviews or they have conversations to cooperate or they have documents because Michael Cohen [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=619.56s)]
*  is the only person who can speak to the criminal disguise of the documents. He was at all the key meetings. He is the through line. There has to be some [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=627.4799999999999s)]
*  believability on those meetings that he has spoken to. We have that incredible Alan Weisselberg the gross up document where yeah where everything sort of cooked [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=635.28s)]
*  and here's how the payments are going to work. And then Alan Weisselberg and Alan Weisselberg and Michael Cohen then go to speak to Donald Trump about it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=644.84s)]
*  We have not heard from Alan Weisselberg. He's over at Rikers where it's not been called. So we've got Michael Cohen's word on that conversation with Donald Trump [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=653.84s)]
*  where he signed off on it. It's very important and they just have to believe him on stuff where there's actually evidence. We just put it up on the screen. Yeah. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=662.24s)]
*  That may have happened. When you venture out into the world you may find yourself in a job or a community or a social setting where you will be pressured to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=669.24s)]
*  endorse ideas you don't believe or to abandon core beliefs. It will be up to you to speak out. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=679.5600000000001s)]
*  That was Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito speaking earlier this month to graduates of Franciscan University of Steubenville Ohio one of the spiritual centers of the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=687.52s)]
*  anti-abortion movement. The school consistently ranked as one of the most conservative colleges in America. Its Web site stresses time and time again how central the school [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  has been in the long movement to criminalize abortion in America since Roe v. Wade. Little do we know then that Alito's family had already lived out his advice in their [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=705.92s)]
*  own northern Virginia community right after the January 6th insurrection as the Supreme Court was considering an election case by flying the United States flag [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=715.36s)]
*  upside down on the front lawn of their house. A perversely anti patriotic symbol adopted by Donald Trump's stop the steal supporters to protest Joe Biden's [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=724.48s)]
*  victory. An open nod to the insurrectionists. That's shocking shocking behavior out of a sitting Supreme Court Justice. It's all the more shocking because Alito [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=733.6400000000001s)]
*  didn't dispute what the inverted flag stood for in an email statement to the New York Times. He just said it was his wife's idea to fly it to troll the libs in their [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  neighborhood over their own yard signs. Almost sounds like Alito was saying he found himself in a social setting being pressured to endorse ideas he didn't [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=753.16s)]
*  believe. But then the news broke about some stock trades Alito made last summer. That August there was that hokey performative right wing effort to boycott [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=761.4799999999999s)]
*  Bud Light because the company had provided a single trans influencer with one can of beer. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=770.8s)]
*  It's a little hard to remember just what a crazy cause celeb the Bud Light boycott became in the mag of fever swamps. But here let a heavily armed kid rock [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=777.64s)]
*  remind you. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=786.2s)]
*  Bud Light and Anheuser-Busch have a terrific day. Now while that boycott was raging last August according to a search of financial records by legal reporter [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzhNJ51Vo4&t=786.68s)]
