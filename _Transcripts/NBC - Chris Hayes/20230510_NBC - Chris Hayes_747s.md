# Watch All In with Chris Hayes Highlights: May 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180)
*  I want to bring in another freshman New York congressman, Democrat Daniel Goldman, released [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=0.0s)]
*  a statement shortly after the news saying, quote, it is incumbent on Speaker Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=5.72s)]
*  to eliminate the stain of Santos on this hallowed institution by removing him from Congress [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=9.46s)]
*  immediately. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=14.44s)]
*  All right, Congressman, hallowed seems a bit much. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=15.44s)]
*  You do know where you work, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=17.76s)]
*  We're regaining its hallowed nature by trying to get rid of George Santos. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=21.88s)]
*  Well, it always seemed like, it's funny. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=25.76s)]
*  This always seemed like what the game plan was from McCarthy at all was, boy, this guy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=28.28s)]
*  seems like he's in a lot of trouble. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=34.28s)]
*  We'll just wait for the Deus ex machina of the feds or some other prosecutorial entity [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  to do the job. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=40.88s)]
*  But now it's like, well, you can just keep serving. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=42.32s)]
*  You know, McCarthy has said that his standard is the Fortenberry standard. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Fortenberry, who I believe was convicted or pleaded, I can't remember to lying to federal [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=48.32s)]
*  officials, was allowed to stay until the conviction and then was asked to leave. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=53.64s)]
*  But that's a long time for George Santos to serve in Congress. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and it's completely unacceptable. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=61.04s)]
*  Look, we have to recognize here several things that Josh just mentioned, some of them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=63.52s)]
*  First, George Santos has admitted to lying about numerous representations that he made [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=68.48s)]
*  on the campaign trail. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=74.08s)]
*  Second, he has now been charged criminally, most likely, or at least there's public reporting, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=75.68s)]
*  and I would be shocked if this were not the case, related to his effort to defraud the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=81.7s)]
*  voters of his district so that he could become a member of Congress. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=86.74s)]
*  To say now that, oh, those facts, as they will be laid out in an indictment, are insufficient [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=91.5s)]
*  to remove him from office is cyclical and preposterous in nature. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=98.34s)]
*  And so what I think and hope that the Speaker recognizes is that his 218th vote is less [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=105.66s)]
*  important than the institution of Congress, hallowed or not, as you like to say, Chris. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=112.86s)]
*  But it is true, and we all walk around these halls, we all take our job very seriously, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=119.5s)]
*  and for George Santos to have a vote that counts as much as my vote is a travesty, and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=126.38s)]
*  I think that hopefully the Speaker will come around and recognize that that's the right [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=132.26s)]
*  thing to do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, we should note also that this is not partisan, that other members of the New York [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  class, the freshman class, have come to the same position. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=142.66s)]
*  This is Anthony Desposito, who's a Republican freshman in the, I think, adjacent district [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=147.06s)]
*  to George Santos, who said, as a retired NYPD detective, I'm confident the justice system [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=152.73999999999998s)]
*  will fully reveal his long history of deceit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  I once again call on this serial fraudster to resign from office, freshman Republican [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=159.1s)]
*  member, Mike Lawler, who is in a district that Joe Biden won and is considered one of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=164.5s)]
*  the frontline folks in this next election. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=170.14s)]
*  I reiterate my call for George Santos to step down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=173.34s)]
*  Representative Stefanik in Republican leadership has not done that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  She's also in the New York delegation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  She seems fully gung-ho behind George Santos. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=183.14s)]
*  And she has been the entire time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=186.94s)]
*  She was George Santos' biggest advocate, his biggest endorser. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=189.06s)]
*  She fundraised for him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=193.06s)]
*  And she has not said anything about George Santos' pattern of deceit and lies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=195.17999999999998s)]
*  And she's a part of Republican leadership. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=201.78s)]
*  And what is very clear is that they care much more about power and much more about having [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=203.82s)]
*  their 218 votes than they do about having a fraudster in their party representing nearly [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=209.7s)]
*  800,000 people in Queens and Long Island. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=217.62s)]
*  And it's a total travesty, Chris. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=220.62s)]
*  It really comes down to what people think is wrong with Congress. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=222.1s)]
*  And the problem is that many people will not necessarily relate George Santos to a particular [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=228.9s)]
*  party or to a particular person, Stefanik or McCarthy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=235.38s)]
*  It sullies the reputation of the institution. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=240.1s)]
*  And it really is time that we regain the confidence and trust of the American people by removing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=243.34s)]
*  George Santos. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=249.58s)]
*  Yeah, again, I should note that I think there's multiple members of both parties in the New [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=250.58s)]
*  York delegation have called for him to resign. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=254.26s)]
*  Basically, all the big wigs of the Nassau County Republican politics have called for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  him to resign. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=262.54s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, they did a big press conference. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=263.54s)]
*  That was the one where it was revealed that he had lied about being like a star volleyball [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=266.46s)]
*  player for Baruch College, which is one of my favorite George Soros tall tales. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  But this is like it's sort of a bizarre and almost intolerable situation where it just [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=275.66s)]
*  seems like there's a consensus like this guy lied. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=279.1s)]
*  He shouldn't be there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=281.94s)]
*  Now there's going to be federal charges tomorrow. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=282.98s)]
*  And Kevin McCarthy is like tough, basically. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=284.5s)]
*  Well look at look at the recent history, Chris. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=288.3s)]
*  George Santos was the deciding vote on the debt limit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=294.22s)]
*  George Santos was the deciding vote to make Kevin McCarthy speaker of the House. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=295.22s)]
*  This is very transactional for the speaker to maintain his power and his speakership. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=299.78s)]
*  And so clearly he's going to go down with George Santos as far as he will go. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=311.14s)]
*  Congressman Daniel Goldman also representing New York in this Congress. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=312.14s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=315.73999999999995s)]
*  So during the civil trial that found Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing writer Eugen [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=318.29999999999995s)]
*  Carroll, Carroll's lawyers brought forth 11 witnesses to corroborate her story and as [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=322.41999999999996s)]
*  well as demonstrate a pattern of misconduct by the ex-president. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=327.3s)]
*  One of those witnesses was Natasha Stoynov, a former People magazine writer. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=331.82s)]
*  She testified that Donald Trump sexually assaulted her back in 2005 when she traveled to Mar-a-Lago [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  to write a profile on him. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=340.26s)]
*  Trump denies assaulting anyone. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=342.14s)]
*  Stoynov told the jury she didn't come forward earlier because, quote, I was ashamed and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=344.02s)]
*  humiliated to what had happened. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  I was worried they would kill the story and then Trump would try and get revenge on me [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=350.06s)]
*  and try and destroy me. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=353.86s)]
*  And Natasha Stoynov joins me now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=355.18s)]
*  First of all, I just want to say thank you very much for coming on this evening. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=357.98s)]
*  I really appreciate you coming. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=361.02s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm really glad to be here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  First, just your reaction as someone who had to go to a jury and take an oath and look [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=365.22s)]
*  at those jurors and look at that courtroom and relive what happened to you, your reaction [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=372.06s)]
*  to today's verdict. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=376.4s)]
*  My reaction was elation. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=380.0s)]
*  I was really surprised that it happened so fast and I figured that that was going to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=381.86s)]
*  be good news. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=386.54s)]
*  When I went into the courtroom, it was such a moment of truth. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=390.26s)]
*  I just spoke directly to the jury and I didn't really notice anyone else in the room and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=397.7s)]
*  I just tried to calmly tell them what happened. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=402.78s)]
*  As I spoke to them, it really took me back to those moments, which is why I ended up [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=405.78s)]
*  cheerful several times. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=409.74s)]
*  I just hope that that means that they believed me and trusted me and that helped with this [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=412.18s)]
*  trial. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=416.7s)]
*  Jane Manning, who was my guest in the first block, made a point that I thought was interesting. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=417.7s)]
*  I'd love to hear what you think about it, which is that because it was a federal civil [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=421.62s)]
*  trial, your testimony and the testimony of others was allowed to come in. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=425.34s)]
*  In many jurisdictions, it wouldn't be. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=428.94s)]
*  It would be viewed as excessively prejudicial, but it was allowed and it was allowed by this [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=430.98s)]
*  judge. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=434.78s)]
*  I think it was extremely important. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=438.05999999999995s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to hear from the jury at all who remain anonymous about how [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=441.05999999999995s)]
*  important, but I think the pattern was very crucial for this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=444.05999999999995s)]
*  I also think that perhaps mine and Jessica's testimony, perhaps even mine more so, was [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=447.05999999999995s)]
*  very important. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=452.05999999999995s)]
*  I think that the jury was very important. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=455.05999999999995s)]
*  I think that the jury was very important. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=458.05999999999995s)]
*  I think that the jury was very important. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=461.05999999999995s)]
*  I think that the jury was very important. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=464.34s)]
*  I think that the jury was very important. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=467.34s)]
*  I think that the jury was very important. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=470.34s)]

*  Does it feel like some cosmic balancing of the scales in some way? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=522.9s)]
*  It almost feels like a repeat. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=525.9s)]
*  Because last time I thought for sure he wasn't going to win. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=528.9s)]

*  Because he didn't win by that much now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=559.18s)]

*  And it has to affect some. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=565.18s)]
*  And I want to say one thing about the pattern. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=568.18s)]
*  There were patterns in my story that mimicked e-jeans. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=571.18s)]
*  And that's another reason why I think my testimony is important. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=574.4599999999999s)]

*  Yes, in fact that was really striking. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=580.4599999999999s)]
*  I've read your testimony that you gave before the jury and how much they evoked it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=583.4599999999999s)]

*  about what you've learned from this experience? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=610.74s)]
*  Because I suspect it's been hard to do. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=613.74s)]
*  And certainly hard to do in 2016 and hard to do again in 2023. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=616.74s)]

*  And then when someone is so powerful, i.e. the most powerful man in the world, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=625.74s)]
*  it's like a thousand times harder. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=629.02s)]

*  And I also hope that they feel that maybe they can tell somebody. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=644.02s)]
*  Because even if you can't go to the police, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=647.02s)]

*  given the fact that this was her case, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=668.3s)]
*  and given the fact that this took a tremendous amount of effort [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=671.3s)]

*  I've got to say, I read your testimony, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=710.86s)]
*  partly because reporters that were in the courtroom that day [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=713.86s)]
*  talked about just how profoundly compelling it was indeed. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9pB8En180&t=716.86s)]
