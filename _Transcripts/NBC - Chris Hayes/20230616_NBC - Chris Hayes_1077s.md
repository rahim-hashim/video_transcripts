# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 15
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs)
*  In the week since news first broke of the federal indictment against Donald Trump, right around this time last Thursday, one name has been brought up nearly just as often as a defendant himself. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=0.0s)]
*  And that is of the judge assigned to the case, Judge Aileen Cannon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=8.0s)]
*  Lots of folks have wondered whether Trump appointed federal judge can truly run an impartial trial, particularly after she flagrantly ruled in favor of the ex president during early legal dispute over the classified documents last summer, a ruling that was so out of nowhere that it was quickly reversed by the appellate judges. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=11.0s)]
*  But special counsel Jack Smith may have a backup plan. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=29.0s)]
*  You see, while the Department of Justice charged Trump for illegally retaining the trove of classified documents he stole, he was not charged with disseminating those documents, even though prosecutors say he did just that twice at his New Jersey golf house. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=33.0s)]
*  As lawyers Andrew Weissman and Ryan Goodman note in The Atlantic, Trump still could be charged with dissemination, especially if the special counsel's office believes Judge Cannon is putting her thumb on the scale again. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=46.0s)]
*  Quote, if Aileen Cannon were to seek to pocket veto the charges before her by, say, scheduling the trial for after the 2024 presidential election, the special counsel will be able to sidestep her tactic by proceeding with charges in New Jersey. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=56.0s)]
*  Mary McCord is the former acting assistant attorney general for national security, the Department of Justice. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=69.0s)]
*  She is co-host of the Prosecuting Donald Trump podcast. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=75.0s)]
*  Deborah Perlstein is a professor at Cardozo School of Law. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=78.0s)]
*  She recently wrote an essay for The New York Times on the genius of leaving Trump's fate up to 12 ordinary Floridians. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=81.0s)]
*  Both join me now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=87.0s)]
*  Deborah, let me start with you on that because it sort of gets to this question, right, of a fair shake and venue and doing it in Florida. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=88.0s)]
*  What do you think about the Cannon conundrum such as it is and how to sort of think about it and having this trial in that judge's custody with a jury in Florida? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=96.0s)]
*  So thanks. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=110.0s)]
*  It is a conundrum that the Justice Department is facing, but they've got to thread a remarkably narrow needle here in what they're trying to accomplish with this prosecution. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=112.0s)]
*  They want to obviously see justice done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=121.0s)]
*  We all want to see that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=124.0s)]
*  But they're up against a clock. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=125.0s)]
*  That is, this needs to be wrapped up or close before the 2024 election or at least before the former president is reelected again, which remains a possibility. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=127.0s)]
*  And they have to do this in a way that not only does justice but contributes to the perception that justice is being done in a case that is this incredibly politically fraught. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=139.0s)]
*  The risks, not just for the outcome of the case, but for the system more broadly, are enormously high. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=151.0s)]
*  Going to Florida in the first place eliminates some risks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=158.0s)]
*  They were facing a risk that, for example, venue would be challenged if the case was brought in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=162.0s)]
*  The Justice Department might well have actually prevailed ultimately, but it certainly would have been litigated. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=167.0s)]
*  The former president would have been able to appeal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=173.0s)]
*  That takes time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=175.0s)]
*  Bringing it in Florida short circuits that process. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=176.0s)]
*  And if the Justice Department can prevail there, it has a Florida verdict, a better chance than other options of potentially being taken seriously. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=180.0s)]
*  If it's just a bunch of ordinary Florida citizens, then does a verdict rendered by a jury in what is typically considered a bluer state like New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C.? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, on the sort of New Jersey part of this, Mary, so there's two things here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=203.0s)]
*  First, let's just talk about the charging document and the indictment as read, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=209.0s)]
*  It does have a little bit of a weird Bedminster mystery to it because stuff is clearly going to Bedminster. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=216.0s)]
*  Like he's packing up enough boxes that apparently his wife calls up Walt Natter to be like, please, no, no, don't bring boxes on the plane. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=223.0s)]
*  Right. So the boxes are going to Bedminster. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=230.0s)]
*  We know we have in the indictment two times, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=233.0s)]
*  Showing the map to the guy from the Super PAC and the other, you know, the nuclear secrets or the plan for Iran. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=236.0s)]
*  Right. Both those cases that's happening at Bedminster and yet Bedminster has never searched. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=245.0s)]
*  It's not charged there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=250.0s)]
*  Like, so what do you make of that to begin with? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=252.0s)]
*  Well, I think that the that probably Jack Smith thought it was important to include these allegations in the indictment just to just as a as a part of the storytelling of this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=255.0s)]
*  Right. And to also signify the significance of this, because even though he did not charge dissemination of classified information or national defense information, to be more precise, based on this statute that was used, it helps to tell the story of what all was going on from the time Mr. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=265.0s)]
*  Trump left the White House on January 20th through that search through the execution of the search warrant. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=282.0s)]
*  And that included not only obstructing the investigation by removing boxes, sorting through them and not putting boxes back in the storage room where his attorney came to search for classified information and misleading his attorney about that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=288.0s)]
*  But it also included dissemination. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=304.0s)]
*  But it would have been more challenging to charge those dissemination counts in Florida, because as you just indicated, and as the indictment reflects, they were shown to people in Bedminster. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=306.0s)]
*  Now there's a theory of a continuing offense. If the documents originated in Mar-a-Lago, I mean, they originated in D.C., went to Mar-a-Lago, then went to Bedminster. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=317.0s)]
*  There's a theory there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=326.0s)]
*  But again, just as Deborah said, it could have delayed things because there would have been motions to change venue on those counts in Florida. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=328.0s)]
*  The other thing that could be going on is, you know, it's unclear from this indictment whether the department has all of the evidence it would need to prove up dissemination. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=338.0s)]
*  In other words, does it have that document that he was showing? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=347.0s)]
*  Do we really have it showing either to the two people who were working on Mark Meadow's autobiography or to the Political Action Committee leader? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=350.0s)]
*  And so, you know, there's still some things we don't know, but it is certainly possible that if something goes awry in Florida, it's certainly possible Jack Smith, if he does have that evidence, could bring a case probably relatively quickly in New Jersey. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, I guess the question of like, can you bring that is different than this sort of broader institutional question that Deborah, you're getting at here, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=374.0s)]
*  Which strikes me as like, we're talking about this line, right? You want to zealously prosecute this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=382.0s)]
*  You also want to do it in a way that projects at all times fair play, no dirty pool, no... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=387.0s)]
*  And not necessarily because you're going to insulate yourself from criticism from Donald Trump and his cronies. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=395.0s)]
*  That's going to happen anyway, but it is as a sort of almost testament to the thing you're trying to preserve, Deborah, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=403.0s)]
*  I mean, sort of like theory and practice as one in how you go about doing this. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=410.0s)]
*  It's really true. And the prosecutor here, you know, interestingly, has prosecuted cases in more than one venue. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=415.0s)]
*  He's not only prosecuted cases in the U.S. justice system, he's prosecuted international war crimes cases as well. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=422.0s)]
*  And in both cases and in here in the United States with a case of this kind of political salience, an unprecedented case in U.S. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=428.0s)]
*  history of a former prosecution, it's more like we see in other countries where there's a risk of does this look like politicized prosecution? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=437.0s)]
*  Right. It's a great point. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=447.0s)]
*  Criticisms we hear are not dissimilar from criticisms you hear in other countries when you face things like this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=448.0s)]
*  And he has to be, and I'm sure he is, cognizant of those and working to avoid them to the extent he can. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=455.0s)]
*  That's a very, that's a very astute point. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=463.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, war crimes prosecutions have been called victor's justice since back to Nuremberg, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=465.0s)]
*  When Chief Justice Roderick Jackson was prosecuting them overseas. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=469.0s)]
*  There's some more New York Times reporting on the boxes, Mary, that I think speaks to, you know, just how obsessed the guy appears to be with the contents and how much this is the opposite of what you would normally claim in this case. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=473.0s)]
*  Like if anything happened to my papers, I would be like, I have no idea. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=488.0s)]
*  Like I literally have no, I know where my papers are. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=492.0s)]
*  I don't know what's in any box. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=495.0s)]
*  Like, honestly, I swear to you, this is the opposite here. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=497.0s)]
*  Here's the New York Times. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=499.0s)]
*  Shortly after John Kelly took over Trump's chief of staff, Kelly and other aides grew concerned that some documents were likely presidential actors. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=501.0s)]
*  Records might go missing if they were kept in the residence. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=507.0s)]
*  They impressed upon him the papers had to be tracked, but he was not especially interested. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=509.0s)]
*  Aides started examining the boxes to check for presidential records, but Trump still found ways to bring items to the residence. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=513.0s)]
*  The boxes began to multiply. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=519.0s)]
*  He could point to specific boxes he wanted to take with him on Air Force One when he was traveling and declined to take others, appearing aware of the contents inside the boxes he chose. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=520.0s)]
*  What do you think the significance of that is? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=531.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting because remember, even when he was in office, there was reporting that his aides said how difficult it was to keep him, first of all, taking classified information back to his office. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=534.0s)]
*  But also if he didn't like something, he ripped it up and they would have to tape it together because it was an official record. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=547.0s)]
*  So this is part of his modus operandi, I think. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=553.0s)]
*  And it's interesting because, you know, we've talked before about what was his motive here. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=556.0s)]
*  Why did he retain these classified documents at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=562.0s)]
*  Why did he carry them with him everywhere? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=566.0s)]
*  And, you know, we've speculated about potential, you know, use of monetizing of these or using them as leverage in his own business relationships or potentially with foreign governments or foreign companies. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=568.0s)]
*  But it's also quite possible that it was just purely his weird attachment, his own employee, as alleged in the indictment, called these the beautiful mind boxes that he has this weird attachment to things. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=582.0s)]
*  And, you know, it sounds a little bit like that's a petty and not a significant motive. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=596.0s)]
*  But it could be that there are other motives as well. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=602.0s)]
*  But it definitely seems there's a lot of support for the fact that he really just he felt like these were his. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=605.0s)]
*  He wanted to keep them. He didn't want to give them up. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=610.0s)]
*  He's untrue social within the hour. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=613.0s)]
*  All caps demanding they return the papers to him. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=616.0s)]
*  So still focus on that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=620.0s)]
*  Mary McCord and Deborah Pearlstein. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=622.0s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=624.0s)]
*  In November last year, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis won reelection by nearly 20 points by January of this year. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=628.0s)]
*  His national favorability numbers were looking really good for a state figure. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=634.0s)]
*  According to the polling average, about 45 percent Americans had a favorable view of the governor versus only 35 percent who held an unfavorable view of him. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=639.0s)]
*  But it seems the more voters see of DeSantis, the less they like him. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=647.0s)]
*  His hard right campaign Bazaar Crusade against Disney have alienated independent voters. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=651.0s)]
*  His decision to run against Trump has made him an enemy of the MAGA crowd. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=656.0s)]
*  Since he announced his campaign for the presidency late last month, DeSantis is national favorability ratings have cratered. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=659.0s)]
*  As of today, approximately 48 percent of voters view him unfavorably versus just 36 percent who like him. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=666.0s)]
*  And when it comes to Republican primary voters, things aren't looking much better. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=672.0s)]
*  A new Quinnipiac poll has the governor losing to Trump by 30 points nationally. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=676.0s)]
*  A brand new survey out of New Hampshire has DeSantis down by 32. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=681.0s)]
*  David Jolly is a former Republican congressman from Florida, and he joins me now. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=686.0s)]
*  David, I wanted to talk to you tonight because when we were in Miami, you and you and I spoke and we talked about DeSantis. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=691.0s)]
*  And one of the things you said was, you know, he just he does not he does not wear well. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=699.0s)]
*  Basically, it was what you said. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=704.0s)]
*  And I thought about that commentary when I saw those numbers today. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=706.0s)]
*  What do you make of him? Yeah, one of the few candidates that announces and then his numbers fall. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=710.0s)]
*  You typically don't see that for somebody that's such a strong candidate. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=715.0s)]
*  Look, Ron DeSantis is a uniquely unlikable person. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=718.0s)]
*  And as you get to know him, you discover it's this odd mix of vanity and paranoia and kind of the smartest person in the room complex. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=722.0s)]
*  The problem is the moment then he demonstrates his intelligence, he says things that are antithetical to science and history and law and the Constitution. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=730.0s)]
*  And it leaves people kind of scratching their head. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=738.0s)]
*  I do think, though, if he has one thing going for him, Chris, is his political skill is he knows how to skate to where the puck's going. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=740.0s)]
*  Right. He was he was in front of the Tea Party wave. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=748.0s)]
*  He was an early evangelist for Trumpism. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=750.0s)]
*  And then as Trump lost, he had basically created this culture war movement in today's Republican politics. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=752.0s)]
*  And so if there's one candidate still today that could figure out how to best Donald Trump on the former president's legal vulnerabilities, I do think it's Ron DeSantis. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=759.0s)]
*  I think it could be fairly cagey. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=768.0s)]
*  I'm looking to see some candidate, probably DeSantis, begin to call for a speedy trial and say, Look, I think Donald Trump should be exonerated by a jury. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=770.0s)]
*  Let's have a speedy trial so that this can be put to bed before the primary and let the president be vindicated. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=780.0s)]
*  You don't have to say he's guilty. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=786.0s)]
*  You could actually say you think he would be acquitted. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=787.0s)]
*  I think that's that conversation has yet to emerge in Republican politics. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=790.0s)]
*  DeSantis is the type of person that could actually lead that conversation. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=794.0s)]
*  That's all that's all interesting and well said. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=798.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that's notable here, and I should I always say this right, like when we were doing polling in 2015 of June, it was like Jeb Bush over Scott Walker. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=801.0s)]
*  Like all this so early and and like, who knows? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=808.0s)]
*  Maybe, you know, maybe we have COVID-20, 23 in the fall and everything goes apart. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=812.0s)]
*  So we don't know what the future brings. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=817.0s)]
*  But the point, though, is that the favorability issue to me just speaks to like what he is trying to do right now, which it doesn't seem it's it's not clear to me what he is trying to do. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=819.0s)]
*  Right. Like he it's like you're not gaining with anyone right now. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=833.0s)]
*  You're only losing people. So you alienated Trump people. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=837.0s)]
*  But that's sort of it. It's like I don't I don't quite understand the strategy here. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=839.0s)]
*  Yeah, Chris. So a reminder of Ron DeSantis and I ran against each other for over a year for the U.S. Senate in 2016. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=843.0s)]
*  In fact, I led him for over a year and then Marco Rubio got back into the Senate race and pushed us both out. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=850.0s)]
*  So I know his candidacy pretty well, his political character pretty well. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=855.0s)]
*  He is an angry person. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=860.0s)]
*  And that begins to come out just today in Florida. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=863.0s)]
*  He vetoed the Senate projects of a state senator who had endorsed Donald Trump. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=866.0s)]
*  Now, look, we all understand the give and take. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=871.0s)]
*  And if you're not with me, maybe I'll veto your projects. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=873.0s)]
*  But this is Republican on Republican crime, if you will. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=876.0s)]
*  And Ron DeSantis needs friends, not enemies. He's losing the primary. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=879.0s)]
*  He's not winning it. So this was a losing candidate flexing his strength, making one more enemy in Republican politics. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=882.0s)]
*  And it speaks to his overall kind of angry character that he's created for himself in the GOP primary. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=889.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about this loyalty pledge situation. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=895.0s)]
*  So you've got you know, there's this loyalty pledge. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=899.0s)]
*  You got a pledge that you'll support the eventual nominee. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=901.0s)]
*  This was born back in 2015, 2016 when they thought Trump would bolt. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=903.0s)]
*  They all signed it. This is what Asa Hutchinson is saying in light of Donald Trump's indictment for his handling of classified documents. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=907.0s)]
*  Former Arkansas owner Asa Hutchinson's campaign on Wednesday requested a meeting with R&C officials about amending the loyalty pledge. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=914.0s)]
*  During the brief call, R&C leaders declined to make any changes to debate requirements until the Stafford committee is not dealing with hypotheticals on Trump's legal fate. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=921.0s)]
*  One of the individuals with knowledge of the call described it as contentious. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=928.0s)]
*  Apparently, Asa Hutchinson wanted to add a clause that you did not have to support the nominee if they were convicted of a felony. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=931.0s)]
*  And R&C was having none of that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=939.0s)]
*  But again, like any time you actually say it out loud, it reminds you of what a ludicrous situation the Republican Party is walking into right now. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=941.0s)]
*  A remarkable moment for the National Republican Party. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=950.0s)]
*  I'm a little surprised, Chris, and I realize this requires an alliance of competitors. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=954.0s)]
*  But this is an issue where all of the presidential candidates could actually agree with Asa Hutchinson. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=959.0s)]
*  And this is where you could say, we actually think Donald Trump could be exonerated on the law. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=964.0s)]
*  Let's have a trial. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=968.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, if he's convicted, it is not the right candidate for our party. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=969.0s)]
*  Don't ask me to support him. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=973.0s)]
*  Yes, I think that's not crazy. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=975.0s)]
*  I mean, look, what I'm looking for is that effect that it happens slowly and then all at once. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=976.0s)]
*  At the first August primary debate, at the first debate in August, do we see all the candidates actually have some type of similar statement, joint statement? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=981.0s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=989.0s)]
*  And that's a condemnation for the candidate. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=990.0s)]
*  Finally, there's just to me the continuing fact that Donald Trump is not popular with voters. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=995.0s)]
*  He's not getting more popular with voters the more he gets indicted. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1003.0s)]
*  And when you look at these focus groups of Biden voters who disapprove of Joe Biden, the low hanging fruit, the persuadable folks you want to aim at if you're a Republican Party, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1006.0s)]
*  they can say whatever they want about Joe Biden. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1017.0s)]
*  In the end, you say, what about Trump? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1018.0s)]
*  They're like, absolutely not. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1019.0s)]
*  And that to me is just the ground political fact that I just don't understand why more people in the Republican Party don't see. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1020.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, we're talking about Republican leaders in Washington and Republican voters. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1025.0s)]
*  Donald Trump created a cultural movement and decided to park it in today's Republican Party. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1030.0s)]
*  I think the biggest gamble of all is Donald Trump is hoping to land the actual trial after the early primary. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1035.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1041.0s)]
*  Bates in February and March. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1042.0s)]
*  The biggest gamble for the country is exactly the same because if Donald Trump wins the GOP primary, the nation is likely saved another term of Donald Trump or Republican like Donald Trump because Joe Biden beats him. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdIWcMLwTs&t=1044.0s)]
