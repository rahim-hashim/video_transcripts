Video Description: “The world that they want to shape—to go back to before Me Too—is one where consent really doesn’t mean much. And we go back to an ethos that says it’s fine for powerful men to do whatever they want,” says Chris Hayes on the many Trump cabinet picks accused of sexual misconduct. The Cut’s Laura Basset joins to discuss.

# ‘Enraging’ Trump spawns ‘revenge for Me Too’ with Cabinet picks
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY)
*  Now that Donald Trump's first cabinet nominee has flopped, all eyes are on his next most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=0.0s)]
*  vulnerable candidate, the one we were just discussing, Fox News Weekend host Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=4.28s)]
*  who is up to run the United States military. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=8.24s)]
*  Like former Congressman Matt Gaetz, Hegseth faces a serious accusation of sexual misconduct. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=11.68s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, Senate Republicans remain open to confirming him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=16.76s)]
*  Senators stressed, the Post, that police had investigated a 2017 allegation that Hegseth [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=20.56s)]
*  had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman at the California political conference and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=25.16s)]
*  declined to press charges. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=29.04s)]
*  Hegseth denies the allegation against him and says the sex was consensual with the woman [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=31.24s)]
*  in question. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=35.56s)]
*  However, he did pay the woman, quote, an undisclosed sum as part of a nondisclosure agreement for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=36.56s)]
*  her silence on the matter because he feared his career at Fox News would suffer. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=40.84s)]
*  Obviously there's little history and context over at Fox News with this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=44.96s)]
*  And of course, Gaetz and Hegseth are just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  As Peter Baker puts it in the New York Times, Donald Trump is defying the MeToo movement [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=51.28s)]
*  with his cabinet picks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  And it's worth taking a step back to remember like how we got here, how all this began, right? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=57.08s)]
*  From the moment that he descended the Golden Escalator at Trump Tower to announce his bid [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=62.6s)]
*  for office, Donald Trump set off a series of earthquakes and reactions in American society. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=65.8s)]
*  And one of the biggest, the most seismic disruptions he helped to usher in was a new era of rage [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=70.64s)]
*  and accountability around sexual abuse. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=77.2s)]
*  It tracks back to the month before the 2016 election when we all heard the then Republican [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  nominee bragging about sexual assault on the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=86.0s)]
*  And then shortly thereafter, the avalanche of women is stepping forward to say, oh, yeah, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=90.84s)]
*  he did exactly the same thing to them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=94.28s)]
*  And of course, Trump responded by calling them liars, claiming they were too fat and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=97.04s)]
*  ugly for him to want to assault. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  And despite all that, he then beat the first woman presidential nominee of major party. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  And millions expressed their fury taking the streets in women's marches across the country [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=107.76s)]
*  the day after the inauguration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=112.48s)]
*  And within months, we were in the throes of the Me Too movement as women stood up and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=114.96s)]
*  spoke out about sexual abuse in all different parts of society. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=120.0s)]
*  It was, I mean, we were all there, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=123.08s)]
*  You remember, it was enormous change. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=124.96s)]
*  The fact is that sexual harassment and sexual abuse, sexual assault were essentially open [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=129.32s)]
*  secrets just known and tolerated across every institution in American life for a very long [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=132.76s)]
*  time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=138.56s)]
*  We live with a culture and sometimes even explicit conspiracy of silence that basically [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=139.56s)]
*  brush it off and look the other way. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=143.74s)]
*  And then this moment came, this seismic moment when women, not just women, men too, said [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=146.28s)]
*  enough. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  So now seven years later, Donald Trump is about to return to office. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=153.02s)]
*  He's going to sweep back into the White House with a movement set on erasing that progress. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=156.44s)]
*  Trump and his allies want to create a society ordered around the opposite of Me Too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  They appear to be seeking out people accused of sexual abuse to elevate them to key positions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=168.62s)]
*  of power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=173.72s)]
*  I mean, they could pick, there's lots of people out there, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=174.72s)]
*  Look who he has chosen for top jobs in addition to Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=178.98s)]
*  There's of course, Elon Musk, the co-president, the subject of a sexual harassment lawsuit [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=182.02s)]
*  from eight former SpaceX employees who say he made sexually inappropriate comments and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=185.76s)]
*  created a hostile work environment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=190.22s)]
*  Musk denies any wrongdoing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=191.9s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was accused of sexually assaulting his 23 year old babysitter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=193.9s)]
*  Let's just think about that for a second. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=198.94s)]
*  Your babysitter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=200.5s)]
*  And he has not exactly denied that allegation, but said that he is quote, not a church boy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=202.9s)]
*  And of course, at the top of it all, the top of the pyramid is the man accused of sexual [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=208.16s)]
*  misconduct by more than two dozen women, which he denies, but also found liable by a jury [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=212.12s)]
*  of his peers after a trial for sexually abusing and subsequently defaming a woman who says [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=217.6s)]
*  he raped her in a department store wrestling room. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=222.4s)]
*  Trump claims that is a quote, made up fabricated story. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=225.82s)]
*  It seems like the goal of the new Trump administration is to put as many men as possible in positions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=230.0s)]
*  of power who have been accused and investigated, even admitted to sexual misconduct. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=234.62s)]
*  In other words, the opposite of Me Too. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=239.48s)]
*  A culture in which men victimizing and abusing and preying on, assaulting, harassing, and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=243.58s)]
*  raping women, and sometimes men, children, is just not seen as that big of a deal. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=247.7s)]
*  Like, eh. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=253.26s)]
*  Certainly not seen as disqualifying for higher office. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=255.14s)]
*  Because the world they want to shape, really, to go back to before Me Too, is one where [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=258.66s)]
*  consent really doesn't mean much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  That we just go back to an ethos that says it's fine for powerful men to do whatever [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  they want. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  Who can really say? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  This is really like a truly principled belief of theirs. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  It is not an accident. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=277.24s)]
*  It's the core of the agenda. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=279.0s)]
*  But if this is all part of a backlash to both feminism in general and Me Too in particular, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=282.56s)]
*  then know this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=286.96s)]
*  There will be a backlash to the backlash. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't know what's coming, but spending tons of political capital telling the millions [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  of survivors of sexual assault and harassment to shut the hell up and take it is not going [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=298.02s)]
*  to work. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=302.94s)]
*  I promise you they will not shut up and they will not take it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=303.94s)]
*  Laura Bassett writes a newsletter on Substack called Nightcap. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=308.97999999999996s)]
*  She's also a contributor for New York Magazine's The Cut, where she writes Trump's cabinet [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  I really liked your column. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  Obviously I was thinking along similar lines. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  How do you see, I mean at some level like, well they just have a lot of accused predators [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=327.48s)]
*  in their circle, so it's not an ideological project, but it does, I don't know, it does [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=333.16s)]
*  feel like they're saying something here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=337.18s)]
*  It does. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  I think Trump deliberately is surrounding himself with other men who have been accused. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, Trump's a vengeful guy, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=343.88s)]
*  If you recall, when he first got elected he said the first thing I'm going to do as president [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=345.66s)]
*  back in 2016 is to sue all the women who accused me of sexual assault. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  So we know that he wants his piece of flesh or whatever, he wants his pound of flesh, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=354.8s)]
*  and he never ended up suing those women and then things got worse for him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=360.1s)]
*  Stormy Daniels basically took him down in court. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=363.68s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll won two defamation trials against him, not just once, but twice, and now he's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  been re-elected. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=373.18s)]
*  And so this time he's surrounding himself with other men who have been accused so that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=374.18s)]
*  he can send a message that, you know what we're not afraid of is rape, what we are afraid [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=377.76s)]
*  of is men losing their careers to these accusations. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=382.14s)]
*  It's been very interesting to me to watch the sort of the Hegseth stuff, and again I [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=385.86s)]
*  want to be clear, he denies this, he says there was a consensual sexual counter in which [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=390.7s)]
*  a woman who had gone to the hotel with her husband and children at a conservative women's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  conference consensually slept with him and then fabricated an allegation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=398.76s)]
*  But what I think is interesting here is the defense is, well, the police looked into it, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  which they did, there's a police report, and chose not to bring charges. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=408.84s)]
*  And I feel like one of the defining things we learned in Me Too was that just because [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=412.56s)]
*  the police don't arrest someone for a sexual assault does not therefore mean a sexual assault [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=417.84s)]
*  did not happen. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=422.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=423.08s)]
*  I mean, then the entire point of the Me Too movement is that powerful men have gotten [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=424.08s)]
*  away with being serial rapists for years. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=427.68s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the Hegseth report, at the actual police report, which I recommend [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=430.68s)]
*  that everyone does, the details are nauseating. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=434.56s)]
*  I mean, she says he took her phone away, that she said no multiple times, that he blocked [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=437.44s)]
*  her from getting out of the hotel room. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=441.0s)]
*  She went to the ER and did a rape kit. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=442.6s)]
*  She reported it to the police. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=444.4s)]
*  This woman did everything right. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=445.52s)]
*  And the fact that the police didn't pursue it, I mean, since when are the police so great [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  at dealing with rape in the first place? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's amazing to me that, you know, are we even trying anymore? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=453.52s)]
*  Well, that is the thing, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  Because I think what happened with my read on this, and I'm curious what you think, is [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=460.64s)]
*  that we had this moment of real sort of like fervor and a long overdue reckoning. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  Then there was like you started to feel this sort of like backlash brewing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=469.64s)]
*  And I don't want to minimize, like there were, there are tough calls in areas of real nuance [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=473.0s)]
*  about accountability, redemption, also like how you do actually get to the bottom of difficult [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=477.08s)]
*  factual contested questions that aren't a trial. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=484.28s)]
*  Like there are real actual nuanced things. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  Then that became like the full backlash, which is just like what we're seeing here. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=489.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=495.96s)]
*  I think part of the problem was that the mantra sort of believe women, which is sort of trying [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=496.96s)]
*  to correct from women never being believed, was turned into believe all women, which conservatives [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=501.94s)]
*  took to mean that a woman can just open her mouth and say anything and we automatically [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=507.94s)]
*  believe her. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=511.58s)]
*  And that was never what the Me Too movement was seeking. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=512.58s)]
*  And that's never what progressives were saying. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=514.66s)]
*  But I think that sort of, I felt the sea change start with Christine Blasey Ford, and she [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=517.1s)]
*  gave that incredibly powerful testimony. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=523.14s)]
*  And half the country just said, we don't believe you or we don't care. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=525.6s)]
*  And now we have little boys chanting at girls in classrooms, your body, my choice. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=531.18s)]
*  I mean, you can Google it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=538.5s)]
*  This is no, I know. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=539.5s)]
*  I mean, I think the reason that my eyes got wide there is that I just feel like I feel [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=540.5s)]
*  like I'm watching them shoving gunpowder into the crevices of something, which is like this [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=545.2199999999999s)]
*  idea that you're sort of leaning into this kind of like chauvinist vision of male domination, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=555.36s)]
*  which I think is a very poor and sort of sad and cramped and actually kind of pathetic [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=562.96s)]
*  vision of masculinity personally. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=569.6s)]
*  But the idea that you're just going to do that and there's not going to be a response [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=573.12s)]
*  to it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=578.28s)]
*  Like, I just feel like if you didn't like the first Me Too fervor, I don't think you're [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=579.28s)]
*  doing a great job right now of avoiding something like that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=584.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=589.0400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=590.0400000000001s)]
*  The next one's going to be bigger. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the first time I remember the sort of power and now we, you know, it hasn't [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=592.0400000000001s)]
*  aged that well. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=595.64s)]
*  We look back on the women's march and the pink knitted pussy hats and everyone kind [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=596.64s)]
*  of thinks that that was silly. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=600.12s)]
*  But I remember at the time feeling the power of the collective, I mean, women's rage. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=601.52s)]
*  They were marching and they were angry and they were getting tattoos and the, you know, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  and it worked. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  They put some really powerful men in jail who wouldn't otherwise have ever been held [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=611.4000000000001s)]
*  accountable. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=614.56s)]
*  And, you know, the pendulum swings and the pendulum has swung this way where the apex [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=615.56s)]
*  of the backlash and when it swings the other way, it's going to be so much worse for these [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  men and for the women who enable them. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you think it matters? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=627.64s)]
*  Again, this is like it's inside our baseball because about who's going to be the attorney [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=629.3599999999999s)]
*  general. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=633.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=634.04s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=635.04s)]
*  I just felt the Gates thing mattered. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=636.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  It just is like it's just too much. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  You think it was a good sign that he had to pull out? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=644.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's for complicated reasons. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=647.32s)]
*  He's loathe by fellow Republicans, whatever. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  But I think like, yeah, I think it was important that he didn't. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm certainly glad he didn't go through. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=656.12s)]
*  I think that he has sort of been a lightning rod for all the attention. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=658.4s)]
*  And so it's helping these other men get through. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=665.1600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  Even Linda McMahon. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=667.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's like half the cabinet at this point. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=670.2s)]
*  Linda McMahon, just to people don't know, she's been accused in a recent lawsuit of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=671.6400000000001s)]
*  failing to stop a ringside announcer for World Wrestling and Entertainment from grooming [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=675.12s)]
*  and sexually abusing children in the 80s and 90s. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=679.5200000000001s)]
*  This is a long pattern alleged in this lawsuit. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=682.44s)]
*  They say they did not know about it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=684.84s)]
*  Laura Bassett. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=687.12s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ1Y2EECwY&t=688.12s)]
