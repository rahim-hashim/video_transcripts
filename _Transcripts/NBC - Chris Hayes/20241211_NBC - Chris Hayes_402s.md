# ‘The bureau is in trouble’ J. Edgar Hoover biographer reacts to FBI director resigning
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY)
*  The abrupt resignation of FBI Director Chris Wray was a result of an immense pressure campaign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=0.0s)]
*  by Donald Trump and his allies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=5.92s)]
*  And that push to force Wray out is part of a larger effort to undo half a century of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=7.7s)]
*  institutional reforms to the FBI passed in the wake of Watergate and the decades-long [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=13.64s)]
*  reign of J. Edgar Hoover. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=18.88s)]
*  Donald Trump wants his choice for FBI Director Cash Patel to wield the authority of the Bureau [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  against his perceived enemies, much in the way that Hoover did during his tenure. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=26.64s)]
*  But as my next guest writes, Patel views the FBI very differently from Hoover, and he is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=31.8s)]
*  promising a crusade not just against Trump's critics, but against the Bureau itself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=36.24s)]
*  Hoover used to describe the Bureau as the one bulwark against a hidden left-wing conspiracy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=41.92s)]
*  that penetrated all corners of American life. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  In Patel's world, the FBI is the conspiracy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Beverly Gage is a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and author of G-Man, J. Edgar Hoover and the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=54.32s)]
*  Making of the American Century. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  She also has a new piece from The New Yorker Today asking, how would Cash Patel compare [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=61.52s)]
*  to J. Edgar Hoover? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=65.8s)]
*  Professor, it's great to have you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=66.8s)]
*  I am really enjoying your book, which is just a masterful, masterful piece of work, so thank [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  you for writing it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=73.88s)]
*  As someone who wrote a biography of J. Edgar Hoover and who's watching all this unfold, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=75.92s)]
*  what's your reaction to Ray's announcement today and what it means for the Bureau? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=81.12s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry the book is so relevant at the moment, but I think Ray's resignation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  is a real sign that the Bureau is in trouble. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=92.48s)]
*  Hoover had lots of faults, but he believed in the Bureau and he actually mostly tried [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=96.12s)]
*  to insulate it from political pressure that he didn't like. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=101.04s)]
*  And here we're just seeing kind of naked announcements that the Bureau is going to be used as a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  political weapon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=111.08s)]
*  Yeah, you write this, Hoover, for all his faults and abuses of power, was nevertheless [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=112.08s)]
*  an institution builder. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=115.96s)]
*  He believed in the FBI's nonpartisan independence. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=117.24s)]
*  Patel's chief goal, by contrast, is to weaponize the FBI as a partisan force to protect Trump [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=120.8s)]
*  and wreak vengeance on his administration's enemies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=124.98s)]
*  If such naked politicization happens to undermine public faith in the FBI, so much the better. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=128.36s)]
*  The big difference here is Hoover sort of ran the FBI as a kind of fiefdom where his [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=133.76s)]
*  own ideological axes to grind, petty grievances, wherever, it was a vector for that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=137.92s)]
*  It was not a vector for the president in power. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=144.0s)]
*  In fact, sometimes it was deployed against them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=147.04s)]
*  How different would it be to have an FBI basically acting in a Hooverite fashion but on behalf [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  of the guy in the White House? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Hoover served under four Democrats and four Republicans. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=160.44s)]
*  So he was, for all of his faults, a sort of legitimately nonpartisan figure. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=163.7s)]
*  And of course, the critique when he died, he was there for 48 years, was that the Bureau [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  had become too independent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=174.66s)]
*  It was too insulated. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  In fact, the FBI director was more powerful than the president. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  So I don't think we want to go back to the era of J. Edgar Hoover, but in the circumstance [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=182.14s)]
*  we're in now, I think you can see some of the virtues in that kind of independence and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=187.66s)]
*  the ability to be insulated from this kind of really direct, bald political pressure. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=193.5s)]
*  You make this really important point that I think it's worth us lingering on for a moment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=199.72s)]
*  Obviously, there are constitutional checks on abuses of power through those rights secured [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=205.86s)]
*  in the Constitution and judges and approving warrants and things like that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=212.7s)]
*  Now, those can sometimes be flimsy in the real world, but they exist. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=217.1s)]
*  You make the point that the worst abuses, you say the worst abuses of FBI power have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=220.62s)]
*  usually come through its intelligence and surveillance operations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=224.54s)]
*  Making a criminal case in court is hard. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=229.06s)]
*  There are laws and procedures and evidentiary standards. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=231.3s)]
*  Intelligence investigations operate in a more nebulous realm. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=235.06s)]
*  Tell me more about your thoughts on that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=239.02s)]
*  Yeah, the FBI is this funny kind of hybrid organization where, on the one hand, they're [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=241.9s)]
*  a law enforcement agency, but we've also made them into our domestic intelligence agency. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=248.46s)]
*  Certainly during Hoover's day, it was the intelligence side where almost all of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=254.78s)]
*  abuses occurred, in part because intelligence doesn't have quite the same kind of evidentiary [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=259.74s)]
*  standards. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=267.26s)]
*  Often you're not trying to make a case in court. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=268.26s)]
*  You're just trying to kind of get dirt on people, figure out what's going on, and at [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=270.42s)]
*  various points, the FBI can use wiretaps and bugs and even infiltration of political organizations [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  if they deem that they are somehow dangerous enough. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=282.06s)]
*  It's a very powerful set of tools. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  There are some restrictions on it, but this is a big secretive bureaucracy, and in the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=287.94s)]
*  hands of the wrong people, even that power of investigation and surveillance and information [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=293.22s)]
*  gathering can be really powerful and dangerous. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  What would you ask a senator who came to you, having read your book, and was preparing, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=304.58s)]
*  say, for a hearing of the nominee, Cash Patel, trying to think through what are questions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  or concerns they should be airing and focusing on? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=316.26s)]
*  Well, I think one of the things that he could think about is really just whether Cash Patel [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=319.94s)]
*  knows how to run a bureaucracy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=328.9s)]
*  I think one of the things that is alarming about Patel is not only this idea that he's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=331.18s)]
*  going to weaponize the Bureau, but that he kind of wants to come in with a wrecking ball [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=335.5s)]
*  and in some ways destroy certainly the upper echelons of the institution itself. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=340.62s)]
*  He professes to be a great ally of the rank and file, but he wants to destroy, shut down, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=346.7s)]
*  get rid of the D.C. headquarters. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=353.38s)]
*  That's just a very strange thing to think about, a massive law enforcement and intelligence [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=355.94s)]
*  bureaucracy operating without a headquarters. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=361.78s)]
*  So there are lots of political questions to ask. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=364.46s)]
*  There are lots of questions about respect for law, but there's also a question of does [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=367.14s)]
*  he actually want the FBI to be a functioning organization or not? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=372.78s)]
*  Beverly Gage, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XqCcQqv-nY&t=378.22s)]
