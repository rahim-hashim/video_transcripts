# ‘He’s broke’ AOC roasts Trump for hosting a campaign rally in the Bronx
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y)
*  RONNIE MANOWS, Someone who does actually represent parts of the Bronx, Democratic Congresswoman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=5.4s)]
*  It's good to see you, Congresswoman. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=7.44s)]
*  I should note the rally is technically in Richie Torres' district. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=9.52s)]
*  Just to be clear on the district lines, what do you think about a big Donald Trump rally [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=12.34s)]
*  in the Bronx? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=17.16s)]
*  I mean, I think, as you mentioned earlier, this guy is stuck in court. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=18.16s)]
*  And let's be very clear about the fact that he is stuck in court over hush-money payments [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=26.4s)]
*  in order to quiet the story about him having sex with Stormy Daniels in the lead-up to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=34.12s)]
*  the election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And I think that, because he is stuck on so many charges around fraud and these payments, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=42.8s)]
*  he is stuck in a pretty tight radius of where he can go. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=51.4s)]
*  New York City is blue. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=55.64s)]
*  Brooklyn is blue. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=57.0s)]
*  Queens is blue. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  The Bronx is blue. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=61.36s)]
*  And he's got nowhere to go. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  And so he's decided to come to the South Bronx. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=64.12s)]
*  He's broke. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=66.2s)]
*  He needs to pay these legal funds. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=67.2s)]
*  And busing people in in order to get those donations so that he can funnel them to his [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=69.52s)]
*  legal fees is kind of his business right now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=75.04s)]
*  I will say, Crotona Park is quite nice. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=77.92s)]
*  I think it once had a reputation for being pretty ragged, but it's quite nice. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=80.6s)]
*  And I'm hoping that the many people coming down from Westchester get a moment to appreciate [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  the beauty and splendor of our borough of the Bronx, which is indeed a beautiful place. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that the Green New Deal investments that we have secured through community [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=92.68s)]
*  project funds have absolutely beautified everywhere from Pelham Bay Park, Crotona Park, and Throgsmec [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Smoking like an incumbent running for reelection. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Congresswoman. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=108.28s)]
*  We just had this news about Samuelito. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=109.68s)]
*  And I think all of us are sort of there's a little bit of sort of banging your head [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=113.48s)]
*  against the wall, like, OK, what now? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  And a feeling like the affirmative decision to fly these flags feels like some form of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=119.16s)]
*  taunting. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=123.08s)]
*  I mean, he could just not do it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=124.08s)]
*  You could just sit in your house and write daubes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=125.44s)]
*  You don't have to fly any flags. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=127.04s)]
*  You got a lot of power. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=128.96s)]
*  What do you see as your role as a Democratic member of Congress in a Democratic House majority [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=130.8s)]
*  with respect to this court, specifically Alito and more broadly? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=136.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't even think that we have to wait until we have a Democratic House [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=141.44s)]
*  majority because we have a Democratic Senate majority. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  And this is a—you know, this is an alarm that I've been sounding for quite some time [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=150.68s)]
*  now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=155.0s)]
*  I think that what we are seeing here is an extraordinary breach of not just the trust [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=156.0s)]
*  and the stature of the Supreme Court, but we are seeing a fundamental challenge to our [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=163.4s)]
*  democracy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=169.4s)]
*  Samuel Alito has identified himself with the same people who raided the Capitol on January [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=170.84s)]
*  6th and is now going to be presiding over court cases that have deep implications over [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=178.36s)]
*  the participants of that rally. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=185.8s)]
*  And while this is the threat to our democracy, Democrats have a responsibility for defending [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=188.72s)]
*  our democracy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=195.86s)]
*  And in the Senate, we have gavels. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=197.62s)]
*  There should be subpoenas going out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=200.96s)]
*  There should be active investigations that are happening. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=201.96s)]
*  And I believe that when House Democrats take the majority, we are preparing and ensuring [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=205.02s)]
*  to support the broader effort to stand up our democracy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  But I also believe that when Democrats have power, we have to use it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  We cannot be in perpetual campaign mode. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  We need to be in governance mode. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=226.18s)]
*  We need to be in accountability mode with every lever that we have, because we cannot [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=228.06s)]
*  take a Senate majority for granted, a House majority for granted, or a White House for [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  granted. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=237.5s)]
*  Every single minute matters, and we have to use our power when we have it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGiP0S3gO4Y&t=238.5s)]
