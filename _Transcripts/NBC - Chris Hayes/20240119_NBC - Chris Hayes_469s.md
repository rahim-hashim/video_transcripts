# Trump begs Supreme Court to rule in his favor in ‘closing message’ to New Hampshire voters
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are four days from the New Hampshire primary and what is shaping up to be a make or break moment for both the Republican Party in the nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=0.0s)]
*  A bit over a year ago, take yourself back right after the 2022 midterms, there was this dawning awareness among both the professional Republican political class and Republican Party primary voters that Donald Trump was pretty politically toxic. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=9.0s)]
*  And a bunch of credible Republican candidates announced presidential campaigns and it really looked like it could be a competitive primary. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=23.0s)]
*  It doesn't look so competitive anymore. The ex president just beat all of his opponents combined in the Iowa caucus. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=31.0s)]
*  He's pulling double digits ahead of his closest competitor Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=38.0s)]
*  If Trump does end up winning decisively in the Granite State, it is difficult to see how there could be even the semblance of a competitive race going forward. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=43.0s)]
*  Of course, as we always say here, the future remains unwritten. Nikki Haley has held some momentum in the last few weeks, remains possible. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=52.0s)]
*  She pulls out a surprise victory. New Hampshire has surprised us before. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=60.0s)]
*  If she doesn't, though, Donald Trump will likely be the Republican nominee. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=64.0s)]
*  Fourteen months after Trump led Republicans to that catastrophic midterm election, he's once again consolidated the base and the Republican Party behind him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=68.0s)]
*  Now, perhaps the most obvious factor that led us to this point is that Trump has successfully convinced Republican primary voters that all the various lawsuits and prosecutions he faces are political witch hunts. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=77.0s)]
*  But that part's easy. Those those people are primed to believe that anyway, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=88.0s)]
*  That's the low hanging fruit. The bigger factor is that nine years into his political career, the ex president has never actually faced real consequences for anything. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=93.0s)]
*  Even as he is currently awaiting judgment in his civil fraud trial, the so-called death corporate death sentence for the Trump work, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=103.0s)]
*  The New York attorney general is demanding three hundred and seventy million dollars in fines and a lifetime ban on the ex president participating in the state's real estate industry. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=111.0s)]
*  Today, we just got new video of a deposition recorded last year as part of that case where he railed against prosecutors and banks, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=120.0s)]
*  seemed to openly regret the meager extent to which he nominally separated himself from his businesses while in office. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=127.0s)]
*  I thought it would be appropriate to put it in a trust. I didn't want there to be a conflict, although there could have been. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=134.0s)]
*  I tell the story that George Washington actually, when he was president, had two desks, one for his business. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=144.0s)]
*  He was actually a very wealthy man, one for his business and one for running the country. I could have had that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=150.0s)]
*  We should note, of course, that he didn't really divide them up much. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, he grifted millions of dollars towards his private businesses while in the White House. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=159.0s)]
*  He set up his hotel as a kind of bribery palace down the block. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=163.0s)]
*  And to be clear, that civil fraud trial with the corporate death penalty looming over him is not the only civil trial he is facing in New York. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=167.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, he attended his second defamation trial for writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=175.0s)]
*  Carroll says Trump sexually assaulted her in a dressing room back in the 1990s. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=181.0s)]
*  And during a lengthy trial with evidence presented, a jury determined that she was telling the truth and found Trump liable for sexual abuse. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=186.0s)]
*  And after his day in court this week, Trump went outside and effectively turned it into a campaign event complete with American flags. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=195.0s)]
*  Now, this goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=202.0s)]
*  These are circumstances that no other political candidate could possibly survive. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=206.0s)]
*  Like, just imagine just some other Republican or Democratic possible nominee, like emerging from the sex abuse defamation trial. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=210.0s)]
*  And because of that, I want to be clear here, it is not totally irrational for there to be this pervasive sense among the electorate, Republicans and others, that he's going to wriggle out of this jam too. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=220.0s)]
*  But there's one consistent data point that shows things might really be different this time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=231.0s)]
*  Poll after poll after poll shows that voters might actually abandon Trump if he gets convicted of a crime. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=236.0s)]
*  An example Reuters Ipsos poll earlier this month found that nearly two thirds of all voters, including a majority of independents and nearly a third of Republicans, would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a felony. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=245.0s)]
*  A New York Times-Ciena poll from last month found the same percentage of Republicans, 28%, that say Trump should not be their party's nominee if he gets convicted, even if he wins the most votes in the primary. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=258.0s)]
*  NBC News entrance polling from the Iowa caucus earlier this week, a sample of the most engaged Republican primary voters, found that about a third of them, right, consistent numbers here, a third of them also say a conviction would make Trump unfit for office. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=270.0s)]
*  Now to be clear, I'm not naive. This is a future hypothetical post to these folks. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=285.0s)]
*  And a bunch of those people are going to talk themselves into voting for him anyway, trust me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=290.0s)]
*  But some of them won't. And elections are determined in the margins. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=294.0s)]
*  Donald Trump understands that full well. I mean, his one goal is now winning the presidency to stay out of prison. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=299.0s)]
*  I mean, clearly. And he knows a conviction makes that much, much harder. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=306.0s)]
*  So now he is monomaniacally focused on this issue of presidential immunity, not just at the practical level, but as the express justification for his entire campaign. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=311.0s)]
*  He made it explicit last night after Sean Hannity, in typical fashion, teed him up a softball question on his closing message for voters in New Hampshire. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=320.0s)]
*  What is your closing message to the people of New Hampshire? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=329.0s)]
*  It's very simple. It's make America great again. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=333.0s)]
*  But I think very important before we do this, because you were talking about the Supreme Court, they have two votes that are very important coming up. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=336.0s)]
*  One is, as we discussed, we call it Colorado or whatever. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=342.0s)]
*  But, you know, I really believe they're going to leave the people to vote. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=345.0s)]
*  Again, you're the leading candidate in both parties. You're leading the Democrats by many, many points. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=349.0s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to imagine they would do. And most states have already approved it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=354.0s)]
*  As you know, very few states have done that. This is Colorado and a couple of others at this moment. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=360.0s)]
*  But they have another important and that's immunity for the president. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=365.0s)]
*  The president of the United States, and I'm not talking about myself, I'm talking about any president, has to have immunity. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=368.0s)]
*  Because if you take immunity away from the president, so important, you will have you have a president that's not going to be able to do anything. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=373.0s)]
*  Because when he leaves office, the opposing party president, if it's the opposing party, will indict the president for doing something that should have been good. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=380.0s)]
*  Just to be clear, right, if this is like the closing case, he's like, what do you want to tell the voters in New Hampshire about their lives and their futures and why they should vote for you if they're grinding away and Biden's economy? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=389.0s)]
*  What's the message? And he's like presidential immunity. Absolutely. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=400.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Got to have presidential immunity. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=403.0s)]
*  It remains the case that no major party in my lifetime has ever, from a purely political perspective, taken on such a reckless endeavor as to nominate a man who is likely to face trial and get convicted smack dab in the middle of the election year while he is the nominee. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=405.0s)]
*  It feels weird to bring this up because I'm like, am I, what am I missing here? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=423.0s)]
*  This is a fact that seemingly only one Republican was willing to acknowledge out loud the guy who dropped out last week. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=430.0s)]
*  Are you convinced that he will be convicted of something in all of this? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=437.0s)]
*  He's going to be convicted this spring in Washington on the January 6th stuff. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=443.0s)]
*  You [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G38pdFTn3xs&t=460.0s)]
