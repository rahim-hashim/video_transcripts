# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Dec. 22
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU)
*  Good afternoon from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Thank you for joining us for a special two-hour, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=0.0s)]
*  four p.m. edition of All In. It's a little under an hour ago. The Supreme Court rejected [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  a proposal from Special Counsel Jack Smith to accelerate a decision on Donald Trump's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=11.58s)]
*  claim of presidential immunity in his federal election criminal interference case. Now, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=16.84s)]
*  one sentence reply, the order from the Supreme Court reads, quote, the petition for writ [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=22.18s)]
*  of certiorari before judgment is denied. In other words, we're not going to speed this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=27.04s)]
*  through. We're not touching it before it goes through the normal appeals process, which [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=32.72s)]
*  is the appellate circuit court in D.C. That outcome is exactly what Special Counsel Smith [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=36.68s)]
*  was hoping to avoid, because the appeals process could give Donald Trump ample time to further [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=42.08s)]
*  delay this case, which is, of course, supposed to go to trial just a few months from now, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=47.92s)]
*  the first week of March. Trump may now try to delay the start of the trial until the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=53.04s)]
*  calendar begins to encroach on next November's general election, at which point, if he's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  the nominee, the ex-president can then ask the court to put the case on pause until the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=62.04s)]
*  presidential contest is decided. And of course, should Trump win that election, the case would [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=66.24s)]
*  go away entirely, which is, to be clear, and what we all understand, including the people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=70.52s)]
*  on the Supreme Court, exactly what he wants. Although, I have to say, it is still unknown [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=75.44s)]
*  if Trump will be allowed to meaningfully delay this trial. And we should note, while [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=80.48s)]
*  the court granting what's called cert before judgment, this sort of leapfrogging that Smith [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=84.64s)]
*  wanted to do, is historically very, very rare, under the Robert Supreme Court, it's been [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=88.36s)]
*  weirdly common. I mean, Robert's Supreme Court has done this 19 times since 2019 alone, according [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  to analysis from Supreme Court expert Steve Vladeck, who has built a lice of work studying [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=101.64s)]
*  this exact, exact procedural wrinkle on everything from affirmative action to a whole bunch [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=106.8s)]
*  of COVID restriction cases to student debt relief. They just reached in and said, no, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=111.92s)]
*  we don't need to hear from the appellate court. We want it now. We want it now. Give it to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=116.84s)]
*  us. But when it comes to the question of whether the man who tried to end American democracy [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=120.52s)]
*  should face trial before voters decide if they want to elect him to finish what he started, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=124.52s)]
*  it appears for now the Magistrate Supreme Court just doesn't appear to be in much of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=129.92s)]
*  a rush. Melissa Murray is a professor at the New York University School of Law. Harry [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=133.32s)]
*  Lippman is a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice. Marcus [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  Childress served as an investigator for the January 6th committee, and they join me now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  So it's great to have all three of you. I got the news and my first thought was like, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=146.12s)]
*  how should I feel about this? So of course I texted Kate, but I'll start with you, Melissa. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=150.32s)]
*  How should I feel? How do you feel? Well, I'm a little surprised. I mean, as you say, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=154.32s)]
*  the Roberts court to grant cert before judgment. They did so with the affirmative action case [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=160.36s)]
*  last year. The first circuit had proceeded and decided the Harvard case, but the Fourth [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  Circuit was still waiting to decide the UNC case, but they took it up on cert anyway. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=168.52s)]
*  They also did the same thing with Biden versus Nebraska, the student loan case. And there's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=173.28s)]
*  a broader historical precedent for this as well. The United States versus Nixon, the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=177.36s)]
*  Supreme Court granted cert before judgment in order to determine whether Richard Nixon [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  had to comply with the request to turn over certain tapes because there was a pending [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=186.12s)]
*  criminal trial of the Watergate burglars. Here, the same kind of equities are in balance. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=190.68s)]
*  It's not simply just a criminal trial that's going on here, but the fact of an election [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=196.72s)]
*  and whether or not the American people deserve to know whether someone that they're voting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=201.16s)]
*  for is able to stand trial on criminal charges. So it seems like they're really important [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=205.28s)]
*  issues at stake here, but the court kind of slow-walked this a little bit. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=210.68s)]
*  So Harry, we know, so the normal procedure here is that there's a district court judgment [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=215.74s)]
*  by Judge Tanya Chukin, who I thought wrote a very strong and persuasive judgment that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=222.5s)]
*  says, look, no, you can't assert presidential immunity for actions that were A, criminal, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=227.5s)]
*  and B, had nothing to do with your official office. You were working as a candidate to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  overthrow the Constitutional Republic. It wasn't like you were overseeing some rulemaking [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  in the Department of Labor, right? So that's persuasive, I think. It then gets appealed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=239.94s)]
*  to the appellate court, D.C. Circuit. Now, they have moved quite quickly. So I guess [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=244.26s)]
*  my question to you is, Smith wanted to move even faster than that, but now it's going [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  to go through that appeals process. So what's your thinking about what this signals for [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  timing here? For timing, I think it probably means maybe [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=257.34s)]
*  a 60-day or so delay, but I think you've just cited, Chris, the pivotal fact, because that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=262.5s)]
*  happened after Smith petitioned for judgment for certiorari before judgment. And by the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=270.02000000000004s)]
*  time it came up to the court, there was the prospect that the D.C. Circuit would be moving [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=277.62s)]
*  very quickly. We already know they're going to have oral argument on this. January 9th [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=284.42s)]
*  will probably issue a decision very quickly thereafter. And I think the court, it decided [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  this whether or not to do it very quickly. I think it's aware of the importance and the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=295.2s)]
*  need for expedition, but it said to itself, you know, we could have a fuller treatment [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  by the D.C. Circuit in just a few weeks. I've written my share of cert memos as a clerk, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=307.88s)]
*  and that's something they really care about, having it full from the D.C. Circuit. And [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  you mentioned the MAGA court, but this was unanimous without dissents. So I think the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=317.88s)]
*  nine who in general are eager to avoid polarized decisions and black eyes coalesced around [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=322.04s)]
*  the idea, let's just wait a few weeks to have the benefit of the D.C. Circuit opinion. And [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=328.88s)]
*  as for the point you make about ultimate timing, even if it delays things, even a couple months, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  we're nevertheless not on the threshold of November. I think they are very aware themselves [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=340.24s)]
*  of the calendar, witness that they jumped on this when asked. And so there, I think [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  the effect is real, but not fatal. Yeah. So that's an important point. Just sometimes [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=351.04s)]
*  cert petitions will come with dissents authored by any of the justices who can write separately [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=357.72s)]
*  and say, look, I think we should have taken this case. In this instance, we don't have [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=363.04s)]
*  that. We don't know. There's no like public, like cert votes are not made public and you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=367.0s)]
*  only need four to grant cert. You don't need a majority. So we don't know for sure, but [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=372.8s)]
*  we know that there's an absence of anyone saying, hey, guys, we should have we should [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=378.0s)]
*  have taken this. Now, there's an interesting procedural move, Marcus, that the Colorado [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=382.35999999999996s)]
*  State Supreme Court used, which I thought was interesting. And Steve Vladeck pointed [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=387.32s)]
*  this out. They basically issued, he says, for those that are worried about Trump slow [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=390.44s)]
*  walking and appeal to SCOTUS, if the D.C. Circuit rules against him on immunity, which [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=394.56s)]
*  I think we all anticipate, the Court of Appeals can preempt that by doing what the Colorado [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=399.28s)]
*  Supreme Court did, a stay that expires, basically a kind of exploding stay, right, a ticking [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=403.6s)]
*  time bomb, a stay that expires unless Trump seeks certiorari within, say, 14 days. So [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=409.52s)]
*  there are some ways the D.C. Circuit itself, Marcus, can also attend to the urgency of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=415.88s)]
*  speed here. Yeah, I agree. And if anyone's aware of how the Trump team and folks associated [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=421.6s)]
*  in like the slow walk, these investigations, it's me from the committee. But I want to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=427.56s)]
*  point to the 11th Circuit. I mean, if we look at that as kind of an indication of how fast [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=431.48s)]
*  these circuit of court opinions can occur, you have to look no further than Mark Meadows [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=437.24s)]
*  just a few weeks ago, right? It's a different issue. It was a removal issue. But the court [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=440.76s)]
*  heard argument on December 15th, I believe, and within like December 18th, we had an opinion. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=444.72s)]
*  And so that's just two or three days. And so I think it is smart by the prosecutors [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=449.44s)]
*  and the special counsel here to seek expedited review at the D.C. Circuit while also seeking [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=453.08s)]
*  review at the Supreme Court, thinking that this might be a real possibility. The Supreme [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=458.2s)]
*  Court wouldn't grant cert here. And so now we have a situation where argument we heard [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=462.52s)]
*  on January 9th. And as the co-panelists have just said, right, that doesn't push back the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=466.28s)]
*  trial date too far. I mean, let's say we push it back 90 days, as was just suggested. A [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=470.88s)]
*  May trial date is still in a good spot for the special counsel's office. Yeah. And I [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=475.48s)]
*  mean, again, all of this sort of circles most of this weird combination of the sort of bizarre [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  kind of real politique of a kind of would-be authoritarian who wants to get office so he [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=488.04s)]
*  can stay out of jail and dismiss the cases against him and wants to forestall any judgment [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=493.44s)]
*  before a jury of his peers and the rules of federal procedure, basically. And then sort [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=499.24s)]
*  of the cherry on top is the rules of federal procedure kind of are what they are until [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  the court decides they want to move things. Like, this is what's so interesting to me. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=510.36s)]
*  When you go back and you look at these cert grants before judgment, there's all these [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=514.44s)]
*  COVID cases. There's that period of time where the Supreme Court was just like every COVID, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=519.0s)]
*  you know, every every local COVID restriction, they were just like hoovering up to the court [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=524.1600000000001s)]
*  time and time again. They wanted they could not wait to get in there to tell basically [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=531.08s)]
*  local governments they couldn't shut things down for COVID. Yeah, I agree. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=535.82s)]
*  I do want to push back a little bit. I know Harry has made clear that, you know, this might result [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=541.48s)]
*  in maybe a 60 or 90 day delay. But a delay is a delay. And there wasn't that much cushion in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=547.24s)]
*  this trial date to begin with. I mean, the November election is coming. There are going [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=553.36s)]
*  to be delays inevitably because this is someone who is determined to delay this. And whether it's [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=558.0s)]
*  because he's on the campaign trail or he's got a convention or whatnot, there will be other delays. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=563.12s)]
*  So this is a tactical victory for Donald Trump, even if it's not necessarily an irrational [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  decision by the Supreme Court. But Chris, you make an excellent point. Where this court saw an [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=574.32s)]
*  opportunity to move jurisprudence in a particular direction on a range of issues of incredible [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=579.28s)]
*  salience to the American public, they did not flinch at the prospect of granting cert before [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=585.28s)]
*  judgment. And we saw it time and time again. They were not interested in a fulsome exposition [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=591.12s)]
*  of the issues in the lower federal courts. They reached in and they grabbed them and they decided [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=596.72s)]
*  them. And they could have done that here, too. And I agree this will be more fully briefed after [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=601.36s)]
*  going through the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit is going to do this with considerable expedition. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=606.72s)]
*  But it is still a delay. And that makes it a victory. Well, yeah. And that, Harry, is the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=610.72s)]
*  that's what's so strange about this. And I think there's a sort of I think you're both right, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  right? Like it's a delay. There's also enough time. There's cushion built in. But it's the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=618.72s)]
*  first delay. And what's so bizarre and surreal about the setting here is that it is it is zero [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=623.36s)]
*  sum in that like literally the number of minutes are a finite amount and they're on the board. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=628.08s)]
*  And the job of Trump's lawyers is just to eat as many of those. So every day that they wake up and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=634.32s)]
*  they gobble some of those minutes off the board and days off the board, like that's a win. And [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=640.0s)]
*  they're going to have a whole bunch of bites at it. Right. There's going to be a whole bunch of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=644.4s)]
*  ways between now and that first day of an actual trial and then a verdict that they are going to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=649.12s)]
*  keep taking those bites. All true, except maybe the last point. Yeah, it's absolutely right. Since [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=654.64s)]
*  Chutkin has held she she was urged by Smith to say, let's go forward with the pretrial stuff, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=661.52s)]
*  just hold the trial. She said, no, I don't have jurisdiction. So a day here equals a day of delay. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=666.88s)]
*  I agree. And I agree with Melissa. It's not in substantial delay. But this was always remember, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=672.4s)]
*  Chris, from the time this motion dropped, we saw this as his big opportunity for delay because it [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  gave him the automatic stay. So he'll try other strategists for sure. But there's reason to believe [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=685.84s)]
*  that Chutkin and the D.C. Circuit, if it comes to it, are pretty much on to them. So I see this [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=691.76s)]
*  as his big shot for delay. I don't know about those other bites at the Apple. He'll try them, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=697.68s)]
*  but I don't think she'll receive them very well. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=702.4799999999999s)]
*  Just weeks after the twenty twenty election, then President Donald Trump personally pressured [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  local officials in Michigan to overturn the vote in the state's largest county. Now, this comes from [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=711.52s)]
*  new reporting by the Detroit News, which obtained recordings of that phone call from November 17th [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  2020. Now, we actually covered this exact story as it was happening, though we didn't know about [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=722.64s)]
*  the recording at eight p.m. on that Tuesday night, just two weeks after the election. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=727.68s)]
*  Breaking news tonight out of Michigan, where two Republican members of the four person [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=733.76s)]
*  board of canvassers in Wayne County, Michigan, who are tasked with certifying the results, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  the election have decided not to do that, citing virtually no evidence of preposterously bad faith [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=743.6s)]
*  mood. Now, Wayne County, of course, the most populous county in the state, it encompasses [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=750.4s)]
*  Detroit. It went for Joe Biden by over three hundred and twenty thousand votes. And the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=754.9599999999999s)]
*  Republican chair of the board, Monica Palmer, is her name's says that she would be open to certifying [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=758.72s)]
*  the vote in communities other than Detroit. This certainly appears to be a flagrant attempt by [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=764.48s)]
*  Republicans to just openly steal an election that Joe Biden won by one hundred and forty thousand [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=770.24s)]
*  votes statewide in Michigan. And on the show, Michigan Secretary of State Democrat Jocelyn Benson [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=777.44s)]
*  told me she would not let this blatant attempt to cheat stand. We have seen multiple attempts to try [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=783.6s)]
*  to disenfranchise and undermine the will of our voters throughout this entire election cycle, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  particularly after the election. Since the American people have spoken, we still see these [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  attempts to misinform or confuse citizens about the validity of the results. So this is simply [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=800.6400000000001s)]
*  an extension of that and a move in the other side's playbook to undermine the will of the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=805.36s)]
*  people. But we're not going to stand for it. We're going to ensure that every valid vote will count [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=810.24s)]
*  and that the certification of our results will be an official reflection of the will of the people. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=814.24s)]
*  But Republicans were defiant. They even celebrated the move. The chair of the state party, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  Laura Cox, state Republican Party, wrote that she was, quote, proud that enough evidence of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=824.4s)]
*  irregularities and potential voter fraud was uncovered, resulting in the Wayne County Board [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=830.0s)]
*  of Canvassers refusing to certify their election results. Of course, that's nonsense. None was [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=834.16s)]
*  uncovered. The president himself tweeted that night, quote, Wow, Michigan just refused to [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=838.64s)]
*  certify the election results. Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=843.12s)]
*  We now know that behind the scenes, Donald Trump was trying to bully the Wayne County [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=848.48s)]
*  Republicans into doing his bidding of going along with the coup. On the recorded call from [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=852.48s)]
*  November 17th, Trump told the two Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=857.36s)]
*  that they would look, quote, terrible if they signed the documents to certify the county's [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=862.32s)]
*  election results after they first voted in opposition. The then president added, quote, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=865.9200000000001s)]
*  We've got to fight for our country. We can't let these people take our country away from us. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=871.12s)]
*  It's kind of interesting, huh? I've heard that rhetoric before. Another point McCall, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=876.08s)]
*  Republican National Committee Chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel. You know her, right? She's on [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=880.72s)]
*  the call, too. She's, you know, helping them out. Tell the Republicans, if you can go home tonight, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=886.24s)]
*  do not sign it. We will get you attorneys. Oh, looks like Nana was part of the coup. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=891.84s)]
*  And Trump concurred, quote, We'll take care of that. Now, luckily, it didn't work. After they [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  hung up the president and after hours of angry responses from Wayne County residents, God bless [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  them, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers abruptly changed course and certified the results of the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=909.76s)]
*  November 3rd election. The following day, the Republican members actually tried to rescind those [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=914.24s)]
*  votes. They both signed affidavits saying they regret their votes, arguing that, quote, intense [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  bullying and coercion plus bad legal advice forced them to agree to certify the election after they [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  had voted no. They were unsuccessful and the certification went forward as it should. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  As Secretary Jocelyn Benson put it, quote, What started as the lowest moment of the post-election [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=932.88s)]
*  melee became the most inspiring. The voters won. Facts and the rule of law carried the day. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=938.24s)]
*  Democracy prevailed. Joining me once again is Michigan Secretary of State [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=942.96s)]
*  Jocelyn Benson. And, Madam Secretary, I want to go back to that period of time because you wrote [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=948.24s)]
*  a long post about it that reminded me of how I was feeling. And I remember having the same kind of, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=952.96s)]
*  wait a second, feeling because what was at issue was that there's a whole bunch of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=958.4s)]
*  statutorily bipartisan boards that don't have a partisan majority on purpose. And the whole point [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=964.0s)]
*  is for them to sort of have this administrative function, which just say like, yep, these numbers [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=971.12s)]
*  line up. We got it. We certify. And that if all of a sudden you start radicalizing the Republicans [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=975.36s)]
*  on those boards to not certify, you can kind of take down the whole integrity of the system. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=982.8s)]
*  And tell me how you were thinking about it as this was playing out. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, not just radicalize the members, but cajole and perhaps even bribe them to break the law, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=993.2s)]
*  to further your political agenda. And thanks, Chris, for having me and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=998.56s)]
*  reminding me that I was with you as all this unfolded play by play. It was quite extraordinary [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1002.4s)]
*  and remarkable to see, especially when you had hundreds of citizens show up and demand, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, very cogently and with the law on their side that their votes count. It was really [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1014.8s)]
*  inspiring to see citizens have more power than the president of the United States even in that moment. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1018.8s)]
*  Yet at the same time, we were also very much aware in that moment that Michigan and Wayne [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1023.44s)]
*  County in Michigan was to be the first domino to fall in what has since really been unveiled [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1029.28s)]
*  as this elaborate national scheme that went all the way to the tragedy at our U.S. Capitol on [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1035.28s)]
*  January 6th, but began with inserting uncertainty and doubt into the certification process in [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  Michigan that would have then been used, as you saw, that Trump's tweet at the time really was [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1047.52s)]
*  setting up to do to challenge the certification in Pennsylvania, which was going the following [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1053.04s)]
*  week, and then Georgia and Wisconsin after that. And so we knew we were the first domino to fall. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1057.52s)]
*  And that's why I was feeling so dejected that night, because if we failed to stop that domino [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1062.24s)]
*  from falling, that was a win for this election subversion attempt. And who knows what could [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1067.6s)]
*  happen next? And thankfully, it didn't fall. The people stood firm, and as a result, the elections [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1074.1599999999999s)]
*  were certified and didn't stop the efforts in other states, as we know, but it certainly made [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1081.2s)]
*  it much more difficult and really paved the way for the failure of the entire effort. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1088.0s)]
*  I think if I'm recalling correctly, and there was a lot going on at the time, I think there was some [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  contemporaneous reporting at the time that the then-President Donald Trump was actually [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1097.68s)]
*  reaching out to these individuals on the canvassing board. But now we've got the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  smoking gun evidence. We've got a recording of the call reported in the Detroit press. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1108.48s)]
*  What do you think about the fact that he is personally calling the Republicans on the [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1114.56s)]
*  Wayne County Board to get them to go along with this plan, putting the full pressure of the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1120.48s)]
*  presidency on them? Yeah, I mean, look, when it happened, we knew. I wasn't surprised. The [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1124.8s)]
*  reporting in the Detroit News was the first time I had learned of this recording, but it didn't [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1130.08s)]
*  surprise me, the content of which we were already well aware that he was trying to pressure these [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1134.16s)]
*  local appointed officials to subvert their own duty, their legal duty under the law. We knew that [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1140.4s)]
*  as it was happening, and it's really, you know, when you're up against the President of the United [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1146.72s)]
*  States, right, the purported leader of the free world, and that we had the truth and the law and [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1152.16s)]
*  the will of the people on our side, it is really harrowing and scary because you don't know, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1158.72s)]
*  ultimately. I mean, democracy is fragile, as that time also revealed to us. And when I was on your [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1165.6799999999998s)]
*  show in that moment, I didn't know how it was all going to play out, but you hope for people to [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1171.1999999999998s)]
*  follow the law and do the best in that moment. And the beauty of that night was that because [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1174.32s)]
*  citizens showed up and demanded democracy prevail, that that's the reason it ultimately did. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1178.08s)]
*  Um, by the way, it's Detroit News, not the Free Press. I want to be clear because it's fantastic [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1182.96s)]
*  reporting and they should get credit where due. You correctly named them, and I didn't. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1188.3200000000002s)]
*  What do you think about the RNC chair and fellow Michigander, Ronna Romney McDaniel, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1192.5600000000002s)]
*  playing the role of essentially accomplice, saying we will, we the RNC will provide you [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1198.0s)]
*  with legal representation to break the law, to flagrantly violate and subvert election law. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1202.48s)]
*  That to me is real news here. The degree to which she was an accomplice in this phone call. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1209.44s)]
*  Well, you know, before that she had held a press conference in Michigan with, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1214.8s)]
*  it was just filled with misinformation and lies about our elections. And so again, no surprise [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1218.3200000000002s)]
*  to me, frankly. Uh, and we know the coordination and the amount of focus on Michigan, uh, was clear [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1223.28s)]
*  as we were living through this. Uh, so I wasn't surprised. It's in some ways validating and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1229.52s)]
*  gratifying to see this additional evidence because in many ways this entire, you know, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1234.64s)]
*  three year battle has been this, this battle between evidence, evidence and proof of fair [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1238.96s)]
*  elections and efforts to subvert it and efforts to confuse the reality, to spread misinformation [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1244.5600000000002s)]
*  about that. So the more proof and evidence we have, as this tape shows, the stronger we feel [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1250.64s)]
*  going into 2024 and all these criminal proceedings that the law and justice will also prevail. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1256.0s)]
*  We'll see, it's still unfolding, but my hope is, is emboldened, I guess, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1262.16s)]
*  and bolstered through this reporting and what's been revealed through this recording. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1266.0800000000002s)]
*  Even special counsel, Jack Smith prepares to take Donald Trump to trial over his attempts to steal [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1272.0s)]
*  the 2020 election. We are still learning new details three years later about the lengths the [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1276.48s)]
*  ex-president went to. As we've covered on the show before, back in November, 2020, two Republican [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1281.52s)]
*  election officials in Wayne County, Michigan, initially refused to certify President Biden's [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1287.52s)]
*  victory there before changing their minds, voting to certify and ending the standoff. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1293.36s)]
*  Just 30 minutes after that meeting ended, Trump called the two officials urging them to reverse [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1297.6s)]
*  course again and go back to blocking Biden's victory. Now we know finally what Trump said [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1302.48s)]
*  on that call, thanks to great reporting by the Detroit News. Joined by none other than RNC chair [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1308.16s)]
*  Ronna Romney McDaniel, Trump promised to provide attorneys for the two officials. He also told the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1314.0s)]
*  pair they would look quote terrible if they signed the official certification document, adding quote, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1319.68s)]
*  we've got to fight for our country. We can't let these people take our country away from us. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1324.48s)]
*  Following the call, the two canvassers then did try to do what Trump asked and undo their [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1330.24s)]
*  vote to certify Biden's victory. Thankfully, the plan did not work. The ship had sailed, as it were, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1335.04s)]
*  notably when pressed about the calls three years ago, because we knew calls were happening. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  One of the election officials, Monica Palmer, said Trump was merely checking in on her well-being. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1344.88s)]
*  The portions of the call reviewed by the Detroit News did not include comments by [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1352.4s)]
*  Trump to that effect. We should note, NBC News has not independently verified these recordings, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1356.4s)]
*  but as the Detroit News notes, neither Palmer nor McDaniel and Trump, through spokespeople, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1361.68s)]
*  disputed a summary of the call when contacted by the news. The second Wayne County canvasser, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1366.48s)]
*  William Hartman, died in 2021. Joining me now are Lisa Rubin, MSNBC legal analyst and George [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1371.68s)]
*  Conway, conservative attorney. There's a lot to talk about. I want to talk about the sort of new [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1377.44s)]
*  revelations coming out of Michigan and what they could mean, particularly what they might mean for [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1381.52s)]
*  both Jack Smith's case and other state-based cases. But also because we've got this Supreme Court [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1386.08s)]
*  denial of cert before judgment, I want to get your reactions to it because we've been sort of [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1390.72s)]
*  asking different legal folks what they think. George, if I'm not mistaken, you worked on the [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1395.12s)]
*  Jones v. Clinton brief on the side of Paula Jones, which was an immunity case in a civil context, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  saying President Clinton should have to sit for a deposition. He was not entitled immunity. You [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  guys won that case 9-0, so you know immunity doctrine at the Supreme Court. What do you make [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1411.84s)]
*  of this cert petition denial? Yeah, I'm the only person I think in the universe who's written a [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1417.12s)]
*  brief that's defeated a claim of presidential immunity, 9-0, nothing, I think. And I think [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1421.44s)]
*  today's order is not a big deal. I see a lot of people, their hair is on fire. They can just douse [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1427.44s)]
*  their hair in water because this isn't a big deal. I don't think it's really going to affect the [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1433.44s)]
*  trial date that much. The worst case is the trial gets pushed to the summer. And the reason is I [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1438.16s)]
*  think this order shows the weakness of Trump's immunity case. And I think the court realizes [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1443.92s)]
*  it's got the D.C. Circuit that's going to basically hear argument on January 9th. It's not a hard case. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  I think they're going to move very quickly. If I were the presiding judge of the panel, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1457.44s)]
*  I'd already be writing the opinion. And once they rule, they can lift the stay. They can issue a [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1460.64s)]
*  mandate and lift the stay, which means then you're going to have Donald Trump saying, oh, we need [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1465.44s)]
*  expedition, we need expedition. And the Supreme Court could grant that and hear the case. They [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1470.08s)]
*  could hear it in April and May, decide it in June, decide it in May, and still have a summer trial. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1473.9199999999998s)]
*  Or better yet, they could deny the case, sir, because he's already had his argument in the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1478.48s)]
*  Court of Appeals before a very, very distinguished panel. And Donald Trump should be, frankly, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1484.8s)]
*  treated like every other criminal who's been convicted in a federal district court and be [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  forced to litigate his arguments after his conviction. And he can challenge his conviction [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1496.08s)]
*  with every other claim after he's convicted and sent it. So I just don't think this is a big deal. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1502.48s)]
*  I think this case is going to get tried one way or the other in April, May, June, July. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1507.28s)]
*  This case is going to trial, and Donald Trump is not going to be able to stop it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1512.56s)]
*  That's interesting. I mean, there's a few things, Lisa, that are interesting to me. One, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1516.08s)]
*  Andrew Weissman talked about just sort of professional courtesy and deference from [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1521.36s)]
*  the Supreme Court to the D.C. Circuit, which, of course, is sort of the first among equals [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1525.04s)]
*  in the valid courts. It's sitting right there in D.C. So there's that. There's the advantage of, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1529.52s)]
*  to George's point, what I think is interesting is when you've got something that is pretty [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1534.0s)]
*  clear-cut, rather than having one quite clear-cut opinion in which Judge Huntington says, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1537.04s)]
*  not a tough call, to have two opinions that say, this is not a tough call, and then take that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1542.96s)]
*  What do you think? Look, Chris, to the extent that the Trump brief was persuasive here, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1550.08s)]
*  I think it was persuasive on the point that Judge Chuckin's opinion denying immunity for [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1556.24s)]
*  criminal prosecution, where you're talking about a sitting or former president, is the first of its [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1561.76s)]
*  kind. And Trump's brief argued, you, Supreme Court, should want to have another body of law before you [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1566.56s)]
*  before you make this most important of decisions. We're not disagreeing that this eventually warrants [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1572.8799999999999s)]
*  your review. We're just saying not now. And I thought that was probably the most persuasive [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1578.0s)]
*  argument in their brief. In terms of what I think the D.C. Circuit is going to do, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1582.88s)]
*  I tend to think that this D.C. Circuit is going to make a decision on immunity that's more symmetrical [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1587.2s)]
*  with the rule in civil cases and say, yes, maybe a president is entitled to immunity, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1592.48s)]
*  where you're talking about allegedly criminal actions at the outer periphery of their official [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1598.24s)]
*  duties. But based on the allegations in this indictment, taking them on their face, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1603.36s)]
*  what they are alleging that he did doesn't even get close to that periphery, and therefore the [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  case can be tried. I think they want the cover of a D.C. Circuit opinion that says that, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1613.4399999999998s)]
*  based on a decision earlier this month in the civil context, in the D.C. Circuit, I think the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1618.1599999999999s)]
*  D.C. Circuit is well positioned to extend that rule of the criminal context and give the court [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1623.36s)]
*  the cover that it needs. Yeah, this is the outer perimeter sort of doctrine that is both sort of [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1627.76s)]
*  suggested by other cases in this line and also explicitly invoked in the Trump brief. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1634.0s)]
*  George, let's talk about what's coming out of Michigan. There's a few things striking about it [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1640.8799999999999s)]
*  to me. One is that, I don't know, where did they get the tape from? Now we've got the tape. But [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1645.52s)]
*  also just like, it's so wild how in the weeds the guy was. I mean, that's the president of the United [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1649.68s)]
*  States. You know this because you have worked in politics and you've been around the various layers [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1655.92s)]
*  that go around principles, as they're often called, right? Who they talk to on the phone, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1662.88s)]
*  what's a staff job, what's the principal's job? Like, the president on the phone with the wing [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1668.0s)]
*  cameras, it's just like there's nothing he won't do. There's no links he won't go to to get this [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1674.4s)]
*  done. Yeah, I mean, he's a complete nut job. And it's just like what he did in Georgia. Remember, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1680.72s)]
*  he didn't just call Secretary of State Raffensperger, he called an investigator, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1686.56s)]
*  a lowly investigator in the Georgia Department of whatever. I didn't even know what it is. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1693.6799999999998s)]
*  To jawbone that poor woman. She's getting talking to the president of the United States, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1699.9199999999998s)]
*  nut job. And so, you know, it's just crazy. It just shows you what a lunatic he is and how extreme [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1703.76s)]
*  he is and how corrupt he is. Because this is just, he's basically on the basis of lies, on the basis [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1709.6799999999998s)]
*  of no facts. He's urging a public official to basically violate their oath to the law of the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1715.04s)]
*  state of Michigan into the Constitution. It's crazy and corrupt. And I got to say this about [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1721.44s)]
*  my former political party. You know, I mean, Ron Romney McDaniel, the woman who changed her name [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1726.32s)]
*  so that wouldn't displease Donald Trump. I mean, this is just the sleaziest thing ever. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  Whether or not it's criminal, we'll set that aside. It's just the sleaziest thing ever. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1738.08s)]
*  And if my former political party had any decency or shame, she'd be out on her ass. Forgive my [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1741.52s)]
*  language. Yeah, yeah, it is. I do find it actually quite revealing and shocking that she's on the [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  call and she's saying, we'll pay for your lawyers as well. There's also an interesting angle to this, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1756.6399999999999s)]
*  Lisa, which is we have seen, and I think there's a sort of a little bit of a Fonny Willis effect, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1760.56s)]
*  which is, you know, all eyes were on the Justice Department from the beginning of this. But [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1766.4s)]
*  it's pretty clear that there are all sorts of colorable claims in a bunch of jurisdictions [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1771.68s)]
*  that state law was violated. And now we've seen cases brought against, you know, the sort of fake [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1776.4s)]
*  electors in Michigan. There's a case now in Nevada. There's maybe one coming in Arizona. There is the [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1781.52s)]
*  one in Georgia that names them. There were, alongside with the federal case and the Fonny [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  Willis case, there were many state laws that plausibly were broken in pursuit of this scheme. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1792.3200000000002s)]
*  That's absolutely true. And we now know, Chris, based on this reporting, that there were at least [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1799.12s)]
*  four recorded calls. There are the two calls that George was mentioning earlier in Georgia to Brad [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1805.84s)]
*  Raffensperger and the woman who was the investigator. Her name is Frances Watson. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  Then there was the call that just got reported in Michigan. And I also want to remind you that [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1814.72s)]
*  there's a fourth call to now deceased Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, who provided a copy of that [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1818.56s)]
*  recording to the special purpose grand jury that Fonny Willis convened. So we now know that this guy [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1824.64s)]
*  who infamously doesn't text, doesn't email, was foiled by the smartphone era and by a bunch of [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1829.76s)]
*  quick thinking folks who, when he made these very granular, weedy calls to the Wayne County [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1836.16s)]
*  commissioners, fired up the phone and fired the otter, I guess, to record him having these [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1840.8000000000002s)]
*  conversations, giving rise to, as you note, potentially some state law claims, but also [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1846.3200000000002s)]
*  additional evidence of the wrongdoing in Jack Smith's case. Yes. Also, you're firing up the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1851.92s)]
*  recorder, the iPhone recorder, not because you're like, this is a cool souvenir. You're firing it up [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1858.48s)]
*  as Brad Raffensperger because like, this is really legally objectionable. And I immediately need [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  some evidence to cover myself from what might be a blatant act of criminality. I think that's fairly [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1871.3600000000001s)]
*  clear. If I were going into a phone call with a criminal, I would record it too. And let me, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1877.68s)]
*  there's one other thing too. I mean, we forget about the one other call, the one that almost [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  happened. Remember Governor Doug Ducey, when he was signing the electoral certificates, he's sitting [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1887.68s)]
*  there, the press is there, they're taking the pictures and all of a sudden his phone rings in [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1894.0s)]
*  his pocket. It's hail to the chief. He takes his phone out of his pocket and puts it down and turns [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1899.2s)]
*  it off. I mean, Trump is completely insane. I forgot that detail. And one thing about the state [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1904.8s)]
*  laws, I mean, you know, here it's, I think the one wrinkle to this particular case, I think if I were [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1912.6399999999999s)]
*  the defense lawyers here for Ronna, Romney, McDaniel and Donald Trump and whoever, the thing [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1918.72s)]
*  they got going for them is that these people had already certified the results and they didn't have [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  the power to uncertify it. So in a sense, they were being asked to do something they couldn't [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1930.96s)]
*  do. And that may have, that could affect the legal, the legal effect of what they did. And, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1936.0s)]
*  but other than that, it's just sleazy, sleazy as hell. And it can be used in Jack Smith's case, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1940.96s)]
*  which I think can go to trial in March and April, as I said, and in, and in Fonny Willis's case to [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1947.04s)]
*  show their criminal intent. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFXOnl-9AU&t=1951.92s)]
