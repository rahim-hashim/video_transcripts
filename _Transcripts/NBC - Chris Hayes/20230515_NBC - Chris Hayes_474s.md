# Report: Gosar's congressional staffer linked to neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY)
*  And now we have new reporting from Hunter Walker at Talking Points Memo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=0.0s)]
*  He uncovered evidence that a congressional staffer, the digital director for Congressman [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=3.84s)]
*  Paul Gosar of Arizona, is a prominent follower of a neo-Nazi named Nick Fuentes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=8.44s)]
*  You may remember Fuentes as the racist Holocaust denier who Kanye West brought to dinner at [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=13.64s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago with Donald J. Trump last year. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=18.22s)]
*  So what does all of this tell us? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=21.76s)]
*  But the right in America has mainstreamed a very dangerous, violent movement, a threat [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=24.8s)]
*  to us all. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=29.92s)]
*  And if you needed any further proof of that, just look at the tragedy that unfolded last [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=30.92s)]
*  weekend in Allen, Texas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=35.52s)]
*  The man who opened fire in an outlet mall and killed eight people, including a three-year-old, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=37.28s)]
*  expressed interest in white supremacists and neo-Nazi views. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  And yet the denialism and whataboutism on the right sadly persists. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=46.96s)]
*  Joining me now, Hunter Walker is the investigative reporter for Talking Points Memo, who I just [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=52.52s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=56.4s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giatt is a professor of history at New York University and the author of The [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=57.4s)]
*  Lucid Substack, where she writes about democracy and autocracy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=60.44s)]
*  And Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist for The New York Times. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=64.06s)]
*  Thank you all for joining me tonight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=67.08s)]
*  Hunter, let me start with you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=68.68s)]
*  Tell us more about your reporting. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=70.08s)]
*  How close is this Gosar staffer to Nick Fuentes and his gripper movement? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=71.34s)]
*  So Nick Fuentes referred to Chicken Right, the online persona that can be linked to this [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=76.96s)]
*  staffer, as one of his best quote-unquote soldiers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=82.33999999999999s)]
*  I also watched one of these extended Nick Fuentes streams where the chicken persona [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=86.52s)]
*  pledged loyalty to Nick Fuentes and to the white race. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  And there are extensive links between this online persona, which was fairly prominent, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=96.44s)]
*  amassing over 20,000 followers in Nick Fuentes' movement and two staffers actually in Gosar's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=101.08s)]
*  office. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  When the accounts first launched, they were credited to quote Wade and Landon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Wade Searle is Gosar's digital director. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=113.32s)]
*  Landon Peterson is an intern in the office. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  These accounts then ultimately tweeted photos that appear to be Wade Searle with Nick Fuentes [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=119.46s)]
*  when he attended a Nick Fuentes rally. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=124.2s)]
*  They were tweeting from his hometown. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=126.44s)]
*  They were also tweeting indicating they were about the same age as him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=129.2s)]
*  So there's really extensive links. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=133.44s)]
*  And this is not just some run-of-the-mill follower of Nick Fuentes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  This is also someone who was in internal leadership chats telling the grippers, Nick Fuentes' [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=139.0s)]
*  movement, what was going on in Gosar's office. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=144.76s)]
*  And he was creating these videos and content and propaganda for the movement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  So this is a high-profile gripper now working directly creating content for a U.S. congressman. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=151.44s)]
*  I'm shocked that that congressman, I'm shocked that congressman is Paul Gosar. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=158.28s)]
*  Ruth, moving from Paul Gosar to Tommy Tuberville, what did you make of Tuberville's conflation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  of white supremacists and Nazis with MAGA supporters and Trump supporters? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=168.68s)]
*  Well, it makes perfect sense because Trump has been, you know, cultivating extremists. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned the very fine, you know, people neo-Nazi episode. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=181.96s)]
*  But what we've got now is that Trump is openly, you know, appealing to people as a violent [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  cult leader. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=192.08s)]
*  He's not a conventional politician. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=193.08s)]
*  He's a cult leader. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=195.04s)]
*  And it's quite extraordinary. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  It's like all of the white, all of the right-wing extremists from the entire 20th century, their [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=198.44s)]
*  representatives and inheritors are now, you know, grouped around Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  So you've got the neo-Nazis, you've got fascists, you've got people who love Pinochet and the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=209.96s)]
*  military juntas, the proud boys who wear shirts that say Pinochet did nothing wrong, all the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=214.88s)]
*  way up to the new right, you know, of Orban and Putin, and of course, historical racism [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=220.88s)]
*  and white Christian nationalism. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=227.72s)]
*  Michael Flynn, all of that is, has like had a confluence around Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=229.56s)]
*  So I'm not surprised at all. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=235.8s)]
*  This is part of the culture that is the GOP today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=237.36s)]
*  And I believe Donald Trump promised over the weekend to bring Michael Flynn back if he's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  re-elected to office. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=244.68s)]
*  Jamel, while it is very good that President Biden is speaking out against the white supremacist [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=246.12s)]
*  domestic terror threat, I have to ask, where is the broader political media legislative [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  strategy from Democrats, from liberals, from the left, for counteracting this mainstreaming [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=257.36s)]
*  of white supremacy in front of our very eyes on the right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=262.88s)]
*  You know, I don't know if there's a broad strategy here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=265.0s)]
*  I think that part of what makes talking about this so difficult, you showed this clips of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=270.8s)]
*  folks on Fox News kind of dismissing this as ridiculous, is that I'm not really sure [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=276.24s)]
*  that American political culture in general has any real way of talking about this or [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=280.8s)]
*  discussing this or preparing for it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=286.24s)]
*  You mentioned the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and that's instructive for a lot of reasons. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=289.28s)]
*  Obviously, as you said, the most deadly act of domestic terrorism in American history. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  But in the wake of that bombing, there is a real reluctance to talk about the racial [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  ideology at Timothy McBain and the people who helped organize it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=306.44s)]
*  And that kind of continued afterwards. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=310.04s)]
*  You could talk about domestic extremism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=312.32s)]
*  You could talk about the militia movement. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=314.32s)]
*  But talking specifically about white supremacist ideology is difficult. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=316.48s)]
*  And even, you know, we're in 2023. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=321.96s)]
*  We have over the past seven or eight years, a number of shootings, mass shootings by [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=324.28s)]
*  avowed white supremacist people with that ideology, the Charleston shooting to the Tree [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=330.36s)]
*  of Life shooting in 2018 to the Allen, Texas shooting most recently. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=334.96s)]
*  This is a regular occurrence. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=340.8s)]
*  This kind of violence in American life, Biden's right to call it a serious threat. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=342.96s)]
*  And yet, beyond just the political system, I think Americans have a really tough time [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  beginning to think of it as ideological and think of it as a threat deserving a concerted [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=353.36s)]
*  response. And it's not simply people with hate in their heart. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=360.8s)]
*  It's something much more sinister and much more dangerous. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=363.76s)]
*  But Jamel, you don't need to worry, because I am absolutely sure that Kevin McCarthy is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  about to take action against Paul Gosar. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=372.56s)]
*  Isn't he, Hunter? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=374.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  I've reached out to the speaker's office for comment. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=377.68s)]
*  I've reached out to Paul Gosar for comment. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=379.92s)]
*  And the only thing we've seen is Paul Gosar actually shutting off replies on his Twitter [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=382.0s)]
*  feed. And I'm not surprised by that, honestly, because Paul Gosar, as you alluded to, has [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  one of the most, you know, extreme histories in the current Congress. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=390.64s)]
*  He's, you know, sent out links to anti-Semitic newsletters. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  He's appeared twice at Nick Fuentes's political conference. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=400.8s)]
*  And this was a bit of an open secret on the far right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=404.8s)]
*  They were tweeting about how this guy was on his staff. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=407.52s)]
*  That's sort of how I caught on to it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=410.28s)]
*  Researchers in Arizona like Haley Orion and Nick Martin, who I worked with, were chasing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=412.2s)]
*  this stuff. We put it all together, but I don't think we're going to see action. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=417.4s)]
*  And part of that is because of what we're talking about right now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=421.44s)]
*  I think Senator Tuberville said the quiet part out loud. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=425.12s)]
*  You know, this is the modern Republican Party. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=428.24s)]
*  White nationalism is a part of it and explicitly so. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=431.28s)]
*  You see people like Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene, you know, embrace the term [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=435.04s)]
*  Christian nationalism. That clip you played before where they're attacking DEI. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=439.04s)]
*  These are white supremacist talking points. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=442.92s)]
*  And, you know, what my reporting is trying to do is just expose how deep and extreme [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=445.28s)]
*  this goes and that it's actually tying directly to neo-Nazism. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hta235TfCIY&t=449.8s)]
