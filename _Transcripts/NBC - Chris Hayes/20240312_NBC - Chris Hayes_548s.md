# Must see: Trump v. Biden in 21 charts
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY)
*  Joe Biden is officially the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=0.0s)]
*  His 2024 reelection campaign begins full force. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=4.3s)]
*  He will be running primarily on his record, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  What he has gotten done with the American people over the last four years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=10.6s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=13.3s)]
*  This election's interesting and different. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=14.8s)]
*  For the first time since 1892, when President Benjamin Harrison faced a rematch [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=16.7s)]
*  against his predecessor, Grover Cleveland, Biden will be running against the man [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=22.8s)]
*  who held the office just before him, the man he beat, the man who didn't want to leave. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=27.2s)]
*  It sets up one of the most clear-cut apples-to-apples comparisons possible [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=32.1s)]
*  in a presidential election, right? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=36.2s)]
*  Usually one of the people is an incumbent, the other is just sort of like talking [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=37.6s)]
*  about what they would do. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=40.5s)]
*  They don't have a record. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=41.7s)]
*  But here, in this case, you got two records to compare. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=43.0s)]
*  How is the country doing when Donald Trump was president as he catastrophically bungled [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=46.3s)]
*  the response to a once-in-a-century pandemic and then left in disgrace, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=50.6s)]
*  having fomented an unsuccessful coup and getting impeached for it? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=54.3s)]
*  And how are things now, four years later, under this President Joe Biden? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=58.4s)]
*  There is quite a story to tell about the general trajectory of American life [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=63.099999999999994s)]
*  in the last four years. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=66.7s)]
*  And we just so happen to have some visual aids to help tell that story. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=67.7s)]
*  We're going to show you some charts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=71.3s)]
*  And here's the thing about the charts, all right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=72.8s)]
*  Generally, you want the good stuff to go up and the bad stuff to come down, okay? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=75.0s)]
*  Pretty simple. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=82.0s)]
*  You want to see good stuff go up, bad stuff come down. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=82.8s)]
*  So this is how that looks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=85.2s)]
*  Let's just start with GDP, gross domestic product. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=86.1s)]
*  That is the measure and the value of all goods and services produced in the United States, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=89.6s)]
*  It's the size of the U.S. economy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=94.0s)]
*  And like the rest of the world, we saw a significant drop. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=95.8s)]
*  See when it goes down there, the constriction, that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=98.8s)]
*  In GDP in 2020, that was the pandemic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=101.5s)]
*  That was under Donald Trump's watch. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=104.2s)]
*  But just look at the recovery in the four years since. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=106.2s)]
*  Look at that, go up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=109.1s)]
*  In fact, the U.S. had the strongest recovery of all of its peers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=110.7s)]
*  Every country faced similar headwinds and challenges. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=115.4s)]
*  Last year, our economy grew faster than any other nation in the G7. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  When you zoom in a little further, now showing only the Biden years, it's essentially a straight line going up. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  That was not foreordained. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=128.7s)]
*  A lot could have gone wrong. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=131.1s)]
*  It's hard to pick yourself back up from the once in a century pandemic and the disruptions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=132.2s)]
*  We've seen this growth now reflected in the stock market. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=137.0s)]
*  Again, start low, go high, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=139.4s)]
*  Four years ago, Dow plunged. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=143.6s)]
*  Recording its worst ever drop in a single day on March 16th, 2020, almost exactly four years ago. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=144.1s)]
*  Under President Donald Trump, he was obsessed with the stock market. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=149.5s)]
*  Four years later, not only is it back on track, it hit an all-time record high at the end of last month. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Once again, over the past year, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=159.3s)]
*  From here to there, getting better. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=162.3s)]
*  Now, there's a bunch of reasons for this really remarkable economic performance and growth in this era, the Biden era, last few years. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=166.2s)]
*  Jobs have really bounced back. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=174.0s)]
*  Labor force participation rate, that's the percentage of people who are in the labor force, really increasing steadily from the COVID era lows, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  It hit lows during the pandemic and then it goes up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  New business applications. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=186.7s)]
*  This is people starting businesses, which is, you know, the American dream. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  In 2023 alone, Americans filed five and a half million new business applications. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=191.9s)]
*  That was a record high for the year. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=196.0s)]
*  In fact, that was the third year in a row of record breaking applications for a total of 16 million over the first three years of Biden administration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=198.8s)]
*  Starts down here, goes up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=206.7s)]
*  Manufacturing is also booming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=209.3s)]
*  Thanks to a flurry of Biden signed legislation, more and more goods being produced in America again, bringing good paying manufacturing jobs back into the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=211.6s)]
*  See? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=222.3s)]
*  See how that goes? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=223.1s)]
*  Hospitality jobs in particular have bounced back after plummeting after the pandemic. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=224.9s)]
*  Again, not a given the industry will recover fully post-COVID. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=230.4s)]
*  You see it go down here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=234.8s)]
*  But travels back. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=237.0s)]
*  We can see from the number of passengers flying on U.S. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=238.3s)]
*  Airlines when Joe, this is the summer of 2020, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=241.5s)]
*  In the depths. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=244.5s)]
*  Up to now, July 2023 across the board. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=246.6s)]
*  And this is key. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=250.0s)]
*  Wages are rising, rising, fast inflation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=251.3s)]
*  I mean, wages rising in real terms. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=253.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=257.1s)]
*  Workers now make an average of more than thirty four dollars an hour. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=257.8s)]
*  Earnings are outpacing inflation crucially. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=260.6s)]
*  That means there is more money in American's pockets to spend. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=264.2s)]
*  Disposable personal income. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=268.1s)]
*  This is one of the most important charts here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  Took a huge hit when COVID support ended inflation spiked. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  It was really bad on people's balance sheets. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=275.5s)]
*  Now it's on the right track. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  This is the last two years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=280.5s)]
*  Having significantly increased in the last years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=281.7s)]
*  From down here to up there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=284.9s)]
*  Another thing we're doing in the last four years, we're producing more of our own energy here in the U.S. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=288.29999999999995s)]
*  Crude oil production. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=293.2s)]
*  Basically, no one in America knows this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  So listen closely. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  Crude oil production under Democratic President Joe Biden broke records last year. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  It is outpacing projections so far in 2024. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=303.0s)]
*  In fact, we're producing right now more oil than any other nation ever has at any time ever. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=306.0s)]
*  Now you might say, as I do when I say that sentence, from a climate perspective, not great. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=313.29999999999995s)]
*  Which true, but crucially also renewable power is booming. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=318.0s)]
*  Renewable power generation is also up amid President Biden's three hundred and seventy billion dollar investment in clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=323.7s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=333.5s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  Remember they named it that? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=334.9s)]
*  Not necessarily because it was an inflation bill, but because of this chart. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  Inflation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=340.7s)]
*  This is the this is the whole story of the last four years in some way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  It's the reason I think that Joe Biden's faced political headwinds. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=344.9s)]
*  This is also the story in every other country on earth. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=348.7s)]
*  Inflation has had a rocky ride since the pandemic and the massive supply chain interruptions it brought. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=351.7s)]
*  The consumer price index. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  That's the measurement, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=359.0s)]
*  The average price of goods and services hit nine percent in the summer of 2022 right there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=361.5s)]
*  And that was bad. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=368.4s)]
*  It caused severe financial strain for people. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=369.5s)]
*  And crucially, this is a global phenomenon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=372.3s)]
*  Happened basically everywhere. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=374.5s)]
*  But look at this since then, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=376.1s)]
*  It has come way down. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=378.0s)]
*  It's now hovering at three percent. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=379.8s)]
*  Again, this was not guaranteed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=381.2s)]
*  If you go read the economic press back here, people were like, we're going to need a recession or it's going to keep going up forever or we're screwed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=383.3s)]
*  Or we're walking the catastrophe. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=390.2s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=391.8s)]
*  It has come down to three percent. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=393.4s)]
*  And like economic growth, this is better than basically any of our peer countries. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=395.3s)]
*  They would all trade places to be us. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=401.2s)]
*  The unemployment rate has also dropped massively after hitting an unprecedented spike of nearly 15 percent in 2020. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. The same story in the chart. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=410.2s)]
*  Bad things happen in 2020. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=412.0s)]
*  And then they get better after Donald Trump leaves office. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=413.9s)]
*  Over the past couple of years, the Biden presidency, unemployment has actually been hovering below four percent for an unprecedentedly long period of time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=418.5s)]
*  In the past year, amid all these economic improvements, mortgage rates, which have risen quite a bit as the Federal Reserve hiked rates, have started coming down as well, which is welcome. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=427.7s)]
*  We're seeing gas prices drop. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=438.9s)]
*  Remember, remember this story from a spike in nearly five dollars per gallon the summer of 2022. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=440.6s)]
*  Putting on their Joe Biden stickers on gas pumps saying I did that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  You don't see that so much anymore because we're now down to a little over three dollars per gallon. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=451.3s)]
*  They start up here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=455.0s)]
*  They go down there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=456.0s)]
*  And finally, and this is the one conservatives love to get wrong, one we're obsessed with here in the show. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=458.5s)]
*  There has been a big decrease in violent crime under President Biden. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=463.4s)]
*  Twenty twenty was one of the most dangerous years in America in decade under Trump. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  Violent crime spiked around the country. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=473.8s)]
*  It spiked in both urban and rural areas. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  But in every year, the Biden administration, violent crime has come down. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=477.8s)]
*  In fact, according to the latest estimates, twenty twenty three is on track to have one of the lowest violent crime rates in half a century. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=482.6s)]
*  So compared to four years ago when Donald Trump was president, these are just the facts. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=490.7s)]
*  Okay. The country is safer. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=495.0s)]
*  It is more prosperous. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=496.90000000000003s)]
*  It is more energy independent. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=498.1s)]
*  There are more people working and making higher wages. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=499.7s)]
*  More people starting new businesses, more people working in manufacturing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=502.6s)]
*  The last year of the last president's term of Donald Trump's term was a nightmare. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=508.1s)]
*  And because it was a nightmare, it's easy to block out. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=514.7s)]
*  But look how far the country's come. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=517.6s)]
*  This is what has been achieved under President Joe Biden. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=519.7s)]
*  And it is the pitch you can expect him to be making to voters all this year. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=523.2s)]
*  You [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSFk0N36EY&t=532.6s)]
