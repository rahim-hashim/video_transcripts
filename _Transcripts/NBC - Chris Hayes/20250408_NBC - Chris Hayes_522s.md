Video Description: Michigan attorney Amir Makled was detained by federal agents on his way home from a spring break trip with his family. His only crime appears to be representing a student protestor. “We're seeing a chilling effect on not just individuals and their rights, but also on the attorneys representing these individuals,” Makled tells Chris Hayes.

# ‘They’re attacking attorneys’: Lawyer representing student protestor detained
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0)
*  They're going to keep pushing and pushing until something stops them. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=0.0s)]
*  And then yesterday we saw an absolutely chilling story out of Michigan, where immigration agents [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=4.0s)]
*  detained and demanded to search the phone of an American citizen at the Detroit airport [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=8.84s)]
*  after he returned from a vacation with his wife and two daughters. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=15.46s)]
*  His name is Amir Maqlid, and he broke no laws. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  He's a lawyer himself, and his only infraction, at least as far as we can tell in the eyes [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=22.36s)]
*  of the Trump administration, appears to be that he represents a pro-Palestinian demonstrator [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=26.46s)]
*  who was arrested at the University of Michigan last year. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=31.82s)]
*  And that attorney, Amir Maqlid, joins me now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=35.34s)]
*  Mr. Maqlid, it's great to have you on the program. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=37.86s)]
*  Just take me through. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=40.9s)]
*  I think you were on a vacation in the Dominican Republic. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=41.9s)]
*  You land in Detroit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  You got to go through customs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=46.66s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=47.66s)]
*  Well, what happens next is when I get to the immigration checkpoint and I speak to a passport [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=50.46s)]
*  officer, they ran my passport, which happens routinely whenever you're coming in through [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=55.779999999999994s)]
*  the border. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  But the strange part is the agent looked up and looked to another government officer and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  asked if the TTRT team was available. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=67.97999999999999s)]
*  And I didn't recognize an acronym, so I did a quick Google search while I was just standing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=71.82s)]
*  at the desk there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=75.42s)]
*  And it turns out that term meant the tactical terrorism response team, which dropped my [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=76.42s)]
*  heart into my stomach. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=83.28s)]
*  I almost nearly hit the floor thinking about what the heck that could be about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=84.44s)]
*  And so I looked over at my wife and I said, honey, they're going to take me in for questioning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=87.64s)]
*  I'm pretty confident that they're going to ask me to step into an interview room. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=91.52s)]
*  And lo and behold, another agent comes out and says, sir, follow me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=96.04s)]
*  And so as I'm walking into the interview room, I asked my wife and children for you to leave. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=100.04s)]
*  And they said yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=106.08s)]
*  So my wife and kids waited outside for nearly two hours while I was being interrogated by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Customs and Border Protection officers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  What's interesting in this situation is that as I was sitting in an interview room, a plain [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=117.56s)]
*  clothed agent who wouldn't identify himself to me asked me if I was carrying my cell phone. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=122.08s)]
*  And I said yes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=129.88s)]
*  And he says, well, first off, let me just say this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=130.88s)]
*  We know who you are. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=132.6s)]
*  We know that you're an attorney. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=133.6s)]
*  And we know that you represent some high profile clients. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=134.96s)]
*  And the only high profile case that I'm involved in right now is the representation of a young [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=138.36s)]
*  lady named Samantha Lewis. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=142.32s)]
*  And she's involved at the University of Michigan and was engaged in political speech and protesting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=143.64s)]
*  against the war in Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=149.64s)]
*  And in our defense, we're going after the criminalization of free speech in the University [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=152.32s)]
*  of Michigan case. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=157.44s)]
*  And so we've made a lot of public remarks about that topic. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=158.88s)]
*  And we've stood tall with our clients on that issue. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  So as this conversation with this agent was going, he said, listen, he has me a pamphlet, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=165.04s)]
*  which had a federal statute on it and said, listen, we're allowed to take your phone, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=169.84s)]
*  even if you're an American citizen, and we can hold it for several days or weeks even, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=174.56s)]
*  and then give it back to you once we're done going through it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=179.56s)]
*  Or you can comply with us right now, give us the password, and let us go through it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=182.52s)]
*  And I said to them, well, guys, you already know, there's two agents in the room. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=186.8s)]
*  You already know that I'm an attorney. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  And you know that a substantial amount of my work is going to be on my phone. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  And in these days, everything's electronic anyways. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=194.68s)]
*  You know, there's nothing left to paper filings in court. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=197.36s)]
*  I have my entire, all my emails, my text messages, all my files, my work product. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  It's all contained in my phone. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=206.44s)]
*  And so I tell them, everything that's in my phone could be considered work privilege [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=208.12s)]
*  and is attorney-client privilege. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=211.52s)]
*  You have no right or authority to go through the contents of my phone, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=212.8s)]
*  especially because you know I'm an attorney, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=216.52s)]
*  and I'm not giving you that unfettered access to my phone. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=218.52s)]
*  They said, listen, we could do this two ways. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=222.0s)]
*  Either we could take your phone, and you're not [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=223.88s)]
*  going to have a phone for several days, or you can just give us the access. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=225.88s)]
*  I said, I'm not giving you the access when I have privileged communications [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=229.96s)]
*  on my cell phone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=234.48s)]
*  Well, that charged, you know, put him in a position [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=235.68s)]
*  where he had to go speak to a supervisor. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=237.72s)]
*  He comes back several minutes later and says, why don't you write down, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  he gave me a legal pad, why don't you write down what it is that you feel [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=242.96s)]
*  is privileged, and we won't go through that stuff. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=246.48s)]
*  We'll go through everything else. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=249.04s)]
*  I said, what kind of a futile exercise would that be? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=250.6s)]
*  I've got to go through nearly 15 years of communications and emails and files [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=253.48s)]
*  to say, this is privileged and this isn't? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=258.68s)]
*  I said, that's ridiculous. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=261.24s)]
*  It's an impossibility to go through all that stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=262.4s)]
*  So we came after, I mean, this is going on for nearly an hour and a half. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=264.68s)]
*  We came to the final pass. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=269.0s)]
*  He said, listen, again, if you want to leave here with your phone, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=270.4s)]
*  you're going to have to give us access. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  And so they asked me, why don't you just show us the context in your phone? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=275.92s)]
*  They wanted to know who my contacts were. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  They wanted to do a data dump of all the contacts in my phone. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=282.52s)]
*  And I said, well, and he said, do you believe that that's privileged information? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  I said, it very well could be, but I don't want you to take my phone away from me [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=290.12s)]
*  either. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  So I agreed to let them see my contacts only. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=294.56s)]
*  And so once they did that, they came back and wanted to question, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=297.88s)]
*  they gave me a list about five or six names of contacts that were on my phone [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  and wanted to know how it was associated with these folks, what's my relationship [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=305.44s)]
*  to them, where did I meet them, how did I know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  And I said, now you're getting too far. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=311.8s)]
*  Everybody that's in my phone is either going to be a family member, a friend, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=314.0s)]
*  or a client. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=317.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=318.12s)]
*  And that's all the information I'm going to give you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=318.76s)]
*  And to me, let me just for one second, one, did they say who they were? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=320.72s)]
*  Was it Customs and Border Patrol? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=327.44s)]
*  Did they say who they were? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  And did they give you a top line up the front who said, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=330.68s)]
*  we've pulled you aside because of X? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=333.16s)]
*  Well, they wouldn't tell me why they stopped me. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=338.2s)]
*  They did tell me, and they were prepared. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=340.24s)]
*  So it wasn't random. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=342.8s)]
*  This is not something where I was just randomly selected. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  They knew who I was. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=346.44s)]
*  They knew my history. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=347.44s)]
*  They knew I had represented high profile cases. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=348.48s)]
*  They told me we looked you up, and they were ready to ask me pointed questions [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  about certain things. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=355.48s)]
*  And because he brought up the high profile case, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=357.2s)]
*  it led me to believe that they're targeting me specifically because I've [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=359.92s)]
*  taken up the defense for this young lady, Miss Samantha Lewis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=364.16s)]
*  And to me, I was really appalled by that apparent overreach [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=367.6s)]
*  of the government at this point. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=372.88s)]
*  And they were Customs and Border Protection agents just wearing plain clothes. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  He showed me a badge, but he wouldn't tell me his name. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=378.24s)]
*  And I mean, we should be clear here that the normal sort of protocol of rights [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  are different at the border, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  They can sort of ask anyone anything they want, essentially, at the border. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=392.72s)]
*  Had you ever had an interaction like this before where you had, A, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  were questioned, but ever had anyone in law enforcement mention your clients [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=402.16s)]
*  as the possible motive? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=406.92s)]
*  I've never been interviewed at the border. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=411.04s)]
*  I've gone and traveled, and they knew that I've traveled extensively [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  outside of the country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=416.24s)]
*  And I just, as of recent as December, on Christmas break, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=418.04s)]
*  we took another family trip to Mexico. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  I came back, and nobody stopped us. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=423.0s)]
*  But that was not during the Trump administration. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=424.72s)]
*  This is the distinction in this situation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=427.04s)]
*  We now have a new administration who's made it very clear that they're going to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=429.16s)]
*  attack attorneys who are taking on cases that are against the interests of what [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=433.24s)]
*  this current administration believes in. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  We've seen the memos that they've put out for immigration attorneys, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  and I'm not a practicing immigration lawyer, but it's disturbing that they want [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=445.68s)]
*  to sanction immigration attorneys for cases that they would deem to be frivolous [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=449.64000000000004s)]
*  if they're helping people who are seeking asylum or attacking those DC law firms [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  in the executive orders. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=459.56s)]
*  So we're seeing a chilling effect on not just individuals and their rights, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  but also on the attorneys representing these individuals. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=466.44s)]
*  Yeah, and I just want to be clear here. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  DHS has not offered any rationale here, so they've been a black box in terms [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=470.68s)]
*  of what was going on. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=475.8s)]
*  They might come out publicly with some other account of why this happened that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  wasn't about who you're representing, but your account suggests at least that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=482.04s)]
*  that was someone in front of mine, Amir Maklad, who's an attorney in Detroit who [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=486.04s)]
*  was questioned at length in part about the clients he represents, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=490.16s)]
*  an American citizen. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=495.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time tonight, sir. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=496.48s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=497.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=500.16s)]
