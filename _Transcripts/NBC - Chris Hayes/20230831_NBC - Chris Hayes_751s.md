# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 30
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today we finally got some semblance of accountability for one of the darkest chapters of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's attempted coup. A district judge has found today [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=7.08s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani liable for defaming two Georgia election workers as part of his effort to spread Donald Trump's big lie of a stolen [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=11.02s)]
*  2020 election. The disgraced former mayor will now go on civil trial to determine how much he must pay in damages [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=19.2s)]
*  to Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shay Moss over statements like this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=26.52s)]
*  which Giuliani has already admitted in court proceedings were false and defamatory. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=31.48s)]
*  Look at it taking those ballots out. Look at them scurrying around with the ballots. Nobody in the room hiding around. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=37.96s)]
*  They look like they're passing out dope, not just ballots. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=43.44s)]
*  It is quite clear they're stealing votes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=48.56s)]
*  It's a tape earlier in the day of Ruby Freeman and Shay Freeman Moss and one other gentleman [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=50.84s)]
*  quite obviously surreptitiously passing around [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=56.88s)]
*  USB ports as if they're vials of heroin or cocaine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  That was a transparently racist lie. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=64.64s)]
*  Obvious and despicable at the time. Ruby Freeman and Shay Moss did absolutely nothing wrong. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=68.68s)]
*  In fact, they were just two women who wanted to contribute their efforts and labor to the maintenance of American democracy and to dispatch [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=73.88s)]
*  their duty with diligence and patriotism. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=80.72s)]
*  They initially became the target of these conspiracies when a far-right website published blatant lies about the two women [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=83.4s)]
*  committing widespread voter fraud in Georgia. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=90.44s)]
*  That initiated a kind of feedback loop that then made its way to both Giuliani and Donald Trump who decided to make these two black [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=93.0s)]
*  women the center of their deranged voter fraud conspiracy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=100.32s)]
*  Again and again, both in public and in private, the two men lied, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=104.92s)]
*  claiming these two election workers. Again, two women who are doing the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=109.84s)]
*  glamourless work of making sure an election works, right? Counting votes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=114.68s)]
*  But these two women had somehow stolen tens of thousands of votes in the state of Georgia. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  On that infamous call with Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, the ex-president who's now been indicted for it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=123.72s)]
*  mentioned Ruby Freeman by name [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=131.76s)]
*  nearly 20 times. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=134.88s)]
*  18,000 voters [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=137.56s)]
*  having to do with Ruby Freeman. She's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=139.72s)]
*  hustler. Ruby Freeman. The minimum number is 18,000 for Ruby, but they think it's probably about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=146.68s)]
*  56,000. But the minimum number is 18,000 on the Ruby Freeman night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=154.04s)]
*  stuffed. She stuffed the ballot boxes. Let's face it, Brad. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=161.12s)]
*  Can I just say something about that section, which just to take a second here? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=163.96s)]
*  The votes at that point had been counted three times. I think they've been counted and recounted and hand recounted. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=168.68s)]
*  So think about how [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=174.6s)]
*  blatantly ludicrous, I mean past what even Donald Trump could believe, that one woman had just like [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=177.12s)]
*  stolen 56,000 votes on a USB and no one had just figured it out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=183.24s)]
*  Like it's not a delusion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=187.84s)]
*  That's past delusion, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=190.56s)]
*  And after they became the target of this harassment campaign from the most powerful man on earth, Ruby Freeman and Shay Moss had their lives [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=194.12s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=201.84s)]
*  Destroyed. As Moss told the January 6th committee last summer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=203.28s)]
*  This turned my life upside down. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=208.4s)]
*  I no longer give out my business card. I don't transfer calls. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=216.04s)]
*  I don't want anyone knowing my name. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=223.88s)]
*  I don't want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=226.32s)]
*  I don't go to the grocery store at all. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=231.6s)]
*  I haven't been anywhere [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=234.92s)]
*  at all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=238.16s)]
*  Additionally, Ruby Freeman was forced to call 911 [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=240.16s)]
*  multiple times in the weeks after the election over messages containing racial slurs and even death threats telling one dispatcher, quote, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=243.28s)]
*  They're saying stuff like we're coming to get you. We are coming to get you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=249.44s)]
*  On at least two occasions, strangers showed up at Freeman's door in the middle of the night. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=254.12s)]
*  And then, well then came Kanye's former publicist. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=261.0s)]
*  On January 4th, 2021, a woman named Trevian Kuti showed up at Ruby Freeman's door offering to help her and a terrified Freeman, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=264.68s)]
*  who had been facing threats for a month now, agreed to meet with Kuti at a local police station. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=272.92s)]
*  And that's when Trevian Kuti, working in conjunction with a man named Harrison Floyd, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=277.68s)]
*  apparently tried to threaten Freeman into falsely admitting that she did in fact rig the election for Biden. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  You are a loose end for a party that needs to tie me up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=307.6s)]
*  You are a loose end for a party that needs to tie me up. What on earth? What a nightmare. What a nightmare. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  That woman Trevian Kuti, along with Harrison Floyd, have also both been indicted in the Georgia Rico case. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=322.12s)]
*  You can see them there in their mugshots. And of course, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=327.72s)]
*  so too has Rudy Giuliani. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=331.24s)]
*  We last saw last week when he was spotted at a second chance bail box in Atlanta. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=333.32s)]
*  But the coup lawyer's legal headaches don't end there. According to a new report in Rolling Stone, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=339.08s)]
*  Special Counsel Jack Smith is reportedly probing Rudy Giuliani's apparent drinking problem. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=343.24s)]
*  Specifically, Smith's investigators want to know, quote, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=349.36s)]
*  whether Donald Trump was knowingly relying on an inebriated attorney while trying to overturn a presidential election. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=352.08s)]
*  Giuliani is also facing a lawsuit from a former employee who is accusing him of some truly vile behavior, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  which I'm not going to repeat here, including graphic allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=364.08s)]
*  tirades containing homophobic slurs and anti-Semitic comments, allegations we should note that Giuliani denies. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=369.24s)]
*  Of course, we do not know how many of those cases will play out. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=376.88s)]
*  But at the very least, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss have some accountability today. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=380.12s)]
*  What Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump and the rest of them, what they did to these women was one of the most disgusting aspects of this entire episode. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  And now he's going to have to pay for it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=393.44s)]
*  Trump and his confederates act like no one will ever hold them accountable. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  That's how they acted through much of the administration. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=401.24s)]
*  It's how they acted after the 2020 election, where they tried to destroy these women's lives as part of a headlong run at ending American democracy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=403.2s)]
*  It is how they are acting now in many respects. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  And the only thing that will change their behavior is to do the thing they don't think will happen. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=412.96s)]
*  Hold them accountable. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=419.24s)]
*  And not just once. They have to be shown over and over and over and over again. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=420.88s)]
*  They cannot just get away with everything the way they have most of their lives. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=426.24s)]
*  And while Giuliani losing a civil defamation case is not the same thing as facing years in prison in Georgia or a potential federal indictment down the line, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=432.88s)]
*  it is a kind of down payment on actual accountability. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=440.52s)]
*  So there is some measure of justice today. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=445.4s)]
*  As Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss said in a statement today, the fight to rebuild our reputations and to repair the damage to our lives is not over. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=448.6s)]
*  But today we're one step closer. And for that, we are grateful. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=455.6s)]
*  You don't have to be a climate scientist to understand what's happening. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=460.68s)]
*  The basic mechanics here are incredibly simple, incredibly straightforward. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  As we burn fossil fuels, we pump more and more carbon into the atmosphere. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  The carbon causes atmosphere to trap more heat from the sun, warming the planet and warming the oceans. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=474.0s)]
*  Those warmer oceans hold more energy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=479.79999999999995s)]
*  There's more energy in there. And that energy fuels storms that get stronger faster. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=482.35999999999996s)]
*  In fact, the extra heat increases the likelihood and severity of all kinds of extreme weather events in all kinds of places. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, before all this, hundreds of years ago, the pre-industrial age, Florida was already uniquely exposed to extreme weather. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=493.72s)]
*  It is a peninsula jutting out into warm waters directly in the path of hurricanes that form every year. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=502.72s)]
*  Now, as the threat of severe weather increases, so of course, there's a threat of harm to this beautiful place that millions of people call home. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=508.72s)]
*  In the extreme weather aside, Florida is a lovely place to be. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=516.72s)]
*  Not only that, it's a marvel of human engineering. I mean, truly. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=520.32s)]
*  150 years ago, much of Florida was an uninhabitable pestilential swamp. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=523.32s)]
*  We drained and developed millions of acres, turned Florida into literally Disney World. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=528.32s)]
*  A great civilizational achievement, man over nature. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=533.32s)]
*  It is right now at a great risk of being undone by the greatest civilizational threat we have ever faced. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=537.32s)]
*  Given all of that, you would think that the people who represent that uniquely precarious slice of land jutting out into the ocean in the path of increasingly severe storms [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  would be fervently trying to mitigate the risk, reduce the enormous amounts of energy we are pumping into the atmosphere. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  But the reality is literally the opposite. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  Florida's Republican leaders are actually trying to make it worse actively. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis is refusing to accept $350 million in energy efficiency incentives that Florida is eligible for under the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=572.52s)]
*  He's just saying, burn it, no thanks, to hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=581.52s)]
*  And this is not like for some weird experimental, like liberal cause. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=585.52s)]
*  It would just help people retrofit their homes with energy efficient appliances, which is a very simple, straightforward way to help tackle carbon emissions and climate change. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=590.52s)]
*  The rejection is just insane nihilism. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=600.12s)]
*  On one level, it's hard to even believe it, that he's doing this. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=602.12s)]
*  But of course, you know, Ron DeSantis also turned against the code vaccines, which is an equally obvious benefit for his constituents. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=605.12s)]
*  My God, it is so rare in life and in policy that you just are handed something so simple that provides so much benefit, like the vaccines. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=612.12s)]
*  And Ron DeSantis just turned on it for political expedience. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=621.12s)]
*  I mean, his position on climate change is essentially vaccine denialism at civilizational scale. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=625.72s)]
*  To Ron DeSantis, this existential threat to the peninsula he represents is just another political debate. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=631.72s)]
*  What I found is people, when they start talking about things like global warming, they typically use that as a pretext to do a bunch of left wing things that they would want to do anyways. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=638.72s)]
*  And so we're not doing any left wing stuff. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbp_toXS14&t=648.72s)]
