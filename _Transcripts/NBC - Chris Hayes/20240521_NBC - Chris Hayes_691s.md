# ‘Backfired’: Trump witness’s own emails used against him on cross-examination
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, after five weeks, the first criminal trial of a former US president is nearly over. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=0.0s)]
*  The defense rested this morning. It called only two witnesses. And despite all his bravo and insistences to the contrary, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=7.5s)]
*  yeah, Donald Trump was not one of them. I mean, we knew that, right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=15.5s)]
*  Instead, we heard briefly from a paralegal at attorney Todd Blanchett's firm about phone records [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=20.5s)]
*  before a man by the name of Robert Costello took the stand. Now, Costello is a former federal prosecutor, a very close associate of Rudy Giuliani, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=26.5s)]
*  the twice indicted former mayor of New York City. We'll have more about him later in the show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=36.5s)]
*  And also Donald Trump's personal attorney while he's in the White House, Giuliani, that is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=40.5s)]
*  I think it is fair to say that Costello's testimony this week backfired on the defense, though how much remains to be determined. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=45.5s)]
*  But Trump's attorney's main reason to put that man, Robert Costello, on the stand was to directly contradict and impugn the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, Michael Cohen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=52.5s)]
*  But I got to say, it turns out Robert Costello might be the only person in the country who can make Michael Cohen seem even tempered by comparison. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=63.5s)]
*  Costello began his testimony yesterday acting like what can be best described as a petulant teenager, rolling his eyes, muttering under his breath. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=72.5s)]
*  At one point saying that something would be to strike something. Of course, that's not his job. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=80.5s)]
*  That's the judge. And then after sort of crossing the judge, like tried to stare him down, at which point the judge was like, are you staring me down? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=85.5s)]
*  And cleared the courtroom. After clearing the courtroom, the judge called Costello's conduct, quote, contemptuous in the sort of like technical, narrow sense of contempt of court. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=93.5s)]
*  And threatened to remove him from the stand and strike his testimony for the record. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=105.5s)]
*  That man, Costello, again, the big star witness for the defense, right, the one person they're putting up, returned to the stand today for cross examination. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=109.5s)]
*  Now, remember, at the center of Costello's testimony is a 2018 meeting he had with Cohen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=118.5s)]
*  That's after Cohen had been issued a search warrant or had a search warrant executed by the FBI. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=123.5s)]
*  And as Cohen tells it, he's having these back and forth with Costello, who's putting a very kind of high pressure sales job on him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=129.5s)]
*  The implication of which was that they had to kind of keep Cohen in Trump's circle to prevent him from flipping that, you know, Costello was aligned with Rudy, who was aligned with Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=137.5s)]
*  So hire me. You'll stay in the circle. Now, Costello says he was just there to offer his legal services. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=148.5s)]
*  So that's the sort of main battle here, right, over over what happened. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=153.5s)]
*  And today, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Costello, quote, you discussed with Cohen at that very first meeting how connected you were to Rudy Giuliani, correct? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=158.5s)]
*  And Costello responded, quote, that's not true. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=166.5s)]
*  Hoffinger then read Costello an email Costello wrote to Cohen two days after that meeting, which stated, and we quote here, I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=169.5s)]
*  I told you that my relationship with Rudy could be very, very useful to you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=180.5s)]
*  Again, Costello's words. The prosecutor also read an email he wrote to a legal partner the same day, not to Cohen, quote, all the more reason for Cohen to hire me because of my connection to Giuliani, which I mentioned to him in our meeting. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=184.5s)]
*  So, again, you mentioned Giuliani the first meeting. No, under oath. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=198.5s)]
*  Well, let me read two emails here in which you're like, I mentioned Giuliani. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=203.5s)]
*  Okay, in further communications, it's clear that Costello continued to dangle his relationship with Giuliani and again by extension Donald Trump over Cohen's head in another email from Costello to Cohen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=207.5s)]
*  He wrote, quote, I spoke with Rudy very, very positive. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=218.5s)]
*  You are loved, which I will say is sweet, adding, quote, there was never a doubt that they are in our corner. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=221.5s)]
*  Rudy says this communication channel must be maintained and, quote, sleep well tonight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=227.5s)]
*  You have friends in high places. Also sweet. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=232.5s)]
*  P.S. Some very positive comments about you from the White House. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=234.5s)]
*  Now you may be thinking that the invocation of Giuliani and Trump repeatedly in written communications by this man doesn't definitively prove Costello's intentions. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=238.5s)]
*  But in a stunning example of something you really don't want to put in writing, prosecutors then today read another email again from Costello to that same legal partner, quote, I'm quoting again. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=247.5s)]
*  Our issue is to get Cohen on the right page without giving him the appearance. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=256.5s)]
*  We are following instructions from Giuliani or the president. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=261.5s)]
*  And I got to say, when you put it like that, it sure sounds like he was following instructions from Giuliani and the president, doesn't it? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=264.5s)]
*  So the defense's final act, their one big witness did not, I think, do a great job exonerating their client or even sort of knocking down the credibility of the man that he was supposed to knock down Michael Cohen. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=272.5s)]
*  I have to say, I follow this trial very closely, not as closely as some of our next guests who have been in the courtroom every day. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=283.5s)]
*  But excuse me, I find Michael Cohen on the core matters of fact that are relevant to the charges believable. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=288.5s)]
*  That's in large part due to the extensive documentation provided by all kinds of people, including Robert Costello himself, not to mention the lengthy paper trail outlining each step of the scheme to repaint Cohen for the hush money he paid to Stormy Daniels [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=298.5s)]
*  to cover up the sexual encounter she had with Donald Trump. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=312.5s)]
*  The attempts to hide those reimbursements in the form of bogus legal payments. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=315.5s)]
*  The basic contours of that, like, was Stormy Daniels paid? Did Cohen paid for it? Was he reimbursed? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=319.5s)]
*  All of that's not really in dispute. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=326.5s)]
*  A week from now, when closing arguments start, this will all be in the hands of the jury, and they're going to ultimately decide the ex-president's fate. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=328.5s)]
*  Joining me now are two people inside the courthouse today. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=336.5s)]
*  MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin and New York Times investigative reporter Suzanne Craig. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=339.5s)]
*  It's great to have you both here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=344.5s)]
*  So I missed the Costello fireworks yesterday. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=345.5s)]
*  Jen Psaki had her show on Mondays. I don't have one on Mondays. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=347.5s)]
*  I was following it. I was even texting with Lisa being like, is this as insane as it sounds? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=350.5s)]
*  So let me just go back a day because I wasn't there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=354.5s)]
*  Like, the Costello experience in that courtroom. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=357.5s)]
*  Well, you're not going to sell me out by reading my response. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=360.5s)]
*  My response was beyond. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=362.5s)]
*  The Costello experience in the courtroom is a really good instructive lesson on how demeanor matters because you can say all sorts of things about your misdeeds. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=365.5s)]
*  And so long as you remain polite and contrite and succinct, jurors might believe you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=375.5s)]
*  And Michael Cohen is an illustration of that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=382.5s)]
*  What was so bizarre is that the Robert Costello that we saw over the last couple of days reminded me of the Michael Cohen that we saw at the civil fraud trial. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=384.5s)]
*  Which was exactly the fear of everyone around the prosecutor's office for this trial. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=392.5s)]
*  Even to the point that in the same way that Costello said, strike that or the email speaks for itself, which is also something lawyers say in defense of clients, for example. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=397.5s)]
*  Michael Cohen at that civil fraud trial would say from the witness stand, asked and answered. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=408.5s)]
*  Right. Very bombastically. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=413.5s)]
*  So the role reversal was very telling. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=415.5s)]
*  But I want to read you, Chris, another email that came out with Robert Costello today toward the end because it is maybe the worst example of how Costello was just seeking to advance Donald Trump's interests and not Michael Cohen's as he swore. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=417.5s)]
*  At one point he writes to his partner, Jeff Citron, who is the person who had a relationship with Cohen and says, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=431.5s)]
*  And who introduced the two men. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=436.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=437.5s)]
*  And says, tune into CNN and see how they are playing this up. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=438.5s)]
*  Cohen has to know this, yet he continues to slow play us and the president. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=441.5s)]
*  Is he totally nuts? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=446.5s)]
*  What should I say to this blank hole? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=448.5s)]
*  He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=451.5s)]
*  And by that Costello, despite his high opinion of himself, didn't mean him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=455.5s)]
*  Right. He met Donald Trump. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=459.5s)]
*  Right. Can we just put that we have that full screen. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=461.5s)]
*  What should I say to this blank hole? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=463.5s)]
*  He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet, which is like, right. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=465.5s)]
*  So the story Cohen is telling is you are Donald Trump's dude and you're there to get me. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=468.5s)]
*  And then he's writing this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=474.5s)]
*  Did you what did you think of the cross of Costello? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=476.5s)]
*  Well, I just first want to give some props to the sketch artist who was in court who caught that moment. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=479.5s)]
*  We just had it up. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=485.5s)]
*  The stare down. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=486.5s)]
*  Yeah, the stare down where the judge is like, whoa. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=487.5s)]
*  Right there. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=489.5s)]
*  It's good. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=491.5s)]
*  Yeah. You're right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=492.5s)]
*  You don't often see. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=493.5s)]
*  Jane Rosenberg. Shout out Jane Rosenberg. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=494.5s)]
*  Shout out. Definitely. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=496.5s)]
*  So what did I think of the cross examination today when when the government got back up? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=497.5s)]
*  I thought it was incredible. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=503.5s)]
*  I mean, just how she dissected him in the amount of time and just got right to those emails and just I think laid bare that he was an agent of Giuliani and Donald Trump. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=505.5s)]
*  And no wonder Michael Cohen, you know, the whole the whole premise of having Costello up there was to discredit Cohen. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=516.5s)]
*  Because he because Costello could come and say, well, he never admitted that he made these payments to me. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=523.5s)]
*  And Michael Cohen said I was really suspicious of this guy. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=528.5s)]
*  Well, no wonder. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=531.5s)]
*  No wonder. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=533.5s)]
*  I was going to say no, something Sherlock. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=534.5s)]
*  Yeah. And we should say there's one piece of testimony Costello gives that is that where he says Cohen told him I don't have anything on the president. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=536.5s)]
*  And in some ways, you know, that's relevant. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=543.5s)]
*  And I can see the defense. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=546.5s)]
*  You want to get that in. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=547.5s)]
*  Again, like, look, we talked to this guy and he he was like, I got nothing. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=548.5s)]
*  So you want to plant the seeds that he invented it later. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=551.5s)]
*  Right. Expose facto. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=554.5s)]
*  But given the broader contours, there's two stories here about this interaction and the Cohen story again, to my mind, from the testimony I saw in that room when I was there and from the emails like the Cohen story seems to match the other evidence much better than the Costello story does. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=555.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=572.5s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=573.5s)]
*  That's absolutely correct. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=574.5s)]
*  And then we have another problem with Bob Costello story. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=575.5s)]
*  In order to credit Bob Costello story that Michael Cohen eventually lied, you have to believe that he was telling the truth to Costello at some point in time, which means Michael Cohen tells the truth at some points in time. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=577.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=588.5s)]
*  So it's sort of facially ridiculous at some point for Bob Costello to be Michael Cohen's a liar because his entire testimony is premised on Michael Cohen telling him the truth for some period of time. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=589.5s)]
*  And that's going to come, you know, Michael Cohen, he's a liar. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=600.5s)]
*  He's a cheat. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=603.5s)]
*  But this case is going to come down to the jury believing at least at some point he can tell the truth. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=604.5s)]
*  It's not binary. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=610.5s)]
*  It's not like he always lies. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=611.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=613.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=614.5s)]
*  They have to believe him on certain points. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=615.5s)]
*  And those are going to be points that the government is going to say that they have cooperation for. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=616.5s)]
*  Either they have interviews or interviews, or they have conversations to cooperate or they have documents because Michael Cohen is the only person who can speak to the criminal law. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=620.5s)]
*  He can speak to the criminal disguise of the documents. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=629.5s)]
*  He was at all the key meetings. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=631.5s)]
*  He is the through line. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=632.5s)]
*  There has to be some believability on those meetings that he has spoken to. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=633.5s)]
*  We have that incredible Allen Weisselberg, the gross up document where everything sort of cooked and here's how the payments are going to work. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=637.5s)]
*  And then Allen Weisselberg and Michael Cohen then go to speak to Donald Trump about it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=646.5s)]
*  We have not heard from Allen Weisselberg. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=653.5s)]
*  He's over at Rikers. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=655.5s)]
*  He has not been called. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=656.5s)]
*  So we've got Michael Cohen's word on that conversation with Donald Trump where he signed off on it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=657.5s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=663.5s)]
*  And they just have to believe him on stuff where there's actually evidence. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=664.5s)]
*  We just put it up on the screen. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=667.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=668.5s)]
*  But that may have happened. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=669.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmtiSFO1I4&t=687.5s)]
