# 'Sigh of frustration': Trump Jan. 6 trial delayed pending immunity appeal
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM)
*  We also have some breaking news tonight on the many legal cases facing Donald Trump. Judge Tonya [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=0.0s)]
*  Chutkin just formally canceled Trump's election interference trial that had been scheduled for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=4.64s)]
*  March 4th, writing that, quote, the court will set a new schedule if and when the mandate is returned. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=10.08s)]
*  The mandate, of course, is the long awaited decision by the appellate court on the ex-president's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  claim of absolute immunity from prosecution. Until that ruling, which we're still waiting for, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=20.96s)]
*  we won't know when or if the D.C. trial, arguably the most important trial in recent American [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=27.12s)]
*  history and certainly of the four criminal cases against Trump, will happen. Just the kind of delay [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=33.52s)]
*  he wants. Joining me now, Harry Lippman, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Department [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=38.96s)]
*  of Justice. Let's just start with this. I mean, I think this is just acknowledging what everyone knew [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=43.04s)]
*  to be true and is essentially just a kind of administrative move, though it highlights the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=47.92s)]
*  fact that it's now been three or four weeks, I think, and we still don't have anything from [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=52.72s)]
*  the D.C. Circuit. Yeah, 24 days. And yes, it's administrative. The mandate is what one needs for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  jurisdiction. So in that sense, she says it's not my case anymore. But that if and when sort of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=64.0s)]
*  wafts off the page, you can almost hear a sigh of frustration with it. D.C. Circuit, is there an if [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=71.92s)]
*  here? Will I ever see it again? So, you know, yes, a kind of checking of a box, but a little bit [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=78.88s)]
*  almost frustrated and poignant. Yeah, I got that too. I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm reading into [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=86.56s)]
*  it, but I thought the if and when was striking. Let's talk about. You didn't need the if. Yeah, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=91.92s)]
*  that's right. She didn't have to. So let's talk about two other cases here. So one is the there's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  another thing we're waiting for, which is the ruling by Judge Ingoran in New York State Court [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=105.44s)]
*  where there's a civil fraud trial. And we have a development there, which is that the former [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=111.6s)]
*  finance chief, Alan Weisselberg, is in negotiations to plead guilty to perjury for testimony during [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=116.72s)]
*  this civil fraud trial. As part of the agreement, he would have to admit he'd lied on the witness [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=124.0s)]
*  stand in the recent civil fraud trial. It would likely not require to turn on his former boss. The [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=128.48s)]
*  potential agreement could strengthen Bragg's hand before the former president's trial could deter [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=133.6s)]
*  other witnesses in Mr. Trump's circle from lying on the stand. What do you make of this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=137.92s)]
*  You know, he's become the human pinata for Donald Trump, like the ultimate whatever Trump touches [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=143.04s)]
*  dies, right? There's a poignancy to it. And he's just he just sits there and takes it because he [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=149.12s)]
*  and he doesn't want to cooperate. It's a pretty interesting. I think the perjury risk going to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=154.56s)]
*  concern his testimony that he didn't really care about the 10000 versus 30000 foot discrepancy [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=159.04s)]
*  in the apartment. But it's clear that he that he did. Now, that's that's not part of the of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=166.4s)]
*  case that was it's now being pursued. But prosecutors don't like perjury very much. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=172.56s)]
*  And, you know, they came after him. But just what a completely defeated shell of a man, 76 years old [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  and just standing there and having to take it for his lifelong loyalty to to Fred Trump and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=186.8s)]
*  Donald Trump. Yeah, he's you know, he's the ultimate kind of roadkill here. Yes, that's a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=195.52s)]
*  great point. And also, I'm sorry, one more thing, because of Angoren Angoren said the 31st and, you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=200.56s)]
*  know, that two weeks later, that's that's a long time. So I think one can surmise that both this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=206.24s)]
*  fact and he doesn't know any more than we do. They don't tell him in the D.A.'s office, but that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=212.88s)]
*  Weisselberg may plead guilty. And also the report we got from Judge Jones, which set out all these [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=219.84s)]
*  ongoing problems, those may well figure in Angoren's calculation of penalty need for for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=225.68s)]
*  certain protections and the like. So I think that's the most likely explanation for why we're [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=233.12s)]
*  going two more weeks. OK, finally here on the Georgia case, of course, allegations of impropriety [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=238.48s)]
*  leveraged in both the press and also in a court filing against District Attorney Funny Willis for [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=244.56s)]
*  what what the opposing counsel had contended was an improper relationship with Nathan Wade, who's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  an attorney who's been an outside attorney brought into the office. Her filing today, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=256.56s)]
*  basically, top line is yes, they have had a relationship. No, it is an improper, doesn't [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=261.28s)]
*  rise to any level of anything that should affect her involvement in the case. What do you think of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=268.0s)]
*  her filing? It's 100 percent true under Georgia law. She needed to do it. You know, the law of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=273.36s)]
*  these kinds of scandals is get it all out early. The thing is, by now there's sort of blood in the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=279.76s)]
*  water. You have one of these, you know, phony baloney special investigative commissions in Georgia, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=284.8s)]
*  no other than Jim Jordan subpoenaed her today. McAfee is going to have a hearing on the 15th, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  and oddly, even before this, he started an evidentiary hearing. So what sort of evidence [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  is it going to take? That could be a bit of a circus, and this could continue, even though [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=304.0s)]
*  it should be the end of it. There's no conflict here. OK, Harry Libman, thank you very much. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcPP0gCC0mM&t=320.72s)]
