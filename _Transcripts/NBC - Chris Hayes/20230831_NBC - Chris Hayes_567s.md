Video Description: Chris Hayes on Georgia Gov. Kemp opposing calls to oust Fulton County DA Fani Willis: "Kemp and Raffensberger are in this unique position: they don't have anything to fear politically from Trump. The implicit threat—that he controls his base, his followers will defeat you in a primary challenge if you don't do his bidding—didn't work."

# 'Political theater:' Gov. Kemp shuts down GOP calls to oust Fani Willis
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The frontrunner for the Republican presidential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=0.0s)]
*  nomination is facing an existential threat to his personal freedom and his explicit goal [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  and the goal of the party he commands is to keep him out of prison, end to end American [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=9.48s)]
*  democracy as we know it. But today we saw another demonstration that there are limits [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=13.32s)]
*  to just how far he can bully Republicans into doing his bidding. In the last 24 hours or [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  posted video after video issuing orders for vengeance and authoritarian retribution. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=25.0s)]
*  America is becoming a banana republic. My whole life I never got indicted or even thought about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=32.12s)]
*  it and now they're indicting me every chance they get. They're trying to steal the election [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=37.16s)]
*  by interfering with the campaign and we are not going to let that happen. Great American patriots [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=42.04s)]
*  see what is happening to our country and they're not going to allow it to continue to happen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=49.08s)]
*  To the Democrats I say be careful what you wish for. We will expose their corruption for history [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=54.76s)]
*  to see and justice will be done so keep on fighting. I hope that Republican district [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=61.32s)]
*  attorneys and attorney generals throughout the country are closely watching the tremendous [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=67.0s)]
*  weaponization of justice that is being utilized against me. Frankly it's an eye for an eye or it's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=72.44s)]
*  fight fire with fire. To be clear those are all different videos that wasn't just one long video [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=79.96s)]
*  like he's just sitting in front of the camera and then like just ranting and then they stop [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=86.44s)]
*  and they rants again and they stop and they post it and he seems to be almost single-mindedly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  focused as you can see on the idea of retribution. In an interview with Glenn Beck earlier this week [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=95.16s)]
*  he pledged to lock up his political opponents if elected president. You said in in 2016 you know [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=99.8s)]
*  lock her up and then when you became president you said we don't do that in America that's just not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=107.16s)]
*  the right thing to do. That's what they're doing. Do you regret not locking her up and if you're [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=111.08s)]
*  president again will you lock people up? Well I'll give you an example. The answer is you have no [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=116.52s)]
*  choice because they're doing it to us. On social media he is barking orders at House Republicans to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=123.56s)]
*  impeach President Biden writing quote either impeach the bum or fade into oblivion they did [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=129.88s)]
*  it to us. He also recently called for the impeachment of Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=134.36s)]
*  of course indicted him and 18 of his confederates earlier this month. As I have said again and again [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=139.48s)]
*  one of the ways that MAGA operates is by cultivating an atmosphere of menace and threat [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=146.04s)]
*  of physical violence as approximate possibility. Trump signals to his followers that intimidation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=152.04s)]
*  and retribution are just inevitable tools in our civil society. Don't look at me people are angry [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=158.2s)]
*  and he tries to give himself the trappings of plausible deniability. It's very clear what he's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  doing and that his people are listening but maybe he doesn't command the fear and obedience of all [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  Republicans like he think he does. In Georgia Republican legislators recently passed a law [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=176.44s)]
*  giving them the ability to do what Trump told them to. This is before even Fonny Willis indicted and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=182.12s)]
*  it is the ability to remove any DA but specifically in this case Fonny Willis from her position as the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=187.56s)]
*  Fulton County DA so that Trump could effectively walk on the charges. Earlier this week one Georgia [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=193.48s)]
*  State Center told Steve Bannon that removing Willis using this newly passed law by the Republicans in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=200.44s)]
*  the state was the only alternative to get this a full-blown civil war to stop Trump's indictments. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=205.88s)]
*  Now that we've got 19 people who are facing the rest of their life in prison because they spoke [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=215.0s)]
*  out against an election I mean you know I told one senator I said listen I said we've got to put our [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=219.16s)]
*  heads together and figure this out we need to be taking action right now because if we don't our [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=226.12s)]
*  constituencies are going to be fighting it in the streets. Do you want a civil war? I don't want a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=231.4s)]
*  civil war. I don't want to have to draw my rifle. I want to make this problem go away with my [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=237.08s)]
*  legislative means of doing so and the first step to getting that done is defunding Fonny Willis. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=243.72s)]
*  I don't want violence. I hate violence. I'd hate to take my gun out and have to shoot someone in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=251.08s)]
*  the head with it. I don't want to do that. I don't want you to be shot by all these people that might [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=256.04s)]
*  take their guns and shoot you their political enemies. That's not what I want to do. Do you [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=260.28s)]
*  understand? What do you think Donald Trump did in response to that video? He posted another video, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  same position, praising the guy talking about a civil war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=271.79999999999995s)]
*  Highly respected Georgia State Senator Colton Moore deserves thanks and congratulations of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=276.2s)]
*  everyone for having the courage and conviction to fight the radical left lunatics who are so [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=282.11999999999995s)]
*  badly hurting the great state of Georgia and frankly the USA itself. Now as we've been following [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=288.12s)]
*  this in our coverage, it's been a kind of open question, right? Georgia Republicans passed this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=295.48s)]
*  law, gave them the power to remove district attorneys. Would they use it to go along with [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=300.92s)]
*  the scheme to remove D.A. Willis? But there's also, as much as Trump wants them to, and obviously [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=305.32s)]
*  there's noise about it, there's also this other factor, which there's something different about [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=311.32s)]
*  the upper echelon of Georgia Republican officials. And it's not that they're necessarily different [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=315.4s)]
*  in principle or character. What is different is that they very much understand that they [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=320.84s)]
*  represent an emerging purple state. They understand that Donald Trump is a political albatross around [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=325.96s)]
*  their necks who just in a cold calculating sense hurts their chances of winning majorities among [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  swing voters. They have seen this brute fact in action over and over and over again. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=339.16s)]
*  In the state of Georgia where there's currently a hand recount being done, Joe Biden is the apparent [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  winner. Again, Joe Biden, the apparent winner in Georgia. NBC News now projects Raphael Warnock [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  as the winner in the special Georgia Senate election tonight. NBC News now projecting that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  John Ossoff, the Democrat, will win the Senate runoff in the state of Georgia. And that leads [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=368.44s)]
*  to the projection that Democrats will regain control of the U.S. Senate. NBC News can now [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=375.4s)]
*  project that the winner of the Georgia U.S. Senate election tonight is incumbent Democrat Raphael [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=381.08s)]
*  Warnock. And after these Georgia Republicans like Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=387.56s)]
*  Raffensperger refused to help Donald Trump pull off his coup in 2020, he did what he always does, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=393.24s)]
*  right? The same thing we saw him braying about in those videos. He vowed vengeance and retribution. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=398.76s)]
*  And in this case, he did it by endorsing primary challengers to both men. Former Georgia Senator [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=404.44s)]
*  David Perdue, the one who lost in 2020, in no small part because of Trump, he ran against incumbent [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=409.56s)]
*  Republican Governor Brian Kemp, the primary. He lost by a whopping comical 52 points. Look at that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  That's like a Saddam Hussein in Iraq kind of election, okay? Former Georgia Congressman [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  Jody Heiss, who declined to run again the congressional safe seat so he could go and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  primary Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was also a big enemy of Trump in Trump's view, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=436.67999999999995s)]
*  lost by a still whopping though less comical 19 points. So people like Kemp and Raffensperger [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=441.88s)]
*  are in this unique position. They don't have anything to fear politically from Donald Trump. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=448.84s)]
*  The implicit threat that like he controls his base, his followers will defeat you in a primary [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=455.0s)]
*  challenge if you don't do his bidding didn't work. Donald Trump came for them and they defeated him [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=458.76s)]
*  in political combat. They didn't just beat him, they kicked his butt. They are now unburdened. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=464.6s)]
*  They rightly understand that the four times indicted, twice impeached, ex-president is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=469.96s)]
*  politically toxic specifically in their state and specifically to the exact kind of Georgia voters [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=473.32s)]
*  that Georgia Republicans need to consistently win to maintain their electoral fortunes and control [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=479.79999999999995s)]
*  the state and retain power for themselves, which is how politicians tend to think and usually do. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=484.76s)]
*  And so with all that context today, Brian Kemp came out and he answered the question, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=493.08s)]
*  at least for now, of what Georgia Republicans would do about Fonny Willis by effectively [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=497.0s)]
*  telling Donald Trump to take a hike. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=501.88s)]
*  Up to this point, I have not seen any evidence that D.A. Willis's actions or lack thereof warrant [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=505.72s)]
*  action by the prosecuting attorney oversight commission. A special session of the general [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=513.16s)]
*  assembly to end run around this law is not feasible and may ultimately prove to be unconstitutional. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=518.76s)]
*  The bottom line is that in the state of Georgia, as long as I'm governor, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=527.8s)]
*  we're going to follow the law and the constitution, regardless of who it helps or harms [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=532.04s)]
*  politically. And in Georgia, we will not be engaging in political fear that only inflames [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=538.52s)]
*  the emotions of the moment. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=544.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6apeuJE7o4&t=557.0s)]
