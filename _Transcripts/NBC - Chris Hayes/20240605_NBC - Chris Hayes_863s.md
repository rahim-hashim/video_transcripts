# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 4
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo)
*  It has been nearly three and a half years since the attempted coup of January 6th, 2021, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=0.0s)]
*  yet there are still charges coming in nearly every week, it seems, against the people involved, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=3.84s)]
*  both sort of on the ground and in the offices, as it were. Today, it's in Wisconsin where State [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=8.96s)]
*  Attorney General Josh Call announced felony charges of forgery against three men involved [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=14.72s)]
*  in the attempt to submit fake elector votes in 2020. Mike Roman was Trump's campaign head of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=20.32s)]
*  election day operations. James Troupis is a former judge and Trump campaign attorney, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=25.92s)]
*  and Ken Chesbrough, a name you may already be familiar with, is one of the masterminds [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=31.68s)]
*  behind the fake elector's ploy. Chesbrough has already pleaded guilty in the election [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=36.08s)]
*  interference case in Fulton County, Georgia. He is cooperating in Arizona's fake elector's case. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=41.2s)]
*  Mike Roman was also charged in Fulton County and Arizona. This is the first time James [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=46.72s)]
*  Troupis has been charged. He now joins dozens of other lesser-known defendants facing charges in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=51.76s)]
*  the multiple fake elector schemes in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona. Now, of course, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=57.04s)]
*  the reason those were happening in all those different states was one man who was behind it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=65.2s)]
*  all, who was trying to stay in power against the will of the people, and has only been listed as [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=68.96s)]
*  an unindicted co-conspirator in Michigan and Arizona. He is, of course, facing charges in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=73.44s)]
*  Fulton County, Georgia, and federal election interference charges. Currently, he's being [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=78.64s)]
*  essentially bailed out by the Supreme Court that seems intent on delaying the federal trial [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=84.4s)]
*  until after voters go to the polls in November. Joined now by MSNBC legal correspondent and former [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=89.36s)]
*  litigator Lisa Rubin. Lisa, good to have you here. Tell me about these charges brought by [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=94.56s)]
*  the Attorney General of Wisconsin today. So the Attorney General of Wisconsin has done something [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  a little bit more surgical than we've seen in other states, only charging three individuals. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=103.2s)]
*  You mentioned them by name, Ken Chesbrough, Mike Roman, and Jim Trupis. But Wisconsin is the original [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=107.52s)]
*  sin in some ways, because Trupis and Chesbrough were both people who were licensed to practice [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=114.72s)]
*  in Wisconsin. They knew one another. In mid-November is when Trupis and Chesbrough first [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=119.92s)]
*  get together, and Chesbrough says to Trupis, hey, I have this idea. And he writes the memo and shares [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=126.0s)]
*  it with Trupis. That's when Trupis says, hey, I think this has some traction. I'd like to float [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=130.88s)]
*  this with people in the national operation. And then sooner than he knows it, Ken Chesbrough is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=134.96s)]
*  enmeshed in very heavy conversations with people who are then at the center of power and gravity [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=139.6s)]
*  in Trump world. People like Rudy Giuliani or people like Boris Epstein. So one of the things [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  that I think is important for people to know is Wisconsin is where this fake electorate scheme [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=152.0s)]
*  was launched. But it also has particular resonance because Ken Chesbrough actually attended the fake [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  electors meeting in Wisconsin. He went along for the ride. He took pictures of himself. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=163.12s)]
*  There's video of him there. And then finally, his final act before going to January 6th and sort [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=167.84s)]
*  of tagging along with Alex Jones was to deliver the fake electorate certificate from Wisconsin, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=173.52s)]
*  to take it from a Republican Party of Wisconsin part-time staffer, and then give them to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=179.52s)]
*  another staffer on the Hill who was going to ensure that they got into the hands of Mike Pence's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=186.24s)]
*  legislative liaison on the floor of the Senate. It was like, who can we trust? It was like a handoff. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=191.68s)]
*  You'll remember that this- They tried to recruit Ron Johnson, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=196.24s)]
*  Correct. And the Republican Party staffer who was involved in this handoff was sort of so nervous [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=198.96s)]
*  about the whole thing that she infamously texted, I feel like a drug dealer. So I think one of the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=203.36s)]
*  things that's important for people to understand is Ken Chesbrough- The drop. She's talking about [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=208.0s)]
*  the drop. She's talking about the drop of the drug. And she says, I feel like a drug dealer because, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=210.96s)]
*  and I just want to stay on that for a second because that stuck out to me so much. We've seen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=214.4s)]
*  that before. John Bolton described Rudy Giuliani's shenanigans and his off-book operation that was the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=217.84s)]
*  subject of the first impeachment as, I don't want to be involved in whatever Rudy's drug deal is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  And what that term is, is I know there's something illicit happening here. That is a way of- So when [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=228.32s)]
*  you have someone saying, this feels like a drug deal, it's like, right, you understand that this is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=235.28s)]
*  not on the level. No, this is not on the level. And in fact, one of the things that's also [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  distinguishable here is that the 10 fake electors in Wisconsin prior to the bringing of this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=244.8s)]
*  indictment were subject to a civil litigation brought by a number of people, including our [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=249.52s)]
*  friend and colleague, Mary McCord, through Georgetown University. When they settled that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=253.36s)]
*  litigation, they not only admitted wrongdoing, but essentially said, Biden is the lawfully [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=257.44s)]
*  elected president. We were told that we needed to do this in order to preserve the campaign's rights, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=263.52s)]
*  should it prevail in litigation. And we were tricked because we didn't understand that by [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=270.32s)]
*  signing this, they were going to continue the scheme irrespective of whether they won or lost [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=274.56s)]
*  the litigation. And if I'm not mistaken, I don't know if we actually have the document itself as [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=279.44s)]
*  an element, but there's a- Chesbrough himself in one of the documents uses the term weaponized [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=285.92s)]
*  to describe how he wants to marshal the Electoral Count Act, which is the federal law that guides [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=293.76s)]
*  this whole process. We're basically going to weaponize the Electoral Count Act. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=298.16s)]
*  And I think it's important when exactly he says this in this scheme of events too, because [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=301.12s)]
*  on December 16th of 2020, through their friend and fellow Wisconsinite, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=306.24s)]
*  Rance Priebus, who becomes Trump's first White House Chief of Staff, Jim Trubas and Chesbrough [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  go to the White House to meet with Trump. The substance of their conversation isn't discussed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=315.92s)]
*  here, but in other reporting, they basically went to talk to him about what the prospects could be [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  going ahead. And they were warned by Priebus, don't get him overly excited. And of course, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=326.8s)]
*  that's exactly what Chesbrough did. So the next day, Chesbrough is trying to kind of be a more [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  moderating force and says, look, things would have been better if we had won litigation, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=336.8s)]
*  particularly in Wisconsin and other courts, but we still have a chance if we can weaponize the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=342.48s)]
*  Electoral Count Act and sort of use it as a cudgel to show that these Democrats are relying on a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=347.76s)]
*  clearly unconstitutional law to circumscribe the rights of people to debate this in the Senate. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=353.04s)]
*  Those pictures we've been showing us, B-roll with his Chesbrough, they're taking the pictures [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=358.48s)]
*  of the fake Elector ceremony. When I saw that mask on, when I saw that, that there is right now, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  I thought of like the Hollywood trope of like the arsonist that comes to watch the fire. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=367.6s)]
*  It's like, there he is taking it all in, taking it in his hand, you work Lisa Rubin. Thank you very [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  much. Thank you. In an interview with Time Magazine, President Joe Biden was asked whether Israeli [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the siege of Gaza for his own political gain. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=382.72s)]
*  Biden responded, there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=388.16s)]
*  This comes after the Times of Israel recently reported that an aide for Netanyahu told families [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=392.72s)]
*  of the hostages currently in Gaza that Netanyahu's government will not agree to end its war in Gaza [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=397.44000000000005s)]
*  in exchange for a deal to release those remaining in captivity. We should say that was a week ago. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=402.8s)]
*  Two far right parties that are part of Netanyahu's governing coalition are explicitly [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=408.48s)]
*  threatening to quit the government if the deal is accepted, which would then collapse the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=412.88s)]
*  Netanyahu government entirely. All of which makes it odd that Netanyahu has been extended the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=418.64s)]
*  extremely rare privilege of addressing United States Congress as soon as next week by all four [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=425.2s)]
*  bipartisan leaders of Congress, particularly given the fact that one of them, Senate Majority Leader [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=430.24s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, has already called for Netanyahu to resign. The fact that Netanyahu has spent his [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=435.12s)]
*  entire career actively working to get Republicans elected over Democrats here in the U.S. to say [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=440.96s)]
*  nothing of the moral catastrophe that his war in Gaza has wrought on Palestinians, where the chief [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=446.0s)]
*  prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on allegations [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=450.8s)]
*  of war crimes. Senator Bernie Sanders is independent of Vermont. He's chairman of the Health, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=456.08s)]
*  Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. He recently announced he will not be attending [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=460.56s)]
*  Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Senator, were you given, was the Democratic caucus in the Senate [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=464.56s)]
*  given input into this decision to invite him or a heads up? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=472.64s)]
*  Of course, that's a good question. And to the best of my knowledge, there has been very, very little [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=477.52s)]
*  debate on this decision. I think I speak not just for myself, but for a number of other senators who [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=482.88s)]
*  think that that decision is a very, very bad one. You do not honor a foreign leader by addressing [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=490.48s)]
*  a joint session of Congress who is currently engaged in creating the worst humanitarian disaster [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=499.12s)]
*  in the modern history of this country. Obviously, as we all know, Israel has a right to defend itself [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  against Hamas terrorism and the terrible attack of October 7th. But what it is doing now is going [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=512.16s)]
*  to war against the entire Palestinian people. And what we are seeing now is starvation and famine [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=518.64s)]
*  impacting thousands and thousands of children. The architect of that policy is not somebody you honor [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=525.76s)]
*  by bringing to the United States Congress, in my view. I want to play for you something that the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=532.0s)]
*  Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, had to say about you specifically, because I want to give you [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=537.04s)]
*  an opportunity to respond. He's one of the four leaders that invited Netanyahu. And this is what [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=540.24s)]
*  Speaker Johnson had to say about your objections to Netanyahu coming. Take a listen. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=546.24s)]
*  This is a time to choose a side. If Bernie Sanders wants to side with the terrorist, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=552.16s)]
*  that so be it. And if other Democrats want to do that, it's on them. But I'm telling you, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=556.24s)]
*  I pray and hope and expect that most of the members of the House, of both parties and the Senate, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=560.16s)]
*  will join us for this historic address. What do you say to being accused of siding with the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=565.84s)]
*  terrorists if you do not adjoin? I mean, it is a disgusting lie. He said it yesterday. He said it [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=571.84s)]
*  again today. And I guess, you know, if you are part of the MAGA group, right-wing Republicans, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=577.44s)]
*  big lies, what you do, you just say lies over and over again, and you hope people [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=584.32s)]
*  believe them. As I have said from literally day one of this terrible war, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=589.6s)]
*  what Hamas did is atrocious. Sinwa, the leader of Hamas, is a war criminal. He should be [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=594.48s)]
*  in jail. And Israel had every right in the world to defend itself against Hamas. But what, you know, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=601.1199999999999s)]
*  what Johnson is doing is what right-wing people always do. If you, back in the day, if you stood [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  up for civil rights or social justice, they called you a communist. If you are prepared to take on [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=615.52s)]
*  Netanyahu's outrageous war against the Palestinian people, I suppose now they claim that you're [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=622.88s)]
*  sympathetic to terrorism. It is a lie. And I really am not happy with what he is saying. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=627.68s)]
*  It's more than rhetoric. I should note that the House today, a bipartisan vote, a minority of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=634.88s)]
*  Democrats voting for this provision, I think only about 40, and a vast majority of Republicans [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=639.68s)]
*  voting for it. They passed legislation today that would sanction, impose sanctions against [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  the International Criminal Court for its move to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=648.16s)]
*  Netanyahu and other officials for war crimes in the nation's war against Hamas. The bill is [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=652.64s)]
*  unlikely to get a vote in a Democratic-controlled Senate. But since I have you here, I suspect you [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=657.2s)]
*  would not support that, but I want to ask you what you think about the House passing. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, needless to say, I wouldn't support it. And it's a terrible idea. What the function of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=666.88s)]
*  the ICC is, Chris, as you know, is to implement international law, Geneva Convention, and other [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=670.96s)]
*  laws that were established after the horrors of World War II. Last year, the ICC said that Putin [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=680.56s)]
*  is a war criminal, which I believe he is, kidnapping thousands of Ukrainian children [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=688.7199999999999s)]
*  and starting the worst land war in Europe since World War II. He is a war criminal. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  Recently, last month, they said that Sinwa, the leader of Hamas, is a war criminal for having [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=700.88s)]
*  started this war and the terrible atrocities against innocent Israelis. He is. But you know what? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=707.04s)]
*  Netanyahu, who is now bringing about an unprecedented humanitarian disaster, destroying [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=714.7199999999999s)]
*  housing, the infrastructure, the health care system, and creating conditions on which thousands of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=721.76s)]
*  children could starve to death, you know what? That is a violation of international law as well, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  and he should be charged with that. The president came forward and announced an endorsement [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=733.12s)]
*  of the contours of a deal that had been a deal, as far as my understanding, and there's a lot of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=740.7199999999999s)]
*  back and forth on this, so none of this is, it's a little hard to nail down. But the contours of a [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=744.8s)]
*  deal between Israel and Hamas for release of hostages, exchange for cessation of hostilities, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=751.36s)]
*  essentially for some period of time, and then maybe that transitions. It seemed he was attempting [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=757.28s)]
*  to try to stop both sides from backing out of the deal publicly. What is your reaction to him [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=763.28s)]
*  attempting to do that, and do you have hope that this could happen? Well, look, I disagree with [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=771.68s)]
*  the president's general policies toward Israel and what's happening in Gaza, but he is trying [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=778.72s)]
*  on occasion to do the right thing, and I think anyone who is aware of the level of suffering [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  and destruction now in Gaza wants an immediate ceasefire. You need massive amounts of humanitarian [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  aid to save, you know, thousands and thousands of children, and of course Netanyahu, as usual, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=799.8399999999999s)]
*  undermines the president of the United States. And by the way, let's all be clear, this is not [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=807.36s)]
*  some abstract war being fought in another part of the world. We are, to a significant degree, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=813.2s)]
*  as Americans, our tax dollars are funding this war. So Netanyahu is saying, oh, by the way, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=818.4000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, thanks for the $10 billion for unfettered military aid, but we're not going to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  listen to you. We're not going to do anything you want. You know, I think that's outrageous, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=829.9200000000001s)]
*  and that's reason number 465, where he should not be invited to speak to the joint session of Congress. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=833.6s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q02gkCE6Vo&t=840.88s)]
