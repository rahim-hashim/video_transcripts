# ‘Nightmare scenario’: Texas woman ultimately had to flee state for abortion
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU)
*  This is a Republican government at all levels, right, state level, telling a doctor and a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=0.0s)]
*  pregnant woman she cannot receive the medical care she desperately needs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=4.9s)]
*  It is the nightmare scenario come true. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=8.14s)]
*  There it is right now happening before our eyes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=12.3s)]
*  The nightmare scenario the proponents of abortion rights have warned about for 50 years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  It just happened to Kate Cox in Texas and it is coming for everyone. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=20.1s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=24.78s)]
*  This movement, the one that you just saw pursue control over Kate Cox's body to appeal to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=26.18s)]
*  the state Supreme Court to issue threatening letters to the hospitals, that movement is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=36.16s)]
*  not going to relent. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=40.8s)]
*  They will never give up on their aims of exerting that level of control over every single woman's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=43.4s)]
*  body in this country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=49.8s)]
*  Every voter in this country needs to understand that they could be Kate Cox and everyone in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=53.68s)]
*  this country needs to understand that they could be Kate Cox's loved one. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=58.98s)]
*  Kate Cox could be in your family and you could be going through that and we all will be if [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Republicans remain in power and expand that power. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=68.34s)]
*  This is a central issue the Democrats must be talking about in this election up and down [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=73.58s)]
*  the ticket. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=78.8s)]
*  President Joe Biden did release a statement tonight saying in part, no woman should be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=81.84s)]
*  forced to go to court or flee her home state just to receive the health care she needs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=85.54s)]
*  That is exactly what happened in Texas thanks to Republicans elected officials and it is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=90.14s)]
*  simply outrageous. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=94.14s)]
*  This should never happen in America period. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=95.28s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=98.64s)]
*  Republicans know that this spectacle, this despicable spectacle that just went on in Texas [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  is politically toxic for them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=108.12s)]
*  We can tell because they're trying hard to pretend that this didn't just happen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=111.12s)]
*  Get this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=116.12s)]
*  Yesterday Fox News interviewed Texas Governor Greg Abbott and did not ask him a single question [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=117.12s)]
*  about Kate Cox. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=122.12s)]
*  And today both Republican senators from the state of Texas refused to say anything about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=123.84s)]
*  it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=128.56s)]
*  Do you support what the Texas Attorney General did in blocking Kate Cox from getting an abortion [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=129.56s)]
*  after she found out her fetus is unbiased? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=135.08s)]
*  That's strictly a matter of state law, not federal law. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=137.32s)]
*  Are you worried about women in your state whose health may be at risk by Texas laws [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=140.36s)]
*  like Kate Cox? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm a federal official. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  But this is something that's happened in your state. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm not a state official so I'm not going to comment on what state officials are doing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm happy to comment on anything that I'm responsible for. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=153.96s)]
*  Governor, I wanted to get your thoughts on what the Texas Attorney General is doing in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=156.96s)]
*  the case against Kate Cox and blocking her from receiving an abortion. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  Do you have any comment on that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=165.96s)]
*  Just call her President. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  Does the Texas Attorney General agree with what he did? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=168.84s)]
*  Just call her President. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=173.28s)]
*  I have, I actually haven't received an answer. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=174.28s)]
*  So is there anything that you'd like to say right now on this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=175.88s)]
*  Call her President. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=179.32s)]
*  Molly Duane is a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights which represents [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Kate Cox in this case and she joins us now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=184.84s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=187.28s)]
*  First, and I don't want to violate any privacy from a woman and family that have already [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=188.28s)]
*  incredibly bravely put themselves out there, but I do want to ask how Kate Cox is doing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=194.38s)]
*  at this hour. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=199.5s)]
*  She's doing as well as could be expected, but I do want to just sort of wind the wheels [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  back and think about what she's been through over the last week and a half, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  A week and a half ago, she received the worst news of her life, confirmation that her third [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=210.78s)]
*  child had trisomy 18 and would likely be stillborn or at most would survive for minutes, hours, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=215.98s)]
*  or days. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=222.94s)]
*  She was also told that because of her two prior c-sections, she was at increased risk [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=224.24s)]
*  for uterine rupture, hysterectomy, and as you said so eloquently, she wants to have [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=228.96s)]
*  more children. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=234.16s)]
*  She wants to grow her family. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=235.16s)]
*  What did she do in the last week and a half? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=236.88s)]
*  She found a lawyer. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=239.44s)]
*  She decided to file a lawsuit. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  She received an order from a court saying, yes, you are entitled to an abortion. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=242.88s)]
*  Then she had the attorney general threatening her family and her doctors. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=247.88s)]
*  Then she had the Texas Supreme Court say, no, we're going to put a hold on this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=252.54s)]
*  We need more time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  And then she spent three agonizing days waiting for an answer before the Texas Supreme Court [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=258.42s)]
*  said no. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  I forgot. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  They paused that earlier ruling that said, yes, you can get this medical care. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  They said, no, no, no, you can't. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=269.5s)]
*  Wait. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=271.5s)]
*  We're thinking over up here at the Texas State Supreme Court whether we think you should [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=272.5s)]
*  be able to do this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=276.02s)]
*  And she just had to sit there and wait. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=277.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  So, the week is a short amount of time for a court. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=279.22s)]
*  But for a person, a real person in a medical emergency with young children and a family, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=281.66s)]
*  it was agonizing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  She spent most of the weekend in bed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=288.42s)]
*  And so, I just really want people to put themselves in her shoes and think about who they want [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  in the medical room with their husband and their doctors. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  Is it Ken Paxton or not? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=299.22s)]
*  One of the aspects of this case that I think it has highlighted is this notion of exceptions. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=303.74s)]
*  There is under state law in Texas apparently exceptions for women that may need an abortion [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  as a medical necessity. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=317.48s)]
*  We have seen multiple women, including other clients of yours, Amanda Zarowsky among others, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=319.54s)]
*  who have been denied reproductive care. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=325.14s)]
*  They felt they needed under the exception law. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=327.90000000000003s)]
*  What does it say about the actual lived reality of exceptions in the state of Texas or any [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=330.24s)]
*  state that has them if this is what plays out when a so-called exception actually applies? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  This is what I really want people to understand about abortion bans. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  Exceptions don't exist. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=347.04s)]
*  Because if Kay Cox can't get an abortion, then I don't know who can. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=348.6s)]
*  And you often hear about, well, 15 weeks is a compromise or don't worry, there are exceptions. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=352.58s)]
*  People want to pass a 15 week abortion ban. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=358.84s)]
*  I have heard politicians saying that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  That would mean a national 15 week abortion ban that all of us are Kay Cox. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  And she's got nowhere to go. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  Nowhere to go. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  Nowhere to go. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  This is also, I have to say there's a little bit in the ruling, a little bit in the weeds [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=373.96s)]
*  of the ruling, but I actually found this like such, Kay, my wife, who you know, the law [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=380.28s)]
*  to me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=385.24s)]
*  There's something so disingenuously bad faith about the court ruling, which basically says, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=386.24s)]
*  well, if you can get a medical, like if it's a medical necessity, they say a woman who [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=391.76s)]
*  meets the medical necessity exception need not seek a court order to obtain an abortion. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=397.2s)]
*  Under the law, it is a doctor who must decide that a woman is suffering from a life threatening [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=401.48s)]
*  condition during pregnancy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=405.76s)]
*  Basically saying like, what do you mean court order? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=407.36s)]
*  Go ahead if it's medically necessary. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=410.12s)]
*  You have the attorney general of the state writing to threaten this woman with a felony [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=411.88s)]
*  conviction and the court has the gall to say, well, we don't really see a court issue here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=417.24s)]
*  I mean, the doctor can just make the call. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=422.84s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=424.12s)]
*  Let the chips fall where they may. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=425.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm laughing because it's not funny at all, but the courts are saying they don't [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=427.0s)]
*  want to be involved. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=432.96s)]
*  The medical board says they don't want to be involved. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=434.48s)]
*  The attorney general is not going to do anything to help and it's going to run rough shot on [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=437.12s)]
*  the medical community in Texas. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=441.12s)]
*  And meanwhile, real women's real pregnant people's bodies and lives and families hang [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=443.04s)]
*  in the balance and that should be deeply troubling to people across the country. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=449.68s)]
*  What does it say to you? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  And you're a lawyer. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=455.88s)]
*  You're not a politician or a politician staffer, but what does it say to you that the two senators [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=457.2s)]
*  who represent Kate Cox, she's their constituent, have nothing to say about this? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=466.0s)]
*  Greg Abbott doesn't get a question about it when he appears on Fox. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=471.56s)]
*  What does that say to you? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=474.84s)]
*  Well, I have to talk a little bit about Amanda Zyrowski for a moment because I am. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=477.2s)]
*  She's good on this program as well. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=482.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=483.08s)]
*  So I also represent Amanda and 20 women in the state of Texas who are challenging these [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=484.08s)]
*  restrictions before I even met Kate Cox because they and their doctors are saying as loudly [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=488.35999999999996s)]
*  as you can, we don't know how close to death we needed to be. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=494.4s)]
*  Our doctors didn't know and our health suffered as a result. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  And when Amanda Zyrowski testified before the Senate Judiciary hearing, neither of her [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=501.68s)]
*  senators were in the room. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=506.56s)]
*  They came in to make statements, opening statements about how much they opposed abortion and then [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  they left before she testified. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=513.54s)]
*  So the fact that Ted Cruz ran away from reporters asking about Kate Cox doesn't surprise me [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=515.84s)]
*  at all. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=520.82s)]
*  I asked you this beginning, I want to just circle back around again. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=521.82s)]
*  I don't want to violate privacy, but is Kate Cox and her family doing, I mean, I know it's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=524.44s)]
*  been an awful, arduous situation, but is she doing OK? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=529.44s)]
*  She is. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=533.1600000000001s)]
*  She's stayed offline, which I think was probably the best thing one could do in this situation. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  She's doing fine. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=538.2800000000001s)]
*  I appreciate you asking. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  And I have to say with the outpouring of support we have received from people across the country, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=540.6s)]
*  wanting to know if she's OK, wanting to help, offering words of support, it has meant so [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=546.24s)]
*  as her legal team and that I have conveyed to her. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=551.68s)]
*  And I also want to mention that all of the Zyrowski plaintiffs, each of the 20 women [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=554.64s)]
*  who are suing their state because they too were forced to become septic or travel out [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=558.92s)]
*  of state or put their, you know, uteruses and lives and children on the line, they have [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=563.92s)]
*  suffered this roller coaster with her. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=570.28s)]
*  The highs, the lows, the disappointment in their politicians, in their state, the lack [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=572.8s)]
*  of guidance and real empathy and talk about being pro-life. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=578.64s)]
*  Where is the government for these families and these women? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=583.88s)]
*  It's nowhere to be found. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=587.5999999999999s)]
*  I should note that in your update to the court, you did not want to moot the case despite [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=588.5999999999999s)]
*  the fact that the facts have changed, that you want to pursue it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=592.76s)]
*  We will see if that continues. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=595.52s)]
*  I'm Molly Duane, who's doing great lawyering. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=599.4s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=600.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=601.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIRlE_uQXU&t=608.56s)]
