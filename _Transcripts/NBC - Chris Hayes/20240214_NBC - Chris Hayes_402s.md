# ‘I’m pissed off’: Jason Kander reacts to mass shooting at Chiefs Super Bowl parade
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4)
*  Jason Kander served as secretary of state for Missouri from 2013 to 2017. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also on the board of the Gifford Center to prevent gun violence. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=5.12s)]
*  He's from Kansas City, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, and he joins me tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=8.16s)]
*  Jason, it's great to have you on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=12.4s)]
*  I'm sorry it's under these circumstances. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=14.76s)]
*  First, just how are folks there, how are you processing this awful mix of joy and celebration [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=16.6s)]
*  and civic pride ending on this horrible note? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, heartbreaking is not enough. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=30.08s)]
*  Probably like a lot of people watching right now, it's stunning when you actually stop [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=35.2s)]
*  as an American and think about how many people you know personally have either been the victims of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=39.04s)]
*  or at least at the scene of mass shootings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=45.2s)]
*  And for me, it's quite a few. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=48.4s)]
*  And that's before today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=50.56s)]
*  And this is not that big of a town, I promise you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=52.8s)]
*  In fact, I've already sadly heard from some people that for me, this list is going to be bigger. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=56.32s)]
*  And I think that's just increasingly true for so many people watching right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=63.68s)]
*  You're someone who you served in Afghanistan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=69.28s)]
*  You had a sort of iconic ad in which you assembled an assault rifle blindfolded or not looking [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=72.24s)]
*  at the weapon, but then talked about your views on weapons. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=80.32s)]
*  You're on the board of Giffords. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=84.24s)]
*  Missouri is a state that's been almost a leader, a forefront, I would say, in the kind of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  gun absolutist movement. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Do you think today changes that at all? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=97.36s)]
*  Probably not, sadly. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=100.56s)]
*  But I think that that has more to do with the way that this debate has been framed in this country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=102.8s)]
*  It's been very successfully framed by gun manufacturers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  It's been falsely framed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  It's been framed as a debate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=112.8s)]
*  And look, we don't know what weapon was used. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=114.24s)]
*  We don't know motive. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=116.08s)]
*  We don't know any of that stuff. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=116.8s)]
*  I'm not talking about today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm on because today happened and I'm just pissed off. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=119.44s)]
*  And so I want to talk about this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=124.32s)]
*  I want to talk about the fact that they frame this debate as people like me [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=126.72s)]
*  who believe in gun safety versus people who own guns. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=132.24s)]
*  But I also own a gun. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=135.28s)]
*  And I don't think that's what's really going on in this country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=137.28s)]
*  I think this is between Americans and greedy corporations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=140.0s)]
*  They always talk about the Second Amendment. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=144.56s)]
*  But nobody ever talks about the fact that in 2005, they passed a law that infringes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=146.4s)]
*  on the Seventh Amendment, which nobody ever hears about. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=150.64s)]
*  The Seventh Amendment is the amendment to the U.S. Constitution that says, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=153.36s)]
*  if you have in controversy in any matter more than $20, you have a right to a civil jury trial. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=157.36s)]
*  Well, in 2005, we passed this law, a George W. Bush signed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=163.68s)]
*  It's called PLACA. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=167.44s)]
*  It's the what? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=168.4s)]
*  Something Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=170.88s)]
*  It's just a fancy way of saying that they gave the gun industry [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=174.24s)]
*  the kind of immunity that nobody who makes literally any other product in this country gets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=177.6s)]
*  You know how there's like less smoking than there was so many years ago? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=184.16s)]
*  It's not because of Congress. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=187.68s)]
*  It's because of lawsuits. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=188.72s)]
*  That's the reason my car and your car doesn't flip over on the road because of lawsuits. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=189.84s)]
*  That's why truckers have to get a certain amount of sleep before they get on the road. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Congress didn't do that stuff. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=197.52s)]
*  Lawsuits did that stuff, and everybody likes to demonize them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=199.44s)]
*  But when 12 reasonable people can come together, call the jury, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=202.0s)]
*  and make a decision about what's reasonable in their community, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=208.24s)]
*  oftentimes they're going to decide, as they started to in the 90s, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=211.68s)]
*  that gun companies actually can foresee a lot of damage being done [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=215.28s)]
*  and that they can look into who's buying these guns. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=218.88s)]
*  Now, gun companies, by the way, have they have the ability to make guns smart guns. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=221.44s)]
*  Most illegal gun crime happens with stolen guns. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=227.36s)]
*  If smart gun technology were out there, which is never going to get mandated by Congress, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=230.48s)]
*  you wouldn't have this happen. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=234.4s)]
*  But you don't have to change a bunch of laws. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=235.68s)]
*  If you just remove literally like the dumbest law we have on the books, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=238.0s)]
*  the gun industry is going to police itself. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=243.12s)]
*  They're going to be begging us to police them because of the liability they're going to have. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=244.8s)]
*  So that's what I think about in addition to the people in my community who have been hurt. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  This is the governmental side of what I think about on a day like today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=254.88s)]
*  It makes me very angry. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=258.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, think about this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  When you see these images, of course, the danger of just this object and it being out there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=261.76s)]
*  And there's all sorts of ways, all sorts of things. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=268.24s)]
*  There's all the security, there's safety. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=270.56s)]
*  You've got police officers, you've got areas taped off. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=272.4s)]
*  You don't want cars going there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=275.84s)]
*  There's all sorts of ways in which the space is protected and regulated. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=277.76s)]
*  And yet this one device, which is a particularly deadly and dangerous device, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=281.36s)]
*  and we have more of them in our country than anywhere else, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=286.64s)]
*  is going to end up at a scene like that, as we're seeing now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  And the aftermath of it will be predictable. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  And we have to find some way of attacking that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=294.8s)]
*  And I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=298.48s)]
*  Yeah. Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=301.68s)]
*  What they do is they try and overwhelm us with the difficulty of the problem. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=302.88s)]
*  They say over and over again, like in assault weapons, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=307.92s)]
*  how are you going to define what an assault weapon is? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  Which is a stupid question, but let's pretend it's not for a second. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=312.72s)]
*  Or they'll say, well, how are you going to, you know, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  they'll say, well, this crime or that crime was committed with a gun that was already illegal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=319.04s)]
*  It was illegal for them to have a gun. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=323.04s)]
*  Oh, and then you say, well, should we perhaps pass smart gun technology and require it? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=324.48s)]
*  They say, well, how are you going to define that? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, the answer is you just let juries do it over and over and over again. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  And pretty soon, gun companies, here's what they're going to do. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=334.8s)]
*  I promise you, not only are they going to do all these things on their own to avoid [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=338.8s)]
*  losing their butt in court all the time, they're going to end up making a ton of money [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  because they'll start gun insurance, side companies, subsidiaries. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=346.96s)]
*  And then, you know, you'll have, you'll have a registry of guns because they can't create [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=350.64s)]
*  a need for gun insurance if they don't know everybody who owns their guns. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  So they're going to make plenty of money if we do it the other way. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=360.08s)]
*  They don't want to do anything difficult. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=363.6s)]
*  So all we got to do is get rid of one stupid law, and a whole lot of other things that we need in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=364.96s)]
*  order to keep people safe in this country are going to happen. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=369.84s)]
*  Jason Kander, proud son of Kansas City. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=373.2s)]
*  And great to have you on. I'm sorry it's under these circumstances. Great to see you, though, sir. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=376.56s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltzfeFeiP4&t=381.2s)]
