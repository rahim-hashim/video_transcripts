# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Sept. 29
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U)
*  Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy's Republican Conference has brought us to the brink of another government shutdown a little over more than 24 hours from now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic Senate has designed its park, advancing broadly bipartisan legislation to keep the government funded and therefore open. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=9.0s)]
*  The House could very easily do the same thing based on a budget framework they already agreed to. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=16.0s)]
*  Remember, remember we went through this part of the deal they struck over the summer to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=22.0s)]
*  They raised the debt ceiling, Kevin McCarthy met with Joe Biden, they worked it out, they struck a deal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=27.0s)]
*  But now they don't like that. They won't sign on to it. Right now it looks like that's not going to happen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=30.0s)]
*  You see there's a small group in the House that wants a shutdown and wants McCarthy to lose his job as Speaker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=35.0s)]
*  Partly because they want to enact severe, drastic, brutally cruel, unprecedented austerity cuts to a bunch of different social programs like stuff for women and infant children or to poor schools. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=41.0s)]
*  And partly because Donald Trump told them to. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=53.0s)]
*  Today, Speaker McCarthy tried to appease his conference with a wildly extreme government funding bill that did a lot of those cruel cuts. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=57.0s)]
*  But even that failed when 21, mostly MAGA Republicans sunk the deal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=64.0s)]
*  The thing that's really so important to understand about the shutdown is that probably I would say 98% of members of Congress across both houses think it's utterly stupid. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=69.0s)]
*  They think the people pushing the shutdown are dangerous fools. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=80.0s)]
*  Just listen to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=83.0s)]
*  There's only one person to blame for any potential government shutdown and that's Matt Gaetz. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=86.0s)]
*  He's not a conservative Republican, he's a charlatan. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=93.0s)]
*  And as far as I'm concerned, when you're working with Democrats to try to vacate the Speaker, you're a joke. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=96.0s)]
*  Okay, now, Lawler may be correct that Gaetz is a charlatan, but he's incorrect that there is one person to blame here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=105.0s)]
*  What he is missing is that Matt Gaetz is perfectly in line with and taking his orders directly from another Republican. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=111.0s)]
*  Guy you've probably heard of, the quadruple indicted disgraced ex-President Donald Trump. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=118.0s)]
*  Gaetz openly boasted about this much last week when he took to Trump's social media platform to share this quote from an article about the shutdown. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=123.0s)]
*  Quote, President Donald Trump said Republicans should reject the Speaker's plan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=130.0s)]
*  There you have it, folks. Trump said we should reject a deal and we're rejecting the deal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=134.0s)]
*  The open public disdain House Republicans hold for someone like Matt Gaetz and his Confederates in the extremist wing of the party [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=139.0s)]
*  should of course be exactly how they view Donald Trump, the guy calling the shots. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=146.0s)]
*  And indeed, if Donald Trump, that guy, the guy you see on your screen, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=151.0s)]
*  if he were just some random member of the Freedom Caucus from a safe Republican district, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=155.0s)]
*  Republicans would roll their eyes at him and they'd complain about him in the press like tough guy Mike Lawler does about Matt Gaetz. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=160.0s)]
*  But do you think Mike Lawler says that about Donald Trump? No, he does not. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=166.0s)]
*  No, he does not. Because Donald Trump is not just some random Congressional backbencher. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=170.0s)]
*  No, no, that's easy for Mike Lawler to do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=175.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is the most powerful figure in the Republican Party. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=178.0s)]
*  Republicans in the House, Kevin McCarthy in particular, are learning the same lesson that the rest of us learned nearly a decade ago. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=181.0s)]
*  That it's impossible to negotiate with Donald Trump and those doing his bidding because their demands are effectively impossible to give into. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=187.0s)]
*  If you look at what Trump has said about the shutdown and you ask, what does he want? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=195.0s)]
*  He wants his criminal cases closed. He wants the prosecutors fired or worse. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=199.0s)]
*  He wants to effectively end the American rule of law. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=203.0s)]
*  He wants to install himself as the authoritarian leader of this country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=206.0s)]
*  When he gets the nomination of the Republican Party, Mike Lawler is probably going to endorse him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=210.0s)]
*  Those are Donald Trump's demands and by extension the demands of many of his MAGA obstructionists in Congress. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=214.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy knows he can't give in, but he's such a weak leader it's not clear if he has an alternative. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=220.0s)]
*  Ben LeBolt serves as White House Communications Director and he joins me now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=226.0s)]
*  Ben, what is the White House's current understanding of what happens now? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=231.0s)]
*  It's my job to follow this and I will admit that I am confused. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=235.0s)]
*  Well look, it's very possible we go into a shutdown tomorrow night at midnight. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=239.0s)]
*  And as you laid out right there, this is totally the fault of House Republicans and the MAGA wing in the party. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=245.0s)]
*  This is another manufactured crisis by them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=251.0s)]
*  They threatened to crash the economy earlier this year over the debt ceiling crisis, which they also manufactured. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=254.0s)]
*  But out of that, they agreed to a bipartisan budget agreement with the President, with the House, with the Senate that laid out a plan to fund the government moving forward. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=261.0s)]
*  Well now they're walking away from that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=271.0s)]
*  Speaker Gingrich, who used to shut down the government at the drop of a hat, said he didn't even know what this was about or why they wanted to shut down the government this time around. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=274.0s)]
*  As you pointed out, they take their orders from Donald Trump. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=282.0s)]
*  The MAGA wing of the party seems to be in control here and unless their extreme list of ideological demands is met, they're going to shut things down tomorrow night. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=286.0s)]
*  How do you understand the end game? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=296.0s)]
*  Because of what Speaker Gingrich said and what others have said, there's a few different ones. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=298.0s)]
*  So you could have Kevin McCarthy bring something to the House floor that he knows will lose some Republicans but will pass with large bipartisan majorities, for instance the Senate CR. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=305.0s)]
*  Some kind of discharge position in which the eight or nine Republicans team up with Democrats to bring something to the floor. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=317.0s)]
*  Or what? How do you understand it? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=325.0s)]
*  Well look, the end game that would make sense for the American people and that the President supports is most of the leaders in Congress and the President have agreed on a plan to fund the government. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=329.0s)]
*  Leader McConnell has agreed on that plan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=339.0s)]
*  Leader Schumer has agreed on that plan. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=342.0s)]
*  Leader Jeffries has agreed on that plan. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=343.0s)]
*  The President thinks the Senate should pass that legislation and the House should pass that legislation. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=345.0s)]
*  And then we wouldn't have active duty troops going without pay. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=349.0s)]
*  We wouldn't have women and children who need food assistance having access to food this week. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=353.0s)]
*  We wouldn't have travel disruptions at the FAA and all the other things that will happen if the government shuts down. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=358.0s)]
*  But what's clear is that Speaker McCarthy may not have control over his conference. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=364.0s)]
*  This is something that he needs to work out with the MAGA wing of the party if the government is going to stay open. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=369.0s)]
*  And he needs to take control here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=375.0s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene said I think today or yesterday, I think it was today, that a shutdown would be salutary. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=378.0s)]
*  I shouldn't use that word. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=384.0s)]
*  But it would be good maybe bracing for the American people, for Washington, to understand what it was like to shut down during COVID, I think was the argument. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=386.0s)]
*  Do you think there's any upside to a shutdown? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=393.0s)]
*  Look, this is the same sort of ideology over outcomes that we've heard from the MAGA wing of the party where they'd rather prove a point than help serve the daily lives of hardworking people across the country. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=397.0s)]
*  And they're playing with fire here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=411.0s)]
*  So many people will be impacted. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=413.0s)]
*  So many people will be forced to go to work but without pay. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=415.0s)]
*  That's going to have an impact on morale. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=418.0s)]
*  It's going to have an impact on attendance. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=420.0s)]
*  And the basic operations of the government that a lot of people across the country rely on every day, if you have a problem with your Social Security check, for example, who can you call if government workers are furloughed? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=422.0s)]
*  Why would we put active duty troops on the line here and refuse to pay them when 2 million of them are defending our country? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=435.0s)]
*  So this is just about pleasing their ideological extreme factions, getting cable hits, making extreme headlines. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=444.0s)]
*  And it's hardworking Americans that will pay the price. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=454.0s)]
*  Yeah, not just cable hits. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=457.0s)]
*  They are also doing some podcast hits. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=458.0s)]
*  I just want to be fair. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=460.0s)]
*  After the meeting today, a bunch of them, Andy Biggs, I think went, they all did like a group emergency pod. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=462.0s)]
*  So I think they did get some good podcast content, which, you know, got to respect that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=468.0s)]
*  This is what the president had to say in a sit down interview earlier today with John Harwood from ProPublica about his views on why this is happening. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=472.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=480.0s)]
*  The speaker's made a terrible bargain in order to keep the speakership. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=482.0s)]
*  He's willing to do things that he I think he knows are inconsistent with constitutional processes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=487.0s)]
*  Number one. Number two. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=494.0s)]
*  I think it says that there is a group of mega Republicans who generally want to have a fundamental change in the way that the system works. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=495.0s)]
*  And that's what worries me the most. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=506.0s)]
*  That fundamental change. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=509.0s)]
*  How do you how should we understand what he means by that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=511.0s)]
*  Well, I think he really addressed it in Phoenix yesterday when he was honoring John McCain talking about the need to preserve democratic institutions in this country after a series of comments that had been made by the MAGA wing of the party over the past several weeks. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=515.0s)]
*  They have attacked the free press. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=530.0s)]
*  They have attacked the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the military accused him of treason. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=533.0s)]
*  Said in a different time he would have been executed. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=540.0s)]
*  They've said a bunch of things that could incite political violence and certainly don't speak to preserving democratic institutions in this country. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=545.0s)]
*  They don't believe in the separation of powers. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=552.0s)]
*  And that is not politics as usual. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=554.0s)]
*  That's an extreme threat to our democracy. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=557.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=560.0s)]
*  In point of fact, Paul Gosar, a Republican member from Arizona, said that in another time, the sodomy loving that quizzling would be hung. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=561.0s)]
*  That's what he had to say about Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=568.0s)]
*  Ben LeBolt, thank you very much. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=572.0s)]
*  Much more will be said about it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=578.0s)]
*  We'll have so much time to talk and brag about Dianne Feinstein. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=580.0s)]
*  Her legacy will be a long one that we have all we will all be inspired by. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=584.0s)]
*  But today, at this time, just hours since her passing, rather than talk about her, let us just pray that she rests in peace. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=590.0s)]
*  In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all present in the chamber as well as members and staff throughout the Capitol to please rise for a moment of silence and remembrance of the late honorable Senator Dianne Feinstein. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=599.0s)]
*  This morning, Speaker of the House of America Nancy Pelosi gathered the California House delegation to the floor of the chamber for a moment of silence to honor the passing of Senator Dianne Feinstein. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=620.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Barbara Lee is a Democratic member of the California delegation representing Oakland and surrounding areas just across the San Francisco Bay from where the late senator began her political journey. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=641.0s)]
*  She's also declared herself as a candidate for Senate in California. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=650.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Lee joins me now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=653.0s)]
*  It's good to have you, Congresswoman. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=655.0s)]
*  Nice being with you, Chris. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=657.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, you obviously have served alongside in a different house, Dianne Feinstein, for decades representing Californians and knew her well and just would love to hear reflections on how you're feeling on the day of her passing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=659.0s)]
*  Chris, today is really a very sad day. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=677.0s)]
*  I was in the Senate chambers where members of the California delegation honored her also on the House floor. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=681.0s)]
*  And, you know, we're really mourning and mourning, grieving, but also we have to celebrate her life. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=688.0s)]
*  And what a remarkable life. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=695.0s)]
*  I mean, Senator Feinstein was an icon. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=697.0s)]
*  She led on so many issues as a woman before anyone was leading on issues. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=700.0s)]
*  Men are women, for example, on the LGBTQ plus struggle and fight for equal rights. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=706.0s)]
*  She was there on issues around gun control and the footage you had about her on the Senate floor. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=712.0s)]
*  That was classic, Dianne. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=719.0s)]
*  And here we are now in a moment where we have to pass the assault weapon ban because Dianne Feinstein fought for safe communities and for and she saved lives through her legislation with the assault weapon ban. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=720.0s)]
*  Finally, I'll just say as on a personal note, right after the authorization to use military force came forward in 2001, Senator Feinstein, of course, I was the only one that voted against that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=734.0s)]
*  Everyone else voted for it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=747.0s)]
*  But Senator Feinstein, and this just shows you how kind she was. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=748.0s)]
*  She was a painter and she knew I loved orchids and she painted a beautiful orchid and sent it to me and marked the date and signed it for me. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=752.0s)]
*  And it was a gesture of kindness and love, even though she disagreed with me. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=765.0s)]
*  But that was her. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=769.0s)]
*  And I have that hanging in my place here in D.C. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=770.0s)]
*  And every day I look at that because she really brought forth what a true public servant is, could be, and also was, but also a kind and gentle spirit. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=773.0s)]
*  So, Indra, that's a fascinating story. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=787.0s)]
*  And of course, you were when you voted against the authorization to use the military force, you were the lone vote in the House and the lone vote in both houses, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=789.0s)]
*  I think it passed unanimously in the Senate as well. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=799.0s)]
*  And it's interesting that you talk about that and that gesture of her because some, I think, who have looked at your career and look at her career would say you have sort of different politics or have come through different parts of the Democratic Party. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=802.0s)]
*  But it sounds like you feel a profound sense of respect for her. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=816.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=819.0s)]
*  And we work together on many issues. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=821.0s)]
*  I mean, I represent Oakland, Berkeley, California, the 12th Congressional District, and she helped me with delivering federal funds to my district and the entire state. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=824.0s)]
*  We worked on issues together. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=834.0s)]
*  And not everyone agrees with everyone all of the time. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=836.0s)]
*  But I think because of who she was and being able to get the job done, you can see her legacy working with Republicans, working with moderates, working with progressives. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=839.0s)]
*  She cared about people. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=851.0s)]
*  She cared about her state and she would work with anyone as long as we were committed to doing the right thing. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=852.0s)]
*  Also, let me just say she had a keen sense of why diversity matters. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=858.0s)]
*  And we were on the Senate floor listening to the Tribune. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=864.0s)]
*  Senator Padilla mentioned how he had worked in her office. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=866.0s)]
*  And there was an African-American man named Percy Pinkney, who she tasked with representing her in the black community. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=869.0s)]
*  And he did a phenomenal job. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=876.0s)]
*  You know, and Percy was her representative. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=878.0s)]
*  And we knew when Percy was there, Senator Feinstein would hear what the concerns were and that she would act on it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=881.0s)]
*  And so today, my thoughts and prayers go out to her family. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=887.0s)]
*  I know it's a very difficult time. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=890.0s)]
*  Condolences to her friends, extended family. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=892.0s)]
*  And we have to take a moment to just, yes, mourn and grieve, but also celebrate her wonderful life. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=895.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, I have you here. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=902.0s)]
*  You talked about issues you've worked across party lines or across lines within the Democratic Party. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=904.0s)]
*  And since I have you here and there's the shutdown happening, I wanted to ask you about one other issue that you were really committed to, which is PEPFAR. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=908.0s)]
*  That's the Global Fund that was started under the Bush administration. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=915.0s)]
*  It was an amazing sort of coalition of left-right folks to fund low-cost and free AIDS medicine in Africa. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=919.0s)]
*  It has saved probably millions of lives. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=927.0s)]
*  It's probably the best thing that came out of the Bush administration. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=929.0s)]
*  There is a targeted campaign among your House colleagues on the right in the Republican caucus to attack PEPFAR, to go after it as these appropriation bills come through. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=932.0s)]
*  And I would just wanted to get your response to this, which has been a wildly successful intervention, bipartisan effort, the attacks on it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=943.0s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=955.0s)]
*  Yes, PEPFAR was actually my idea. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=956.0s)]
*  I brought that idea to President Bush in a meeting, and we put forth legislation. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=958.0s)]
*  I worked with him and the White House and everyone, Secretary Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and we put together what is known as PEPFAR. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=963.0s)]
*  We've saved 25 lives. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=973.0s)]
*  And let me tell you, Senator Frist, Senator Vinn, Senator Kerry, Henry Hyde, Congressman Lantos, we all worked together to keep this and make this a bipartisan initiative. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=974.0s)]
*  Again, saved 25 lives, and we extended it with just a clean extension for five years every five years. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=986.0s)]
*  Now we have those in the House, most of which are the mega extremists, who are trying to derail us by trying to insert language that they know would be a poison pill. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=994.0s)]
*  And so right now I'm negotiating with the Republicans to try to get it extended. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=1007.0s)]
*  We're going to stay on this issue, Arizona. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=1012.0s)]
*  Congressman Barberle, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=1014.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8K94ZOyx5U&t=1016.0s)]
