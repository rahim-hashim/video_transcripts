# ‘Do not forget’: Bernie Sanders has a message if you’re worried about Trump 2.0
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08)
*  When the Trump administration froze federal funding this week, Senator Bernie Sanders [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=0.0s)]
*  of Vermont warned the order is a dangerous move towards authoritarianism, writing, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=4.0s)]
*  If President Trump wants to change our nation's laws, he has the right to ask Congress to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=8.48s)]
*  change them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=12.32s)]
*  He does not have the right to violate the United States Constitution. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=13.32s)]
*  He is not a king. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=16.32s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, joins me now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=18.56s)]
*  Senator, you know, it's striking to me that members of your august body who say whatever [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=22.04s)]
*  you want about them generally like their own power, would willingly move to confirm a man [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=29.02s)]
*  in Russell's vote who is before the Budget Committee to head OMB when it is the position [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=36.1s)]
*  of that individual that the President has every right to completely bypass the Senate [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=40.5s)]
*  and the Budget Committee on matters of spending. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=45.54s)]
*  Do you, what do you think is going to happen here? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=48.5s)]
*  I think everything being an equal vote is going to win. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  I suspect all of virtually all Democrats will vote against him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=58.18s)]
*  I think all Republicans will vote for him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  You know, what Raphael Warnock was just talking about a moment ago about the devastating cuts [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=64.02s)]
*  to programs that working families, low income people need is absolutely correct. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=69.54s)]
*  And I'm glad that we fought back and for the moment, at least, we have managed to get [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=74.66s)]
*  that freeze rescinded. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=81.14s)]
*  But the key point here is that what Trump did is illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=83.10000000000001s)]
*  The power of the purse rests with Congress, your point, and not with the executive. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=90.5s)]
*  You know, the founding fathers were pretty smart about that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=96.42s)]
*  They divided up the power. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  But I'll tell you something, when you talk about authoritarianism, Chris, it is not only [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  vote and the power of the OMB and what Trump is doing, it is also, I'm sure you have noticed, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=105.98s)]
*  his lawsuits against the media when they do things that he's not happy with. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  So you've got to sue it against ABC. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  You've got to sue it against the Des Moines Register. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  You've got to, Metta apparently gave him $25 million today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=124.1s)]
*  So what goes on? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, if you say something tomorrow that Trump doesn't like, maybe he will sue NBC. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=130.26s)]
*  And maybe your bosses will say, hey, Chris, you've got to calm it down a little bit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=135.74s)]
*  We can't afford $50 million to Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  So this is a real movement toward authoritarianism. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  And when you add on top of that the movement toward oligarchy, three richest guys in America [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=146.78s)]
*  standing beside Trump at its inauguration, we've got a lot of problems facing our country [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=152.38s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=157.76s)]
*  I just want to note, since you brought it up, one thing that has been amazing to me [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=158.76s)]
*  is all of the encouragement we've gotten from the folks here that run this news organization, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  we're going to do what we do under the First Amendment fairly and precisely with neither [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=166.58s)]
*  fear or favor. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=170.78s)]
*  And I'm confident in that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=172.62s)]
*  I really am. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=174.18s)]
*  And I think your point about the suing is wild. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=175.18s)]
*  I want to actually stay on that for one moment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=177.34s)]
*  I don't think we've ever seen president as plaintiff before. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=179.58s)]
*  It's a very bizarre situation that I don't think everyone's got in their head around. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=185.02s)]
*  There's a bunch of Supreme Court president about whether the president can be sued. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=189.86s)]
*  The idea of the president doing the suing and other people paying him settlements, that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  seems kind of odd. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, it's not odd. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=202.32s)]
*  It is extraordinarily dangerous. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=205.12s)]
*  That is, if that's not undermining the First Amendment, I don't know what is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=207.96s)]
*  So if you think that people in media are not going to be looking over their shoulders worrying [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=213.34s)]
*  about a lawsuit for Donald Trump, you are mistaken. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=219.48s)]
*  So we are in a dangerous situation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=224.04s)]
*  We are in an unprecedented situation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=227.56s)]
*  But here's what I want to say to listeners who are justifiably very worried. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=230.88s)]
*  Do not forget that while Republicans control the House and the Senate, their margins are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=236.76s)]
*  slim. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=242.72s)]
*  Slim. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=243.72s)]
*  All right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=244.72s)]
*  They don't have 60 votes in the Senate. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=245.72s)]
*  They got what is it, a four vote majority in the House. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  That ain't a lot of votes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=251.44s)]
*  And a number of Republicans, one by a small margin in Democratic districts, they are susceptible [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=253.04s)]
*  to citizen outrage. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  So get on the phone. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=264.48s)]
*  If you see these guys doing something like wanting to give huge tax breaks to billionaires [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  while they cut Medicare, if they want to go drill, baby, drill while we have been facing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=270.68s)]
*  an existential threat of climate change, if they want to deport 20 million people in this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=275.44s)]
*  country, stand up, fight back. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=281.24s)]
*  We can beat them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=283.44s)]
*  So let's not act in a hopeless way. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=284.88s)]
*  Oh my God, we can't do anything. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=287.0s)]
*  We can. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=288.54s)]
*  Longer term, obviously, we need to do what the Democratic Party has not done, has become [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=289.54s)]
*  the party of the working class, develop a strong grassroots movement with labor unions, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  with young people, with people of color, and organize and fight back. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=302.08s)]
*  The progressive agenda, and I say this over and over again, is the people's agenda. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=307.0s)]
*  It is wildly popular. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=312.16s)]
*  People understand the current health care system is broken. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=314.28s)]
*  They want universal health care. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=317.92s)]
*  Health care is a human right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=319.72s)]
*  They want to raise the salvation minimum wage of seven and a quarter to a living wage. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=320.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=325.2s)]
*  I mean, you've got, and it connects to your first point, which is that it's not like all [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=326.2s)]
*  this is a fait accompli. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=330.64s)]
*  Robert Kennedy Jr., who you interviewed and you asked him about those onesies, which was [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=332.12s)]
*  an instantly iconic moment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=336.68s)]
*  I'm not going to play it now because I want to get your answer here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=337.96s)]
*  I don't think it's a sure thing that he's going to be confirmed. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=340.92s)]
*  And I thought the concerns from some Republicans were quite persuasive, including Senator Cassidy [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=343.64s)]
*  used to be a doctor. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=348.6s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=349.6s)]
*  Well, I sit next to Senator Cassidy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=350.6s)]
*  He was the ranking member, and I was the chair, and I'm the ranking member. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=353.12s)]
*  He's the chair. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=356.76s)]
*  He is a doctor, and he's nobody's fool. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=357.76s)]
*  He is concerned about Kennedy's absurd attacks and lies about vaccines and autism. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=361.64s)]
*  And we will see what happens. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=372.2s)]
*  What we should appreciate is there'll be an enormous amount of pressure on Cassidy, on [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=374.68s)]
*  other Republicans. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=379.12s)]
*  But his line of questioning was, I think, very commendable. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=380.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=383.44s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, who asked Kennedy if he could just say whether vaccines and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=384.44s)]
*  autism were linked, wouldn't answer his question. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=388.08s)]
*  Thank you so much, Senator. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=390.16s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=391.16s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V91Mr10A08&t=392.16s)]
