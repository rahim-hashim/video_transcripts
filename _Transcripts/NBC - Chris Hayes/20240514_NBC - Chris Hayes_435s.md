# Trump lawyer 'in over his head' with Michael Cohen cross-examination
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ)
*  During the first day of Michael Cohen's cross-examination, the defense aimed to make one thing very clear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen has been allegedly obsessed with Donald Trump even since before he became president. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's defense attorney Todd Blanch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=12.0s)]
*  You were actually obsessed with President Trump, weren't you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=14.0s)]
*  Cohen, I don't know if I would characterize the word obsessed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=17.0s)]
*  I admired him tremendously. Blanch. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=20.0s)]
*  In Disloyal, that would be Cohen's first book, you describe your feeling for President Trump as being obsessed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=23.0s)]
*  Correct? Cohen. Correct. Blanch. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=29.0s)]
*  But your obsession for, you admired him even before you started working for him, correct? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=32.0s)]
*  Cohen. That's correct. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=37.0s)]
*  Joining us now are Lisa Rubin, MSNBC legal correspondent who was inside that courthouse today, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=40.0s)]
*  and Charles Coleman, former New York prosecutor, now a criminal defense and civil rights attorney. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=45.0s)]
*  Thank you. It's very good to have some legal minds weighing in on this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=50.0s)]
*  And Lisa, let me start with you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=53.0s)]
*  The idea that Michael Cohen was effectively like a single white female-like character in Trumpland, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=54.0s)]
*  is the point of that from a defense point of view to suggest that Cohen might have acted on his own [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=59.0s)]
*  to make the Stormy Daniels problem go away for Trump? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Yes. Did they do that? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=68.0s)]
*  No. I'm being cross-examined now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=70.0s)]
*  I'm answering the questions squarely before me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=73.0s)]
*  No, I don't think they did, Alex. I think they were trying to both show he was motivated to do it alone, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=76.0s)]
*  and he was so obsessed with Trump that having been spurned by him, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=81.0s)]
*  he is engaging in a scorched earth strategy to make the man's life miserable [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=84.0s)]
*  in a way that's undeserving of whatever Trump has done that could be criminally charged. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=89.0s)]
*  And I don't think they succeeded. I wrote down after reading the cross-examination [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=95.0s)]
*  all the different themes that they floated today, and not a single one of them was a winner, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=99.0s)]
*  at least today on this cross. He's media hungry, but he was before, too. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=104.0s)]
*  He's wealthy. Yes, he was before, too. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=109.0s)]
*  He wouldn't take direction from the DA in terms of shutting up about the case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Okay, but does that make him not credible? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=117.0s)]
*  He was a leaker. They insinuated that he was leaking information to the press, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=119.0s)]
*  and he never got anywhere with that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=123.0s)]
*  So unless they can establish that that actually happened [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=125.0s)]
*  and that he was destructive to the DA's case, I'm not sure where that goes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=129.0s)]
*  He's an incentivized witness because he dislikes Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=132.0s)]
*  He's also a person who was the only person who served jail time [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=135.0s)]
*  for crimes related to the ones that are being charged. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=138.0s)]
*  And he was sent back to prison retributively during COVID [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=141.0s)]
*  after he was released on home confinement. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=144.0s)]
*  If he has an axe to grind, it's a deserved one. He has a binder. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=146.0s)]
*  Woo! The DA's office gave him a binder with his plea allocution in it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=150.0s)]
*  That's supposed to make him somehow biased. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=154.0s)]
*  No, that's to refresh his recollection about things solely within his knowledge. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=157.0s)]
*  And then the final one is that he messed with his phones [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=161.0s)]
*  before he gave them to the DA's office. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=164.0s)]
*  The insinuation is the FBI returned them to him in 2020. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=166.0s)]
*  The DA's office didn't ask for them until 2023. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=170.0s)]
*  And the insinuation is either Cohen or a man named Jeremy Rosenberg, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=173.0s)]
*  who was an investigator in the DA's office, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=176.0s)]
*  somehow messed with the phones so as to edit that September 6, 2016 phone call [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=179.0s)]
*  through which Trump makes the most damning admissions in the case. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=185.0s)]
*  Charles? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=189.0s)]
*  I rest. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=190.0s)]
*  So, the defense's strategy here is that they have no strategy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=191.0s)]
*  And what I mean by that is they do not have strong facts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=196.0s)]
*  This is clear. We all knew this going in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=200.0s)]
*  And so, in order to try and get to the point of a hung jury or a mistrial, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=203.0s)]
*  your strategy is confusion and misdirection. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=208.0s)]
*  And that's everything that they've been doing with respect to the different legal theories that they have tried to float. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=211.0s)]
*  Now, I have been one as an attorney who is loathe to critique and criticize other attorneys in terms of how they try cases. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=216.0s)]
*  But we are at the point where I can honestly say that Todd Blanch may be in over his head [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=223.0s)]
*  because this is state court. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=230.0s)]
*  And I want to point that out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=232.0s)]
*  He has spent a lot of his career as a federal prosecutor. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=233.0s)]
*  That is very different than being a criminal defense attorney in state court, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=237.0s)]
*  primarily because as a federal prosecutor, you do not try many cases. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=242.0s)]
*  You settle cases a lot. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=247.0s)]
*  And in the cases that you actually try, many of the defendants do not testify. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=249.0s)]
*  So, quite frankly, you are not as used to cross-examination as you would be if you were an attorney who practices in state court. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=254.0s)]
*  That's the value of what we're talking about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=262.0s)]
*  So, I think that in terms of Donald Trump's federal cases, he might be the guy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=264.0s)]
*  But in this situation right now, I feel like Necklace would have been a much better choice to conduct this cross-examination. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=269.0s)]
*  Can I ask just, I mean, I don't just want to over-determine this because I watched this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=275.0s)]
*  You know, I was there in the courthouse in the overflow room during cross. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=279.0s)]
*  I find myself having a hard time following it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=282.0s)]
*  But also, I'm a very, I'm not the median juror, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=284.0s)]
*  So, the one thing that was clear to me and did seem effective is Cohen seemed shifty. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=289.0s)]
*  I mean, he did. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=294.0s)]
*  He seemed, he was taking sips of water. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=295.0s)]
*  He basically seemed like he was, I would describe him as squirrely, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=297.0s)]
*  And, you know, confronted with things that he had in the past, there were moments where you felt like he was reluctantly maybe getting to the truth, but not particularly like forthcoming. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=301.0s)]
*  Does that add up to them eviscerating any of the core facts? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=312.0s)]
*  No. Does it, to my mind, defeat the burden or get at the burden? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=316.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=321.0s)]
*  But I'm just curious what you thought as someone who's also watching it, like whether that, how much that matters, whether that's enough to get you where you need to go. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=322.0s)]
*  I actually thought Cohen's worst moment of the day was on direct, but I don't know how many people appreciated it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=329.0s)]
*  At the civil fraud trial where Cohen testified, he was asked about the plea he took before Judge Pauley in the Southern District. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=334.0s)]
*  And he has insisted since then that actually while he pled guilty to tax evasion, he didn't really commit the crime. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=340.0s)]
*  And he was asked by Alina Haba, basically, were you lying then or are you lying now? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=345.0s)]
*  And he said squarely on the stand there, I was lying. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=349.0s)]
*  When asked to explain that testimony today, on the other hand, Cohen gave him a very different answer. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=353.0s)]
*  And he basically said, well, I'm not contesting the facts, but I didn't like the process. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=360.0s)]
*  That's not going to play well on cross with a well-prepped cross examiner. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=365.0s)]
*  Correct. But Chris, to your point, ultimately, I think a lot of that depends on the characterization that the prosecution tries to put forward about him on summation. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=369.0s)]
*  Are you going to try and sell Michael Cohen as this sort of reform guy who really stood up for country and liberty and freedom and truth and justice? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=377.0s)]
*  Or are you going to say, look, this was a guy who was in cahoots with Donald Trump. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=386.0s)]
*  He's kind of a guy who may have been a little bit of a schlep. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=390.0s)]
*  And now he's finally figured it out that this was not to his benefit. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=393.0s)]
*  And he changed his tune. That's really where it all comes into play. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=398.0s)]
*  I think that his way he ended on cross exam on direct, he kind of had this sort of like, you know, strong stance. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=402.0s)]
*  And I think the defense make him look shifty may have served to undercut that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=410.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINWAZlvrFQ&t=432.0s)]
