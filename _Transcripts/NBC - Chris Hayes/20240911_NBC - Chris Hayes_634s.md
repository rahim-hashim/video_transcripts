# The man who played Trump for Harris debate prep reacts to ‘remarkable’ night
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E)
*  Kamala Harris accomplished everything she needed to last night. She needed to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=0.0s)]
*  accomplish a lot. Knocked it out of the park. The vice president is known for being [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=4.32s)]
*  a politician who really prepares and it was clear that she took her debate prep [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=8.48s)]
*  very seriously. Philippe Reines is a former deputy assistant secretary of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=12.26s)]
*  state and former spokesman for Hillary Clinton. Reines played the role of Donald [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=16.68s)]
*  Trump in Clinton's debate prep back in 2016. There he is in what appears to be [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=20.84s)]
*  a kind of like a flip phone video in costume role-playing a scenario where [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=25.12s)]
*  Trump tried to hug Clinton and then chased her around the room for said hug. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=28.92s)]
*  Reines reprised the role of Trump in Kamala Harris's preparations for last [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  night's debate. Self-tenor and all and he joins me now. Philippe it's good to have [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  you. First what what do you think of that debate? I could watch it all night. I mean [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  she put on a clinic. There's really I mean there's no part of it you can watch [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=49.6s)]
*  that says that's bad. She should have redone it. It was a remarkable [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=54.7s)]
*  performance. I know the former president is saying the same thing but as usual [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=59.02s)]
*  one of them is lying and one of them is not. What so tell me take me through the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=63.18000000000001s)]
*  prep. First of all what was your approach in that prep to playing Trump and what [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=68.38s)]
*  are the kind of signature things he does in debates that you were doing and then [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=73.30000000000001s)]
*  how was that kind of gamed out and prepared for? Well first you know I my [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=77.38s)]
*  role and it is the kind of sexy part of it but I really just had to focus on the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=83.38s)]
*  left side of the screen which is him. There's a team that helps the vice [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=87.74s)]
*  president that was headed up by Karen Dunn and Rohini Kusula who I mean it was [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=91.46s)]
*  amazing and it was a frictionless team that I've you know I've worked with other [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  teams and it was great. The vice president has great people around her. I [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  mean it was not just two of them but they co-ran it. From my perspective you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=105.1s)]
*  just want the candidate to get used to what they're going to see and hear and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=110.2s)]
*  experience and there was that added oddity that they never met and what's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=116.68s)]
*  great is I had never met her. The first day that I met her I said madam [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  vice president it's nice to meet you and then 20 minutes later I was telling her [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  how she was ruining America. What was your approach? What are the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=128.72s)]
*  most important things to prepare for if you're debating Trump? Like the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  sort of go-to moves the things that might rattle someone who hasn't been in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=140.16s)]
*  the same room with them? Well I would take it a step back. I mean a debate in its [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=145.72s)]
*  ideal form is a job interview. You have two people who are going for the same [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=150.56s)]
*  position who want to put their experience and their best foot forward. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=155.28s)]
*  They want to be professional. They want to think about curveballs that might come [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=158.64s)]
*  their way and you know we've all been in that situation. The situation we haven't [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=162.8s)]
*  been in is when the other candidate for the job is six feet to your left and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=166.84s)]
*  they've got a chainsaw and the only way that they can win is by you know [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=170.4s)]
*  blooding you up and the challenge there is you know you have to make some [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=175.0s)]
*  decisions but what she did last night that was so amazing is that she [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=179.8s)]
*  wasn't just pointing out things that that might get under his skin. She was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=184.88s)]
*  making her case directly to camera to the American people. She was talking [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=190.96s)]
*  about her plans and what was also incredibly amazing is that she did [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=195.14s)]
*  something that no one else has really been able to do in the last year which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=199.05999999999997s)]
*  is remind people that this guy actually served and has a record and that record [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=202.66s)]
*  is really bad and you know you've talked about this. This amnesia issue is a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  problem where he starts out saying you know you completely screwed the border. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  It's got to be hold on pal you were there for four years you were in charge [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=218.7s)]
*  of the border and you promised us a wall and it's not there and that hasn't [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=223.02s)]
*  happened enough and it's important to lay out that case and and third I mean [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  from my own in terms of asking about prep first of all you know we all get [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=232.06s)]
*  makeup before we're on TV and the makeup artists here said you already have [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=236.86s)]
*  makeup on and I said no and she said well you've got in your forehead I can't [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=241.66000000000003s)]
*  get it off I mean it's it's so caked on the guy uses you know like plaster of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=245.38s)]
*  Paris but the thing that I noticed over the eight years and by the way I feel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=250.38s)]
*  like it was 50 years when you say a flip phone I mean it wasn't black and white [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=254.98s)]
*  Chris is that he's really he's really decompensating I mean his language has [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=258.26s)]
*  always been choppy he's always digressed there's something else going on there I [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=264.58s)]
*  think we all watch it and it's like oh he always speaks like that he does not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=270.06s)]
*  he's losing like if I lose track of my thoughts I stopped for a second when he [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=273.78s)]
*  loses track of his thoughts he just goes to another thought quickly so it doesn't [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=279.62s)]
*  sound like anything just sounds like he's jumping around that's not what he's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=284.34s)]
*  doing he's also seemingly he'll go off on Kovac for ten minutes and not say [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  Tony Fauci I mean four years ago he would go on for five minutes about Tony [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=293.5s)]
*  Fauci so there's something you know I'm in the camp that has always noticed [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=297.26s)]
*  that but just very narrowly in terms of watching everything he has said and done [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=301.78s)]
*  over the last few months and reading every word there's there's something not [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=306.34s)]
*  not right up there yeah and you know we'll only play a little selection and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  one of these selections which we'll play in a second is the sort of notorious [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=317.61999999999995s)]
*  they're eating the dogs are getting the cats which of course is both a sort of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  disgusting and racist slandered a group of people and also completely invented [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=324.82s)]
*  but that answer came he started on the rallies like that we played that rallies [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  clip he got from like people go to my rallies to that and you know he cannot [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=334.3s)]
*  follow a train of thought he interrupts himself here's just a little smattering [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=339.38s)]
*  of what that looked like she's a Marxist everybody knows she's a Marxist her [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=343.06s)]

*  of that last one he referred to it as cute and he gave a little kudos to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=374.86s)]
*  himself afterwards if he was like calling back I'm speaking moment in terms [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=379.38s)]
*  of the sort of set pieces like the baiting what how much of that was planned [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=384.02s)]
*  like it seemed to me that there were certain things that you know he won't [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  leave alone John McCain Charlottesville very fine people the outcome of the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=393.14000000000004s)]

*  get him to narcissistically obsess over them I think look you know she has seen [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=402.82000000000005s)]
*  him over the years the guys debated seven times this was the seventh general [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=411.26000000000005s)]
*  election he debated I think 11 times in the primaries notably zero times in the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=414.94s)]
*  2020 24 primaries and yet he calls everyone else for for being scared I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=420.14s)]

*  kind of watching it on TV and saying hold on dude I mean what about this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=431.58s)]
*  because that's what she was doing was calling out facts you know what's what's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=435.78s)]
*  particularly I think telling when you show these clips of his digressions or [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=438.97999999999996s)]
*  whatever you want to call them is that they make no sense so fine it he's not [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=443.9s)]

*  leave why wouldn't you say that that's not true that's very mean I'm really [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=459.34s)]
*  proud they're the biggest things what he actually starts doing is a different [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  level of insanity yes I mean you're revealing it's a subset I mean what he's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=468.94s)]
*  saying has never been truthful it has never been real it has never been [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=474.62s)]
*  normal but it is decompensating and I think because it's you know the thing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=479.14s)]
*  about the frog you know in water if you just boil them slowly they don't know [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=484.88s)]

*  and he ran for president no one thought I don't I'm concerned to how he looks [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=500.18s)]
*  Donald Trump is 78 you know if he wins we could be back in this conversation in [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=504.2s)]

*  machine to test your backhand you want to do your forehand if you want to use [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=536.52s)]
*  the ball machine as a target for your serve great it's really it's simulation [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LhJy4Qny9E&t=540.04s)]
