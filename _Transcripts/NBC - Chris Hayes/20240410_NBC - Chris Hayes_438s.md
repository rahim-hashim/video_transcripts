# Bernie Sanders slams Trump for using Israel-Hamas war to play ‘stupid politics’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ)
*  Donald Trump has a long history making anti-Semitic remarks, in particular, invoking the dual [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  loyalty stereotype, which implies Jewish Americans must care about some other loyalty they have, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=5.2s)]
*  their religion or the state of Israel and its politics, more than they care about domestic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=12.0s)]
*  issues in the U.S. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=15.6s)]
*  When he said, your prime minister, he was talking to American Jews, he's their president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=16.6s)]
*  It's been especially true in the wake of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=21.2s)]
*  Just today, the ex-president again invoked this stereotype in an attack on President Joe Biden. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=24.86s)]
*  He has abandoned Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=30.86s)]
*  He's totally abandoned Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=32.86s)]
*  And frankly, you know, he's a low IQ individual. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=34.86s)]
*  He has no idea where he is and who he's supporting. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=37.86s)]
*  He doesn't know if he's supporting the Palestinians, but he knows one thing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=40.86s)]
*  He is not supporting Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=44.86s)]
*  He has abandoned Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=46.86s)]
*  And any Jewish person that votes for a Democrat or votes for Biden should have their head examined. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=48.86s)]
*  Now, this comes at a time when Democrats, President Biden, progressives, Jewish Americans [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=53.86s)]
*  of all different stripes are engaged in intense debate over the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=57.86s)]
*  The conduct of the war under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the path forward. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=63.86s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, is one of a handful of Jewish senators who's been particularly outspoken about the crisis in Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=68.86s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=75.86s)]
*  I don't think you're going to take any head examination advice from the former president, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=77.86s)]
*  but I suspect you don't think your head needs to be examined as you've been very vocally critical of the conflict. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=81.86s)]
*  Well, it probably does, but not for the reasons that Trump articulates. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=86.86s)]
*  But that's another story. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=90.86s)]
*  Look, you have a president who is a pathological liar, who spends his life trying to divide us up in every which way, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=92.86s)]
*  who apparently has no compassion within his DNA. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=102.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'm Jewish. I'm proud to be Jewish. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=108.86s)]
*  But it doesn't matter whether you're Jewish, whether you're Christian, whether you're Muslim or whatever you are. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=110.86s)]
*  If you take a look at what is going on in Gaza today, your heart is breaking. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=115.86s)]
*  And you're looking at one of the most horrific humanitarian disasters in the modern history of this country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=121.86s)]
*  Chris, as we chat here tonight, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza are starving. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=129.86s)]
*  The New York Times documented last week, last week, that 28 children there have died of malnutrition. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=138.86s)]
*  I think that number is way, way lower than reality. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=145.86s)]
*  So we are sitting here while children are dying, starving, they're dying of malnutrition. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=149.86s)]
*  Gaza has been demolished. The housing units have been destroyed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=155.86s)]
*  1.8 million people have been taken from their homes, put on the road, not knowing where they're going, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=159.86s)]
*  living in unsafe, horrible conditions. That is the reality. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=165.86s)]
*  And it really does amaze me that people like Trump could care less, could care less, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=169.86s)]
*  that hundreds of thousands of human beings, children, are starving to death. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=176.86s)]
*  And he uses this moment for his stupid politics to tell us how much he loves Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=182.86s)]
*  who is the architect of this disastrous policy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=188.86s)]
*  I want to play for you something the president said about Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=191.86s)]
*  It's very clear that there is tension and conflict between them about this point. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=195.86s)]
*  They had a conversation the other day after the airstrike that killed the aid workers for World Central Kitchen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=199.86s)]
*  This is what, in an interview with Univision, President Biden had to say about Netanyahu. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=205.86s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=211.86s)]
*  What I will tell you is I think what he's doing is a mistake. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=213.86s)]
*  I don't agree with his approach. I think it's outrageous that those four or three vehicles were hit by drones [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=217.86s)]
*  and taken out on a highway where it wasn't like it was along the shore, it wasn't like there was a convoy moving here, etc. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=225.86s)]
*  So what I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=233.86s)]
*  allow for the next six, eight weeks total access to all food and medicine going into the country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=242.86s)]
*  What do you think of that position, Senator? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=250.86s)]
*  Well, I think the president is absolutely right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=254.86s)]
*  There's got to be a ceasefire right now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=257.86s)]
*  And there has got to be, the world has got to respond to this horrific emergency. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=259.86s)]
*  I mean, a few days ago, Biden talked to Netanyahu. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=266.86s)]
*  Apparently, he got some commitments from him to open up the borders more, to allow more humanitarian aid. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=271.86s)]
*  The New York Times just reported a few hours ago that that may not be happening or happening to any significant degree. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=278.86s)]
*  So I think the president is right. There's got to be a ceasefire. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=285.86s)]
*  The world has got to respond in a dramatic way to get food to starving people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=287.86s)]
*  It's not only food. When children are dying of malnutrition, it's not just food. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=294.86s)]
*  You need certain types of food. The medical facilities have been destroyed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=297.86s)]
*  But I'll tell you this also, Chris. We have the president is wrong. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=301.86s)]
*  You don't have to be begging Netanyahu to do anything. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=305.86s)]
*  We are supplying and have supplied Israel with huge amounts of money for decades. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=308.86s)]
*  Right now, there is legislation that would give Israel, and I voted against that legislation, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=313.86s)]
*  $10 billion more for unfettered military aid. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=318.86s)]
*  The president has got to say, sorry, Netanyahu, you are not getting one penny more until that situation in Gaza radically changes. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=322.86s)]
*  We're not begging you anymore. We're telling you. You want money? That's what you got to do. End of discussion. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=330.86s)]
*  I want to ask you about a development that's happened over the last few days and then just reported in the New York Times. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=335.86s)]
*  So obviously, for months now, they've been talking about some kind of deal, some sort of ceasefire deal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=339.86s)]
*  And obviously, of the utmost importance from the Israeli side are the hostages. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=343.86s)]
*  We don't know how many of those hostages are alive. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=347.86s)]
*  We just don't know the number. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=350.86s)]
*  And this harrowing headline today, which suggests some real complications here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=353.86s)]
*  Hamas does not have 40 hostages who meet terms of potential swap with Israel, officials said. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=358.86s)]
*  Senior Hamas officials said on Wednesday they don't have the 40 living hostages in Gaza who meet the criteria for an exchange. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=363.86s)]
*  You know, obviously, any deal has to have some reciprocity, and hostage release is one of them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=369.86s)]
*  And now you've got Hamas saying we don't have them. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=374.86s)]
*  Look, this is a nightmare on top of a nightmare. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=377.86s)]
*  I mean, I read that. Who knows? Who knows how they died, why they died? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=381.86s)]
*  But obviously, you're absolutely right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=388.86s)]
*  Our hostage exchange people now have been held under terrible conditions for months. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=391.86s)]
*  And Israel has a right to demand their release, and that has got to be part of any package. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=397.86s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time tonight. I really appreciate it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgJ5HXdlQlQ&t=402.86s)]
