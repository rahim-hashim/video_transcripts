# 'Makes my blood boil' Michael Fanone scorches GOP for whitewashing Jan. 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8)
*  Today, President Joe Biden traveled to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the site of George Washington's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=0.0s)]
*  headquarters during the Revolutionary War, to deliver his first campaign speech of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=5.12s)]
*  election year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=9.88s)]
*  The president laid out the stakes of the upcoming battle, the frame as a fight for our democracy, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=10.88s)]
*  and he invoked the violent attack on our country, led by the ex-president, three years ago tomorrow. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=15.64s)]
*  Trump's mob wasn't a peaceful protest. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=23.84s)]
*  It was a violent assault. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=26.16s)]
*  They were insurrectionists, not patriots. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=29.04s)]
*  They weren't there to uphold the Constitution. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=32.56s)]
*  They were there to destroy the Constitution. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=35.24s)]
*  Trump won't do what an American president must do. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=39.76s)]
*  He refuses to denounce political violence. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=43.08s)]
*  So hear me clearly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=47.72s)]
*  I'll say what Donald Trump won't. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=48.72s)]
*  Political violence is never, ever acceptable in the United States. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=51.72s)]
*  Political violence is never, never, never. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=55.36s)]
*  It has no place in a democracy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=58.24s)]
*  None. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=60.24s)]
*  Michael Fanone is a former Washington, D.C. Metropolitan police officer who was brutally [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=62.44s)]
*  attacked while defending the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=66.12s)]
*  He's now a council member for Courage for America, a nonprofit fighting extremism in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=69.0s)]
*  our government. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=73.56s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=74.56s)]
*  Michael, it's good to see you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=75.56s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=76.56s)]
*  I'm doing well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=77.56s)]
*  Better than our country is doing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=81.68s)]
*  And it's good to see you as well, Chris. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=83.8s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about you today as I was told that we had you and I was just [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  thinking about the strangeness and surrealness I feel in watching this event, which again, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=89.68s)]
*  I just watched on television, but covered and saw, get that everyone afterwards sort [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=95.28s)]
*  of understood, I think basically across all lines of difference in America was horrible. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=101.04s)]
*  Slowly that consensus being chipped away and the reality of what that happened being refashioned [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=106.72s)]
*  and reshaped and 25 percent of Americans think the FBI instigated it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=112.16s)]
*  And you know, a whole bunch of people think it was much to do about nothing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=117.44s)]
*  And a majority of Republicans think we should move on and not talk about it anymore. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=122.4s)]
*  And as someone who is there in the most sort of brutal part of it, just what your experience [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=126.76s)]
*  is to watch that same process happen? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=133.04s)]
*  I mean, it's it was frustrating. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=136.88s)]
*  It's you know, at times it is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=142.4s)]
*  It enrages me, you know, to see so many Americans buy into the B.S. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=149.32s)]
*  and these conspiracy theories surrounding January 6th. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=158.0s)]
*  But I mean, it also it pisses me off to see Republican lawmakers continue to spread the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=163.4s)]
*  lies and conspiracy theories regarding January 6th in an attempt to whitewash that day because [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=169.8s)]
*  it's politically inconvenient for them to acknowledge the reality of what happened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  You're someone I think who I kind of imagine I don't know what your personal politics are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=187.88s)]
*  or what they were in the past, but I kind of imagine that you just have experienced [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  firsthand people who don't think it was a big deal or do think that it was an FBI icon [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=198.2s)]
*  job or do you think it was anti-file? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=205.0s)]
*  Like, have you have you had that conversation with the person that you know? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, here we are three years just to be like, dude, I was in the FBI. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  I am telling you, like, is that a conversation you have had to had or have? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=215.72s)]
*  I've had that conversation countless times. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=223.24s)]
*  I've had the conversation as to, you know, the significance of the day and to whether or not it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=227.56s)]
*  was it was as bad as as I have described it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=234.52s)]
*  I've had the conversation trying to dispel, you know, people who I know's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=241.56s)]
*  theories or conspiracy theories regarding who was responsible for the attack on the Capitol. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=251.16s)]
*  I mean, the conversations that I've had have pretty much run the gambit when it comes to, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=259.8s)]
*  you know, the theories that are have been spread about that day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  And I, you know, I really chalk it up to the fact that you have the Republican Party who [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=272.04s)]
*  continues to spread lies to support the lies that that inspired thousands of Americans to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=277.8s)]
*  attack the United States Capitol and to assault law enforcement officers and threaten the lives [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=286.68s)]
*  of members of Congress and their staff. And I also attribute it to the Democrats, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  I guess, inability to express anger and outrage and to educate Americans [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  who may may not live within, you know, inside the beltway as to the significance of January 6th [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=317.08s)]
*  and to the threat the former president and his administration and to the Republican [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=325.72s)]
*  Party at this point, pose to America and our democracy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=331.88s)]
*  You know, I think about, you know, the former president is fundamentally he's a rich guy's son. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=336.44s)]
*  He got dropped off at prep school in a limousine, literally, and people have had to clean up for him [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=343.0s)]
*  his entire life. And you've seen people have to deal with the stuff that he does time and time [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=347.88s)]
*  again. You know, he's running for president now today. In fact, he was telling a crowd of people [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=353.64s)]
*  it was the FBI. I just think about like, what it must be like for you to watch him still out there, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=358.28s)]
*  still saying these things, you know, talking about, you know, in March, he said, let the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=364.76s)]
*  January 6 prisoners go. They were convicted or awaiting trial based on a giant lie, a radical [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=370.36s)]
*  left con job. Like to see the degree of impunity he has experienced versus what your experience [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=374.92s)]
*  of the last three years have been like. Yeah, I mean, it makes my blood boil. I mean, we've had [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  conversations, you and I, Chris, I think you can imagine, you know, the emotion that elicits from [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  myself having experienced the things that I did on that day. I mean, for those of you who don't [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=396.36s)]
*  know, you know, I was brutally attacked. I was pulled from the police line. I was beaten. I was [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  struck with a taser. I suffered a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury. And my, you know, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=410.52s)]
*  my experience that day is not unique. There were more than 100 law enforcement officers who [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=417.08s)]
*  were hospitalized, suffered injuries, some quite severe, even career ending, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=426.12s)]
*  as a result of their participation in the defense of the United States Capitol from fellow Americans. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=433.88s)]
*  Michael Fanon, it's always great to talk to you and I just have tremendous admiration [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  for you and thank you for making time tonight. Appreciate it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=450.92s)]
*  Yes, sir. Thank you for having me. All right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJHlI_scP8&t=454.28s)]
