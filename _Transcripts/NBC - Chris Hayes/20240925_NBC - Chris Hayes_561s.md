# MSNBC panel reacts to Kamala Harris exclusive interview: ‘Keeps getting better’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY)
*  With me now for reaction Vice President Harris's interview is Michael Steele former chair of the Republican National Committee co-host of the weekend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=0.0s)]
*  I know I see Michelle Goldberg opinion columnist for the New York Times and Tim O'Brien senior executive editor of Bloomberg opinion [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=6.7s)]
*  Michael let me start with you your remote there. What do you think of the interview? I [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=14.18s)]
*  Thought it was very good. I mean look [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=19.02s)]
*  You know, you just have this moment [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=21.98s)]
*  We have a presidential candidate is sitting down and saying here's what I think about what's happening in the country [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=23.68s)]
*  Here's what I'm offering to the American people and I just thought it was solid [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=31.0s)]
*  She she I love the part in the speech that she related to and sort of drove in the conversation with Stephanie [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  You know this this combo meal of I'm a capitalist who supports unions and workers [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  And that's a space we have not been in in a very very long time [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=51.88s)]
*  Where that bridge is connected where oftentimes we try to pit one side against the other [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=57.32s)]
*  She really is trying to figure out a way [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=63.76s)]
*  To create this opportunity economy around some fundamentals that translate across [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=67.46s)]
*  party [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=75.68s)]
*  You know platforms in a way that people don't get stuck on them [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=76.76s)]
*  You know I'm saying so there you don't get stuck on stupid and you [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=81.14s)]
*  Retreat to well, you know, I'm a conservative. I'm a liberal. I'm a progressive. I'm a Republican Democrat [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=84.94s)]
*  You sort of say well, how does this benefit my economy my personal economy? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=91.18s)]
*  so I think she came out strong on that one of my big takeaways Tim is that the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=95.58000000000001s)]
*  Revolution the revival of industrial policy which in some ways never went away because we have this thing called the Defense Department where we do [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=100.54s)]
*  Policy and have for a very long time spends hundreds of billions of dollars every year [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=107.64s)]
*  But the sort of revival of industrial policy both as rhetoric, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  We need you know, redundancy and supply change something she talked about with steel [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=115.58s)]
*  We need to bring manufacturing back and we're gonna use policy levers to it that that there is continuity there [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=120.36s)]
*  Right like that part of the Biden agenda, which is a huge part of it is also part of the Harris agenda [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's tied into what happened during the pandemic when we realize all of the outsourcing we have years doing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=130.2s)]
*  Put us at risk at the high end around chips and at the very basic [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=136.86s)]
*  Manufacturing level and and when she's delivering these messages now [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=142.66s)]
*  I think she keeps getting better when she talks about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  Policy of also adding a little dollop of a tweak that is going to get under Trump's skin [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=149.22s)]
*  So she not only said today that Donald Trump [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=154.1s)]
*  Talked tough against the Chinese but actually didn't deliver on anything that mattered in terms of winning that war and when she referred to manufacturing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=157.38s)]
*  She said we lost two hundred thousand manufacturing jobs [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=165.02s)]
*  Donald Trump was the world's biggest loser when it came to manufacturing and I can guarantee you that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=168.36s)]
*  Getting the biggest loser into the description of that phenomenon is going to get under his skin and she's on point and she's on [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=173.88s)]
*  Message if she's doing it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=181.4s)]
*  Consistently, you know, she sort of dropped that tweak in during interview with Stephanie when she said, you know at his very small rally [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=183.24s)]
*  You know, she's not missing these things but she's also defining herself as a pragmatist she's saying I don't want to be ideological [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  About these things. I want to find solutions that help working Americans retain jobs make more money in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  You know improve their lives embrace opportunity and it grows middle class [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=203.62s)]
*  You know that there's a sort of a term in in political discourse around, you know in polling of generic Democrat [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=209.02s)]
*  Which is like they'll always like pull a generic Democrat and and and the joke of it is the generic Democrat always does better than the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=214.98s)]
*  Individual candidate because you can just sort of project like, you know, whatever you want onto generic candidate [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=221.2s)]
*  But then when you have an actual person, you know, then it's harder that said [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  part of what I think the success of the Harris campaign has been is sort of like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=230.48s)]
*  Running as a generic Democrat and I mean that in like a good way, which is like [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=234.16s)]
*  This is kind of meat and potatoes like yeah center-left [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=238.28s)]
*  Democratic policy that she's an unstable and that's what one thing that drives why it's driven me so crazy when people say what does she stand for? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=242.61999999999998s)]
*  What is she gonna do? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=249.66s)]
*  It's been I think fairly obvious if you're paying a modicum of attention that she is going to do her best to enact as you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  Said a center-left democratic policy agenda [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=256.68s)]
*  And so for the people out there who still are kind of hazy on what her plans are [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  She has hopefully given them at least I'm not sure how much those questions are in good faith [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=265.2s)]
*  But in as much as they are in good faith, I hope that she has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=271.3s)]
*  Answered them and the other thing I'm struck by is how far actually both parties have moved from [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=275.32s)]
*  the kind in some ways [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=283.08s)]
*  Certain populist ideas have become instantiated across the political spectrum [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=285.44s)]
*  Industrial policy but really neither party at this point are kind of railing against corporate America are railing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=290.2s)]
*  I mean Donald Trump has dropped his entire [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=297.12s)]
*  Kind of you know pitchfork stick about the the elite trying to screw you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=299.74s)]
*  But the Democratic Party I think because they are so worried about being tired as radicals or socialists have also [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=305.42s)]
*  Backed off a lot of the things that they've learned that they learned from Bernie Sanders [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=312.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the intern it's interesting the sort of populist temperature if you want [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=316.24s)]
*  It's like is pretty low in her tone [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=320.38s)]
*  The only place you really saw it Michael was on the price gouging which I think is good politics, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=323.3s)]
*  She said if you are taking advantage people I'm gonna go after you and I'm not gonna make apologies and she said about [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  paying a fair share but it is not there is not a lot of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  She is not striking a populist tone [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=338.97999999999996s)]
*  I think is a fair assessment of the kind of rhetorical mode she's working in when talking about this stuff [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=341.21999999999997s)]
*  Not an absolute populist tone [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=349.06s)]
*  But I think there is a modicum of populism in it when she talks about the American worker [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, when she talks about families [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=358.24s)]
*  You know having to you know, they don't want their life to be disrupted because the car broke down [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=361.22s)]
*  Alright, so, you know, we're gonna we're gonna create an economy in which you can do two things at once that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=368.06s)]
*  Continue to work fix the car, you know pay the bills [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=375.38s)]
*  and so there that that is a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=379.42s)]
*  Form of populism that is not at the extremes but touches on what yeah Michelle was just referring to is it's something is that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=382.64s)]
*  center-left [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=390.6s)]
*  Space where you can shape it and this is what Reagan did and this is what others have done on the Republican side [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=392.6s)]
*  Before he went into Cray Cray land with Trump [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=399.44s)]
*  You know, well you you sort of find that thing that appeals across the spectrum and you make the case [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  As close to that that central point that touches someone in suburbia as well as in urban cities [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=409.22s)]
*  as well as in excerpts one of the places where I think you see that and one of the places where I think there really is a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=416.98s)]
*  ideological marker a difference from what I've seen from Biden or any actual [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=423.1s)]
*  Democratic nominee that I've covered in my career as a journalist is housing. I've never seen housing as [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  Central to a domestic policy agenda from a Democrat or in any campaign as I am this one and and you can tell Tim when [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris talks about it. This is a serious commitment like like they really think we need to bring housing cast down [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=439.58s)]
*  They really like this idea of new homeownerships new supply all that stuff because we have to absolutely no [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=446.54s)]
*  I think the crisis got so bad. You know when we talk about the whole [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=452.02s)]
*  The mystery of why inflation has such traction as this sort of red herring when there's been job growth [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=456.14s)]
*  There's been wage growth. There's GDP growth rent is a killer [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  It's because it's real the real issues affordability across a range of yet with housing being front and center [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=466.82s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=472.82s)]
*  and and housing being part of the American dream and people's idea of being able to put down a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  Financial stake in the ground and build a house and have a home for their family and they can't get there and she's a California politician [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=478.06s)]
*  This is a humongous [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=484.98s)]
*  Way, and I do think this is the space where on the substance on the politics [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=487.24s)]
*  All of it is like in the sweetest spot for a Democratic politician. Well, yeah, absolutely [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=491.8s)]
*  Although it's interesting because I don't think Donald Trump gets enough [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=496.88s)]
*  I don't think people kind of draw out the implications enough of Donald Trump constantly saying we're not gonna build apartments in your beautiful suburbs [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=500.16s)]
*  Exactly. Yes from kind of wants less housing construction and I don't think people I think that there's more [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  Democrats can do to draw out the implications of that for the housing crisis [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=515.0s)]
*  This is a place where there's a stark policy difference between these two candidates on housing vision. He has no policy [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=519.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, right. That's the other thing. He's like he's his state. He's you know, deport migrants [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=525.0s)]
*  Well is and and slap on a tariff which is actual policy [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=529.16s)]
*  He actually is going to do like that. He believes he doesn't understand pet care doesn't matter. He doesn't understand [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=532.48s)]
*  He's gonna do it Michael Steele Michelle Goldberg Tim O'Brien. Thank you've got [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  You [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDH7x2L8zY&t=544.9s)]
