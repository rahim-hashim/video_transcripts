# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU)
*  One of our favorite charts here on all in is this one. I can't get enough of it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=0.0s)]
*  It shows just how much Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has benefited from outside gifts [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=3.72s)]
*  The bar. Oh, can I see where Thomas? Oh, there he is, right? Yeah the bar all the way on the left [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=10.08s)]
*  That's it. That's Clarence Thomas all the other Supreme Court justices are just all those little little little nubs [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  Clarence Thomas has received an estimated [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=23.0s)]
*  $4 million in gifts much of which as you see between those two colors right undisclosed and disclosed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=25.0s)]
*  Almost half of which maybe 40% of which was never disclosed and that's all that we know so far by the way [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=31.96s)]
*  There may be more undisclosed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Now two Democratic senators who've been probing Thomas's gifts are asking Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate him writing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  We do not make this request lightly the evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=47.28s)]
*  Of federal ethics and false statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have complied with their federal tax obligations [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=54.56s)]
*  Presented with opportunities to resolve questions about his conduct. Justice Thomas has maintained a suspicious silence [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  One of those senators is Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=69.84s)]
*  He's chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on federal courts and he joins me now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=72.58s)]
*  Senator what what got you to this point? You have been obviously concerned with the obvious [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=78.48s)]
*  And apparent ethical lapses of this justice for a while [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=84.52s)]
*  What what brought you to this moment? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=88.44s)]
*  Really getting frustrated with the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Absence of any proper fact-finding [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=94.96s)]
*  At the Supreme Court and the refusal of Thomas through his lawyers to answer what I consider to be really basic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=97.44s)]
*  questions [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Particularly with respect to the quarter of a million dollar loan for his motor coach [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=107.36s)]
*  Which it appears no principle was ever repaid on and so the question is what took place [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=111.76s)]
*  and all his lawyers would say is that the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=119.64s)]
*  Terms of the agreement were satisfied in full [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=123.72s)]
*  Which is you will recognize or what lawyers would call weasel words that don't actually give you the facts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=126.72s)]
*  So having run up against that wall [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=133.16s)]
*  We've now asked people with real investigative authority the attorney general to look into criminal violations [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  of the disclosure laws [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  false statement potential felonies and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=146.28s)]
*  Tax violations [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  Potentially by Justice Thomas or by his donors and lenders [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  You know, I want to just stay with that third thing for a second in the case of the RV. This is the sort of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=158.6s)]
*  Land yacht RV that is it's a quarter of a million dollars [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=165.44s)]
*  He was loaned the money for it to purchase it by by a wealthy benefactor who then subsequently if I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  Understand this correctly forgave the entire loan with none of it being paid back. So essentially a gift [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  And again, I'm not a tax lawyer, but you know, I got to do my taxes like everyone else [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  if someone [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=188.76s)]
*  gives you a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=190.48s)]
*  $250,000 gift like [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=192.28s)]
*  I'm pretty sure you have to report that right? I'm like crazy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  there is a very clear and specific provision in the tax law and in the disclosure law that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  says that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=208.44s)]
*  forgiveness of a debt [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=210.16s)]
*  is income and must be declared as such and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=212.88s)]
*  This was a debt [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  He borrowed [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=219.72s)]
*  $250,000 thereabouts [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=222.12s)]
*  267,300 to be exact and he paid interest on it for a while [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  Then the interest payments stopped and our information is that no principal was ever repaid [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=229.0s)]
*  which means that in some fashion that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=233.88s)]
*  debt was either forgiven or somebody else stepped in and paid and when there were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=236.8s)]
*  No reasonable answer is coming back [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=244.0s)]
*  From Justice Thomas we just had to assume the worst [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=247.0s)]
*  And so we've turned it over for proper [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=252.04s)]
*  Investigation but undoubtedly the forgiveness of a loan very simple language anyone could understand it is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=255.56s)]
*  income for tax and disclosure purposes [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=262.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think that just seems clear Claire's a bell in terms of letter to Merrick Garland. I mean I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=265.24s)]
*  Think he's gonna blow you off [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=271.8s)]
*  If I had to guess but Merrick Garland [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=273.88s)]
*  So I guess the question is like what like where does this go and one of the thoughts I had and I don't think [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=276.6s)]
*  This is the right way to go [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=282.72s)]
*  But I just want to lay out that the holding of the majority in Trump v. US as written by John Roberts. Is that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=283.88s)]
*  Joe Biden could [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=290.6s)]
*  Could instruct the Justice Department to open a tax investigation of Clarence Thomas tomorrow and that would be fully within its constitutional power [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=292.64s)]
*  Is that how you understand the holding of that as well? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=300.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think frankly it would be [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  Even if he did it for a criminal purpose even if [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, even if he did it in order to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=312.2s)]
*  Commit some act of treason that really didn't matter that he would be protected in doing that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=315.48s)]
*  I want to call your attention because I thought you know, it's hard to think about well [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=322.88s)]
*  How does this normally work? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=327.2s)]
*  And I thought there was an interesting story out of Alaska in which a federal district judge in Alaska was accused of sexual harassment [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  There was a fact-finding undertaken by a panel of judges. There was a report issued and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=335.79999999999995s)]
*  Ultimately this judge Josh Kindred was asked to leave his post and he resigned [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  again [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=348.44s)]
*  reports of impropriety a fact-finding undertaken a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=349.96s)]
*  Report issued in a recommendation and what was striking to me read this was just all right [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=353.32s)]
*  Like it isn't anything goes for the rest of the federal judiciary. You can't just [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=357.64s)]
*  Take a quarter million dollar loan forgiven. You can't sexually harass your clerks [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  Like there is some mechanism of accountability for everyone else [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=370.12s)]
*  Your key words there were fact-finding [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=376.16s)]
*  undertaken [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=380.56s)]
*  Fast with the Supreme Court won't permit for itself [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=381.8s)]
*  They are the only nine people in all of government for whom that is true [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=384.92s)]
*  If you go to state Supreme Courts, they are overseen by panels of lower court judges [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=388.88s)]
*  When there's a legitimate ethics complaint and there is a fact-finding procedure federal district judges federal circuit court judges [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=395.16s)]
*  They all have fact-finding fact-finding is kind of the essence of process of law [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=402.94s)]
*  It's almost so basic in essence. So you don't even think about it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=409.66s)]
*  So when these judges won't answer questions about what they knew about their wife's role in insurrection activities [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=413.38s)]
*  Or when they make false statements about what was the justification for flying MAGA battle flags? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  there's no accountability to the truth and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=426.02000000000004s)]
*  Of all the people to be not accountable to the truth [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=429.38s)]
*  Supreme Court justices would seem to be the worst of all [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=434.26s)]
*  I [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=437.18s)]
*  Will just say that when we have this table of likely on this close again [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=438.3s)]
*  Just a final point on the fact-checking is just that this is the stuff we know about from reporting and other stuff [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=442.02s)]
*  But again, it's not comprehensive like we don't know what we don't know and and and it would be nice to have an actual [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=447.94s)]
*  Comprehensive accounting of what exactly is going on Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking that. Thank you very much for your time tonight, Senator [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=452.62s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  Just about everywhere you look right now climate change staring us in the face melting our faces in fact [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  Hurricane barrel that is the earliest category 5 and category 4 [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=467.78s)]
*  Atlantic hurricane on record ever in recorded history [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=472.86s)]
*  Ripped through the Caribbean last week before flooding Houston and knocking out power to millions of Texans [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=476.02s)]
*  Right now 160 million people nearly half the country are currently under some kind of heat alert [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=482.9s)]
*  Las Vegas hit 120 degrees [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=489.41999999999996s)]
*  Phoenix hit 118 [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=492.5s)]
*  Portland Oregon 102 just to be clear all three of those are all-time records for each of those cities [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=494.34s)]
*  It's hot enough to melt crayons just by leaving them in the Vegas Sun [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=501.17999999999995s)]
*  It's not gonna break until later this week [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=505.94s)]
*  Now for decades as you know conservatives and Republicans have lied about climate change. There's no other way to put it [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  They've said it's not happening or that it is happening, but it's natural or that actually know the world is cooling [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=515.5s)]
*  all kinds of nonsense [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=521.14s)]
*  Here's the thing things have finally gotten the point in the last few years [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=523.46s)]
*  Particularly like the last year or two where they just run out of room for those lies like you just can't do it [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=527.26s)]
*  Republicans cannot tell you the world is not getting hotter because it very obviously is and so now they're just trying to like [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=533.54s)]
*  Yada yada yada their way out of it [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=540.1s)]
*  That is why Donald Trump had no answer when asked about climate change at the debate [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  Former President Trump you've vowed to end your opponents climate initiatives [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=547.42s)]
*  But will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=553.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=558.02s)]
*  How close the police are to him almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=561.54s)]

*  Will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=574.0200000000001s)]
*  So I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air and we had it [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=578.58s)]
*  We had H2O we had the best numbers ever and we did [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=585.98s)]
*  We had H2O that's his response [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=591.82s)]
*  So that's why the word climate isn't even mentioned once in the Republican 2024 party platform [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=594.5400000000001s)]
*  They have no plan to combat climate change [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=599.46s)]
*  Well, that's not true. They are going to actively try to stop and sabotage the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=601.78s)]
*  Incredible progress being made right now in green energy sources. Thanks. Largely the Biden administration [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=606.94s)]
*  Look at this map from the Energy Information Administration [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=612.46s)]
*  All those yellow spots are utility scale solar units [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=615.26s)]
*  The green ones are wind all coming online by next spring in the next year [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=618.78s)]
*  New data shows that back in March wind power generation the black line here overtook coal [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=624.34s)]
*  For the very first time in history with solar that blue line not very far behind [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=630.42s)]
*  The proposed Republican Party platform says nothing about promoting green energy [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=636.1s)]
*  Just they want to drill baby drill and in project 2025 the big blueprint for actually governing [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  The priority is to oppose eyesore windmills bill to taxpayer expense [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=645.78s)]
*  support repeal of massive spending bills like the infrastructure investment in jobs and inflation reduction act that they acknowledge are providing [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=651.14s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to renewable energy developers [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=658.1800000000001s)]
*  But it gets worse [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=662.1s)]
*  Not only do they want to actively destroy this incredible growing industry [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=663.26s)]
*  Employing millions of Americans that could pull off the greatest energy transition since the Industrial Revolution [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=667.82s)]
*  Not only do they have no plan to mitigate the effects of climate change [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=672.7s)]
*  We see all around us they want to actively make it worse by undoing all climate regulations [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=676.66s)]
*  Or as project 2025 puts it the Biden administration's climate fanaticism will need a whole of government unwinding [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=682.96s)]
*  There are a few areas where it's just so starkly clear what the choices are in November and climate is one of them as we watch the world cook [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=690.72s)]
*  As we head towards the election November, I think those of us who understand the threat of a second Trump administration remain [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  Clear-eyed about where things currently stand as of today [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=706.4000000000001s)]
*  In my professional lifetime [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=710.08s)]
*  There has never been a democratic presidential candidate polling as poorly at this point in a presidential election [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=712.32s)]
*  As joe biden is right now. So that's the first point to think of right now [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  Donald trump is up more than three points in the national polling average [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=722.24s)]
*  On this day four years ago biden was up nine points in the average [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=725.52s)]
*  On july 9 2016 hillary clinton was up almost five [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=729.36s)]
*  In 2012 obama was up by two and a half versus mitt romney in 2008 [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=733.04s)]
*  He was up more than five against john mccain in 2004 john carry narrowly led [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=737.2s)]
*  Incumbent george w bush by two points. So that's on the one hand you look at that and you say [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=742.64s)]
*  Not great [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=748.48s)]
*  On the other hand, you do remember the presidencies of john carry and hillary clinton, right? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  A lot can happen between july and november [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=756.32s)]
*  And that's not to say that the polls are wrong or dismiss them [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=759.28s)]
*  I think that there's been a little bit of that. It's a little dangerous [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=762.24s)]
*  They're not perfect. They could be systematically off. I don't think the polls are wrong [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=765.84s)]
*  I think at this moment in time all the data that we have and again [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  We don't know but the data we have says joe biden is losing this race right now right now at this moment in time [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=773.6s)]
*  If the election was held today [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=778.48s)]
*  What we have to suggest don trump would win would likely be the next president [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=781.6s)]
*  But and also can't stress this enough [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  No one knows the future the future is still unwritten just ask president john carry [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=789.6s)]
*  So I don't think it is worth sinking into some kind of despair [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=795.44s)]
*  on july 9th [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  More than 100 days out from the election [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  To that point. I think it's worth looking at sunday's runoff elections in france [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=803.6s)]
*  Now you might recall if you read the international coverage of this and indeed the french coverage of this and the days leading up to that election [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=808.5600000000001s)]
*  It was kind of an absolute given that the ascendant far right would sweep out the left in the center [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=814.88s)]
*  Right-wing parties had just made massive gains in the eu parliamentary elections shortly before this vote was called [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=820.56s)]
*  And in the first round of voting in france, they have a two-round system marine le pen's hard right [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=827.36s)]
*  Neofascist national rally party. They had to change the name because the old one was so toxic [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=832.9399999999999s)]
*  Won a pretty decisive victory the best they've ever performed that party [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=837.52s)]
*  And so there was a second round of elections a runoff and ahead of that runoff it again looked as though the national rally [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=842.64s)]
*  Would win again they would romp there was this media narrative that the far right was invincible that the center and the left were helpless [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=848.4799999999999s)]
*  to stop its march [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  But then a few things happened [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  First a popular front formed in france, and I mean that literally it was a political coalition [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=859.76s)]
*  Of the center left and the far left and the center calling itself [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=865.76s)]
*  The new popular front [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  And that wasn't an accident. It is because france still has a visceral memory of fascism from the last century [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=872.24s)]
*  From the nazi occupation and the vichy government there [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=878.4s)]
*  So to see a party like the national rally whose roots date back to the worst and most dishonorable moments in french history [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=882.48s)]
*  Poised to take over the french republic activated something in the french civic consciousness [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  And the anti-fascist majority took tangible steps to block the national rally [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=895.3000000000001s)]
*  Now unlike the us france is a multi-party system and candidates there made pragmatic strategic choices to not [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=900.58s)]
*  Split the unified vote against the far right so [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=906.82s)]
*  What this meant is that in three-way races between the right the center and the left hundreds of in this case mostly centrist [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=909.94s)]
*  Candidates who are polling in third place dropped out so as to consolidate support against the national rally [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=915.94s)]
*  I love this quote one candidate who is from president emmanuel mccrone's centrist renaissance party saying something to the effect of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=922.98s)]
*  Defeats happen, but you can never recover from dishonor [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=929.86s)]
*  The people [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=935.78s)]
*  In these coalitions in the mccrone block which is centrist and the left block [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=937.22s)]
*  Don't necessarily agree with each other [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=941.86s)]
*  On policy, but they came together to say [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=943.9399999999999s)]
*  They will not pass [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=947.62s)]
*  We cannot allow this monstrously cruel dangerous far-right party with roots in the worst moments of our french history to take power [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=949.7s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=958.5s)]
*  It worked [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=960.74s)]
*  amid massive voter turnout the left and the center formed a winning coalition in fact the national rally came in a shocking third [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=962.66s)]
*  Which is how you get split screens like this? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=971.7s)]
*  Of french leftists on the left celebrating their win while right wingers watch the results in stunned [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=974.82s)]
*  sometimes teary [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=982.02s)]
*  Disappointment i've watched a lot of these videos and I could watch them all day long [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=983.86s)]
*  There really is a lesson here. Yes to be clear [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=989.3000000000001s)]
*  Very different situation from the one we were in for a bunch of reasons nature french politics multi-party democracy [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=992.9s)]
*  run-offs [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=999.22s)]
*  We got a two-party system [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1000.58s)]
*  There's not going to be runoff election or a coalition government [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1002.58s)]
*  But the thing to understand is there still is a basic coalitional element at play in this country [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1006.4200000000001s)]
*  Which is this there is an extant anti-trump majority here in these united states [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1011.94s)]
*  It has shown up time and time again [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1018.0200000000001s)]
*  The question is how can we best unite that? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1020.58s)]
*  anti-trump majority that pro-democracy majority [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1024.08s)]
*  coalition like we did in 2018 and 2020 and in 2022 [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1027.92s)]
*  Obviously part of that has to be knighting around the candidate who will be up against donald trump the democratic party candidate [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1033.3799999999999s)]
*  But that's just the beginning in some ways [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1041.6999999999998s)]
*  part of the lesson from france where a lot of people who voted [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1044.6599999999999s)]
*  Didn't necessarily love the person at the top of the coalition, right? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1049.06s)]
*  Is that what they were uniting around there and what we should be uniting around here is a deeper defense of our dearest civic values [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1053.78s)]
*  Liberty and democracy in the face of our own right-wing authoritarian monster [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1062.74s)]
*  America has a different history and legacy with fascism [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1069.9399999999998s)]
*  I will say a big chunk of the country did go a bit wobbly on it at times particularly in the late 1930s [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1074.02s)]
*  but basically [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1079.62s)]
*  From world war two onwards [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1081.3799999999999s)]
*  Our role in opposing tyranny, right? World war two and after [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1085.3799999999999s)]
*  That has been a core civic value of this country as well [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1090.5s)]
*  I do believe there's a chance that our own popular front [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1094.58s)]
*  Could once again reemerge that it wants to in the next hundred days four months [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1099.3s)]
*  And that's not to ignore the very precarious situation. We're currently in and I believe me i'm telling you this straight as I read it [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1104.26s)]
*  I don't think the polls are all wrong [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1111.54s)]
*  But we have no idea what the future will bring [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1114.58s)]
*  none [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1117.3799999999999s)]
*  And as france just showed the world there is still time lots of time to do the hard necessary work to beat back the right-wing [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQqZO6w8VU&t=1119.22s)]
