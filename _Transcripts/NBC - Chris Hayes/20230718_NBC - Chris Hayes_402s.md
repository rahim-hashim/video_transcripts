# Trump asks allies in Congress to go on offense after notice of potential indictment in Jan 6. probe
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE)
*  Just over a month ago on June 8th, Donald Trump was indicted by the special counsel Jack Smith [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=0.0s)]
*  on 37 felony counts over illegally retaining classified government documents at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=4.4s)]
*  In that investigation, lawyers for the ex-president had been told just days before [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=10.0s)]
*  that Trump was a target. Today we learned that Trump received another target letter, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=14.8s)]
*  this one for the January 6th investigation. So we are now officially on indictment watch. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=19.6s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York, is a former assistant United States attorney for the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=25.76s)]
*  Southern District of New York. He was the lead counsel in the first impeachment of the ex-president. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=29.68s)]
*  He joins me now. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you for being with us this evening. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=35.36s)]
*  You too, Ali. Let's start with your reaction to the news of Donald Trump being informed that he's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=38.56s)]
*  a target in the January 6th investigation. Not just are you a member of Congress, but you're a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=42.72s)]
*  former prosecutor. You were intimately involved with the impeachment of Donald Trump. So I'm [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=46.64s)]
*  sure no surprise to you, but it has now happened. How do you feel about it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=52.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think what we've seen over the last several months is the special counsel's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=56.88s)]
*  investigation has been really ratcheting up. They had to go to court a lot to get testimony, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=60.4s)]
*  and they were able to apparently successfully do it. And so I think this is the notice that many [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=66.64s)]
*  of us have been waiting for, that they are prepared to move forward with an indictment [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=73.52s)]
*  of Donald Trump to hold him accountable for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=77.52s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of folks who have been watching and saw what happened not only on [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=84.0s)]
*  January 6th, but in the lead up to January 6th and all of the increasingly lawless efforts [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  outlined so expertly by the January 6th committee designed to subvert democracy and overturn [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=95.52s)]
*  a lawful and proper election. And now we're going to see the fruits of both of those [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=104.88s)]
*  investigations, both the January 6th, which I think provided an important roadmap for the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=111.2s)]
*  special counsel. But the special counsel has a lot more evidentiary tools available to him [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=115.92s)]
*  than Congress does. So I expect we will see a lot of additional evidence. Tell me as a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=122.4s)]
*  former prosecutor and as a member of Congress and as counsel to the impeachment, how that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=128.32s)]
*  differs, because those of us who are paying attention heard most of the evidence, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't under oath in some cases to, you know, the way it would be if you were reporting it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=137.6s)]
*  to the FBI and they couldn't compel everybody who they wanted to testify. But what's the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=142.48s)]
*  difference fundamentally? What am I likely to hear out of this indictment that I didn't already know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  from the January 6th committee? Well, I think the biggest thing that will be different is there will [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=152.32s)]
*  be a lot more witness testimony. There were a number of witnesses who refused to cooperate [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  with the January 6th committee. Some ultimately, like Steve Bannon, were held in contempt of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=163.52s)]
*  Congress. But the grand jury process allows for the special counsel to get access to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  that information. The other important information is that we know of, and it relates also to the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  classified documents case, is that if they are able to pierce the attorney-client privilege, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=181.68s)]
*  and especially with John Eastman and his role as a quote-unquote lawyer advising Donald Trump, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=186.96s)]
*  or Rudy Giuliani for that matter, that would be pursuant to the crime fraud exception, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=193.68s)]
*  and that might be available to the special counsel, and it would not be available to Congress. So [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=199.12s)]
*  those are just a couple of examples that you will see more evidence in this indictment and in this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=204.24s)]
*  prosecution. Let's talk about the politics of this. You heard Joyce Vance saying that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=211.28s)]
*  what may happen to keep this thing tight and not subject to Donald Trump and his lawyers carrying [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=215.04s)]
*  on about the fact that he's very busy running for president so he can't be prosecuted, you may see [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  what Joyce suggested might be a less satisfying set of charges than what we expect from a sprawling [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=225.92s)]
*  investigation, something that is tight, that prosecutors can make the case about and do so [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=232.72s)]
*  in a short amount of time. What's your thought on that? Well, I'm particularly interested to see [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=237.76s)]
*  who else is charged and whether they are charged in the same indictment as Donald Trump or a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=242.72s)]
*  separate indictment because in an effort to move forward you wouldn't necessarily want to have [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=248.48s)]
*  many defendants whose defense lawyer schedules and various other issues that might arise from [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=254.96s)]
*  a multi-defendant case slow it down, but I would be very surprised if the special counsel did not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=260.08s)]
*  include all of the evidence that he believes to be sufficient to prove a charge beyond a reasonable [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=266.56s)]
*  doubt. And the issue of course is not only what Donald Trump's defense lawyers do but will also [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=274.0s)]
*  be very interesting to see what his taxpayer-funded defense lawyers, also known as House Republicans, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=281.04s)]
*  do in the coming days and weeks in response to yet another indictment of Donald Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=287.6s)]
*  Let me ask you about Matt Gaetz who says he's planning to introduce a bill to defund the special [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=294.4s)]
*  counsel's investigation. What do you understand to be the legitimacy of that sort of an effort [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  in Congress and what do you make of it? There's no legitimacy. It's a ploy. It's a charade. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=305.2s)]
*  The special counsel of course has been appointed pursuant to regulations and is properly funded [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  by the Department of Justice. This is just a continuation of House Republicans' efforts [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=321.84s)]
*  to undermine the institutions that we rely on to adhere to the rule of law. And they don't like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  that the FBI is investigating Donald Trump and others, perhaps some of their current or former [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=333.52s)]
*  colleagues. And so they rather than actually reckon with the fact that Donald Trump appears [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=338.55999999999995s)]
*  to be a serial criminal have decided that they're going to go after those trying to hold him [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=345.44s)]
*  accountable. And it is very dangerous to our democracy, to our rule of law that they continue [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=351.28s)]
*  to try to defund the police in the form of federal law enforcement in this case, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  solely for political purposes. And when we hear about political efforts to undermine the rule of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=363.11999999999995s)]
*  law from my Republican colleagues, I think they ought to look in the mirror instead of across [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  Pennsylvania Avenue. Congressman, good to see you as always. Thanks for joining us Congressman Dan [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=377.2s)]
*  Goldman. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkG2x-SYrE&t=381.36s)]
