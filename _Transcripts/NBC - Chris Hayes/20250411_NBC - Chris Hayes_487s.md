# ‘Every day is Halloween’: Kristi Noem turns DHS role into costume parade
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ)
*  As the Trump administration continues to pursue its deportation policies, Homeland Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary Kristi Noem has really taken the show on the road since her confirmation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=25.64s)]
*  Every week she appears somewhere new, posing for action scenes with border patrol or ride [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=30.6s)]
*  alongs with ICE agents, always in full costume with the latest in tactical fashion bulletproof [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=34.44s)]
*  vests and a $50,000 gold watch to boot. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=39.04s)]
*  She's been taking some heat for this particular photo op in which she is holding an assault [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=42.68s)]
*  rifle with the barrel pointed dangerously at the officer next to her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=47.68s)]
*  You don't really want to be standing there that way. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=52.16s)]
*  But if you've been paying attention, this is how she has run the department so far. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=54.76s)]
*  Like her visit to that El Salvador mega prison, posing with the men lined up shirtless behind [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=58.4s)]
*  her while she poses for the worst Rolex ad ever. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=62.58s)]
*  But as Noem is out doing dress up, her department is doing some really scary things, like apparently [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=66.0s)]
*  sending plain clothes agents to elementary schools to perform what they claim were wellness [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=71.16s)]
*  checks on undocumented students. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=75.64s)]
*  DHS officers told the schools that students' families had not given them permission for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=78.12s)]
*  the contact. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=82.16s)]
*  But according to the school's superintendent, quote, they declared the principals in both [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=83.44s)]
*  instances, the caretakers of these students have authorized them to go to the school. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=86.48s)]
*  We have confirmed that is a falsehood. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=90.3s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia is a Democrat of California who represents the two schools [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=93.32s)]
*  DHS agents went to. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=96.32s)]
*  Congresswoman Delia Ramirez is a Democrat of Illinois who's called on Secretary Noem [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=98.36s)]
*  to resign. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=101.6s)]
*  They both serve on the Homeland Security Committee and they joined me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=102.8s)]
*  Now, Congressman, let me start with you just on this reporting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=106.52s)]
*  I was really trying to make sense of the reporting as we understood it and not jump to conclusions [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=110.4s)]
*  and get out ahead of the facts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=114.44s)]
*  Maybe there was some confusion or back and forth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=116.52s)]
*  What is your understanding? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=118.24s)]
*  Is it your understanding that DHS under false pretenses lied to school officials about why [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=120.16s)]
*  they were in that building? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=127.56s)]
*  That's exactly what they did, Chris. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=130.4s)]
*  They lied. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=132.28s)]
*  They showed up at two different elementary schools here in southeast Los Angeles, wanted [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=133.28s)]
*  to speak and wanted to see the students. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=139.24s)]
*  They said they had permission to see the students from guardians, from parents. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=141.24s)]
*  It was six different students over two different schools. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=150.4s)]
*  And we also checked in with Homeland Security. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  They said that these were unaccompanied minors. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  That is also a lie. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  And so it's an incredibly concerning situation that's developing here at our schools. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=158.96s)]
*  You can imagine, Chris, that parents are terrified. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  The students don't want to go to school. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=167.3s)]
*  It's heartbreaking what is now happening. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=170.66000000000003s)]
*  They are lying to schools. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=172.62s)]
*  And I want to just commend the principals of these two schools and the staff who told [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  these agents, absolutely, you are not coming into these schools. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=179.74s)]
*  You have no signed warrant from a judge. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  We will not allow you to come into these schools. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=186.78s)]
*  And we're working right now to support these schools, the families, and I commend the superintendent [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=188.82000000000002s)]
*  of the schools for this incredible level of training that the staff received. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=194.46s)]
*  Congresswoman, as I noted in the intro, you've called for Secretary Noem to resign. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=198.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=202.9s)]
*  What this administration is, is unconscionable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=204.74s)]
*  I mean, you just heard Congressman Garcia talk about lies. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=207.18s)]
*  These are people who break laws every single day and violate due process. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=210.74s)]
*  I mean, you have the Homeland Security advisors like Tom Homan, the border czar, who says [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  in Chicago they know their rights. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  So why are you worried that you're going to violate them? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=220.74s)]
*  They have violated constantly every single day using propaganda, millions of dollars [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=223.62s)]
*  for commercials that no one authorized. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=229.5s)]
*  They have not come before the Homeland Security. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=231.34s)]
*  It's unconscionable what Noem is doing and she needs to resign immediately. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=233.82s)]
*  Can I, let me ask a follow up there because I haven't actually gotten the bottom of this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=237.66s)]
*  and maybe you know because you're on this committee, Congresswoman. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=241.1s)]
*  There's this reporting about the two, it's a 200 or $300 million ad campaign that DHS [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=244.42s)]
*  is running. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=249.26s)]
*  That's like just straight propaganda, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  It's sort of Trump propaganda. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=252.62s)]
*  It's from the budget of the agency. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=254.3s)]
*  I've seen the ads just sort of in the wild. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=256.38s)]
*  So they're definitely running them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=258.66s)]
*  Where is that money coming from? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm very confused. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=262.38s)]
*  Was that an authorized line item for something they whisked over somewhere else or was there [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=263.74s)]
*  authorized money for ads that they're using for these ads? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=271.5s)]
*  There is no $200 million authorized in the budget that Congress gave them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=272.5s)]
*  This is the problem though, Chris. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  No one from the administration has come before Homeland Security, the oversight committee [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=280.02s)]
*  of this agency to answer those questions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=286.02s)]
*  We are the members of the committee. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=289.14s)]
*  I serve in the committee of oversight accountability investigations for Homeland and we demanded [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=290.78s)]
*  on a number of occasions for her to come before us and tell us who is authorizing this propaganda [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=295.82s)]
*  money. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=301.29999999999995s)]
*  The idea that the chairman, well you know, she'll be here when she's able to come. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=302.9s)]
*  She's a little busy right now. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=307.94s)]
*  She's a little busy here spending money that no one authorized. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=309.14s)]
*  I'm thinking that she should not be spending on. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  Chris, the biggest threat to our homeland right now is Kristi Noem. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=314.66s)]
*  It's Donald Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=318.94s)]
*  It's Elon Musk, Pete Huxley and all of that crew of people who are putting the lives of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=320.34s)]
*  children at risk every day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=326.42s)]
*  I mean, you're hearing 30% down in attendance in most of our schools. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=328.78s)]
*  What do you think happens when sixth graders are afraid of going to school because this [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=333.34s)]
*  secretary of homeland is bringing a threat to their school? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=337.38s)]
*  So I just want to let me follow up on that stat. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=340.94s)]
*  The 30% of attendance down you're saying in schools and district you represent in specific [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=342.97999999999996s)]
*  schools where people are have a lot of immigrant communities. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=351.02s)]
*  I'm telling you that in schools where there's a majority immigrant community, you are seeing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=352.5s)]
*  in the upwards of 30% of attendance decline since its administration started on January [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=357.73999999999995s)]
*  20th. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=363.9s)]
*  It's all intentional. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=364.9s)]
*  Even if they don't get in, they're bringing the fear of God into the families. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  You have parents who are saying, I am worried that when I drop off my child today to the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  third grade, I will be there to ensure that they deport me in front of my child. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  And so, of course, there's fear. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  You're hearing children who are now depressed and worried about going to school because [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=383.02s)]
*  I may not see mom when I go home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  Congressman Garcia, have you heard similar from your constituents? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=393.58s)]
*  We're seeing those same numbers. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=394.82s)]
*  We have schools, by the way, where 90% of the schools are Latino, majority immigrant. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=396.7s)]
*  We're seeing serious attendance drop off, especially now in the last few weeks, especially [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=402.41999999999996s)]
*  because everything that's happening. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  And first, I want to join Congresswoman Ramirez. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  We're both on Homeland Security together. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=410.94s)]
*  Kristen Noem should absolutely resign. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  She has no business of being the secretary. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  She's playing cosplay ICE agent running around the country, going down to El Salvador to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=418.34s)]
*  prisons, holding guns, dressing up. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=423.74s)]
*  She is a joke. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4A9W9pBvUQ&t=427.38000000000005s)]
