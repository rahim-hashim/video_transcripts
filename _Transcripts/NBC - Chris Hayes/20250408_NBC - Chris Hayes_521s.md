Video Description: Michigan attorney Amir Makled was detained by federal agents on his way home from a spring break trip with his family. His only crime appears to be representing a student protestor. “We're seeing a chilling effect on not just individuals and their rights, but also on the attorneys representing these individuals,” Makled tells Chris Hayes.

# ‘They’re attacking attorneys’: Lawyer representing student protestor detained
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0)
*  They're going to keep pushing and pushing until something stops them. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=0.0s)]
*  And then yesterday we saw an absolutely chilling story out of Michigan, where immigration agents [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=4.0s)]
*  detained and demanded to search the phone of an American citizen at the Detroit airport [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=8.84s)]
*  after he returned from a vacation with his wife and two daughters. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=15.46s)]
*  His name is Amir Maqlid, and he broke no laws. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  He's a lawyer himself, and his only infraction, at least as far as we can tell in the eyes [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=22.36s)]
*  of the Trump administration, appears to be that he represents a pro-Palestinian demonstrator [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=26.46s)]
*  who was arrested at the University of Michigan last year. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=31.66s)]
*  And that attorney, Amir Maqlid, joins me now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=35.34s)]
*  Mr. Maqlid, it's great to have you on the program. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=37.86s)]
*  Just take me through, I think you were on a vacation in the Dominican Republic, you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=40.9s)]
*  land in Detroit, you got to go through customs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=46.66s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=47.66s)]
*  Well, what happens next is when I get to the immigration checkpoint and I speak to a passport [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=50.46s)]
*  officer, they ran my passport, which happens routinely whenever you're coming in through [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=55.62s)]
*  the border. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=60.3s)]
*  But the strange part is the agent looked up and looked to another government officer and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=61.3s)]
*  asked if the TTRT team was available. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=67.94s)]
*  And I didn't recognize an acronym, so I did a quick Google search while I was just standing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  at the desk there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=75.34s)]
*  And it turns out that term meant the tactical terrorism response team, which dropped my [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=76.34s)]
*  heart into my stomach. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=83.22s)]
*  I almost nearly hit the floor thinking about what the heck that could be about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=84.3s)]
*  And so I looked over at my wife and I said, honey, they're going to take me in for questioning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=87.58s)]
*  I'm pretty confident that they're going to ask me to step into an interview room. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=91.5s)]
*  And lo and behold, another agent comes out and says, sir, follow me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=95.98s)]
*  And so as I'm walking into the interview room, I asked my wife and children for you to leave. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=99.98s)]
*  And they said yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  So my wife and kids waited outside for nearly two hours while I was being interrogated by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=107.2s)]
*  Customs and Border Protection officers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  What's interesting in this situation is that as I was sitting in an interview room, a plain [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=117.5s)]
*  clothed agent who wouldn't identify himself to me asked me if I was carrying my cell phone. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  And I said yes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=129.82s)]
*  And he says, well, first off, let me just say this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=130.82s)]
*  We know who you are. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=132.54000000000002s)]
*  We know that you're an attorney. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  And we know that you represent some high profile clients. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=134.9s)]
*  And the only high profile case that I'm involved in right now is the representation of a young [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=138.32s)]
*  lady named Samantha Lewis. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=142.26s)]
*  And she's involved at the University of Michigan and was engaged in political speech and protesting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=143.54s)]
*  against the war in Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  And in our defense, we're going after the criminalization of free speech in the University [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=152.26s)]
*  of Michigan case. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=157.38s)]
*  And so we've made a lot of public remarks about that topic. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=158.84s)]
*  And we stood tall with our clients on that issue. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  So as this conversation with this agent was going, he said, listen, he has me a pamphlet, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=165.0s)]
*  federal statute on it and said, listen, we're allowed to take your phone, even if you're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=170.74s)]
*  an American citizen, and we can hold it for several days or weeks even, and then give [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  it back to you once we're done going through it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=179.78s)]
*  Or you can comply with us right now, give us the password, and let us go through it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=182.46s)]
*  And I said to them, well, guys, you already know, there's two agents in the room. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=186.74s)]
*  You already know that I'm an attorney. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  And you know that a substantial amount of my work is going to be on my phone. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  And in these days, everything's electronic anyways. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=194.62s)]
*  There's nothing left to paper filings in court. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=199.02s)]
*  I have my entire, all my emails, my text messages, all my files, my work product. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  It's all contained in my phone. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=206.5s)]
*  And so I tell them, everything that's in my phone could be considered work privilege and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  is attorney-client privilege. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=211.58s)]
*  You have no right or authority to go through the contents of my phone, especially because [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  you know I'm an attorney, and I'm not giving you that unfettered access to my phone. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=217.10000000000002s)]
*  They said, listen, we could do this two ways. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  Either we could take your phone, and you're not going to have a phone for several days, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=223.96s)]
*  or you can just give us the access. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=227.9s)]
*  I said, I'm not giving you the access when I have privileged communications on my cell [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=229.78s)]
*  phone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=234.94s)]
*  Well, that charged, you know, put him in a position where he had to go speak to his supervisor. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=235.94s)]
*  He comes back several minutes later and says, why don't you write down, he gave me a legal [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  pad, why don't you write down what it is that you feel is privileged, and we won't go through [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=243.5s)]
*  that stuff. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=248.06s)]
*  We'll go through everything else. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=249.06s)]
*  I said, what kind of a futile exercise would that be? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=250.06s)]
*  I've got to go through what, nearly 15 years of communications and emails and files to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=253.38s)]
*  say this is privileged and this isn't. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  I said, that's ridiculous. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=260.9s)]
*  It's an impossibility to go through all that stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=262.42s)]
*  So we came after, I mean, this is going on for nearly an hour and a half. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=264.7s)]
*  We came to the final pass. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=269.0s)]
*  He said, listen, again, if you want to leave here with your phone, you're going to have [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=270.38s)]
*  to give us access. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=274.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=275.58s)]
*  And so they asked me, why don't you just show us the context in your phone? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=276.58s)]
*  They wanted to know who my contacts were. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  They wanted to do a data dump of all the contacts in my phone. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=282.62s)]
*  And I said, well, and he said, do you believe that that's privileged information? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=285.94s)]
*  I said, it very well could be, but I don't want you to take my phone away from me either. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=290.02s)]
*  So I agreed to let them see my contacts only. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=294.42s)]
*  And so once they did that, they came back and wanted to question, they gave me a list [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=297.9s)]
*  about five or six names of contacts that were on my phone and wanted to know how I was associated [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=301.94s)]
*  with these folks, what's my relationship to them, where did I meet them, how did I know [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=306.62s)]
*  them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=311.22s)]
*  Now you're getting too far. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=312.94000000000005s)]
*  Everybody that's in my phone is either going to be a family member, a friend, or a client. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=314.26000000000005s)]
*  And that's the only information I'm going to give you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=318.74s)]
*  And to me... [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=320.86s)]
*  Let me just, just for one second, one, did they say who they were? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=321.86s)]
*  Was it Customs and Border Patrol? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  Did they say who they were? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=329.1s)]
*  And did they give you a top line up the front who said, we've pulled you aside because of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=330.74s)]
*  X? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=334.94000000000005s)]
*  Well, they wouldn't tell me why they stopped me. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=335.94000000000005s)]
*  They did tell me and they were prepared. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=340.22s)]
*  So it wasn't random. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=342.82000000000005s)]
*  This is not something where I was just randomly selected. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  They knew who I was. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=346.38000000000005s)]
*  They knew my history. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=347.42s)]
*  They knew I had represented high profile cases. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=348.42s)]
*  They told me we looked you up and they were ready to ask me pointed questions about certain [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=351.38000000000005s)]
*  things. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  And because he brought up the high profile case, it led me to believe that they're targeting [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  me specifically because I've taken up the defense for this young lady, Ms. Samantha [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=362.16s)]
*  Lewis. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  To me, I was really appalled by that apparent overreach of the government at this point. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=368.04s)]
*  And they were Customs and Border Protection agents just wearing plain clothes. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  He showed me a badge, but he wouldn't tell me his name. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=378.2s)]
*  And, I mean, we should be clear here that like the normal sort of, you know, sort of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=380.6s)]
*  protocol of rights are different at the border, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=388.92s)]
*  They can sort of ask anyone anything they want essentially at the border. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=392.92s)]
*  Had you ever had an interaction like this before where you had a question but ever had [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=398.56s)]
*  anyone in law enforcement like mention your clients as like the possible motive? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  I've never been interviewed at the border. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=411.0s)]
*  I've gone and traveled and they knew that I've traveled extensively outside of the country. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  And I just as of recent as December on Christmas break, we took another family trip to Mexico. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=418.16s)]
*  I came back and nobody stopped us. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=422.92s)]
*  But that was not during the Trump administration. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=424.84s)]

*  We now have a new administration who's made it very clear that they're going to attack [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=429.26s)]
*  attorneys who are taking on, you know, cases that are against the interests of what this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=433.52s)]
*  current administration believes in. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=440.08s)]

*  immigration lawyer, but it's disturbing that they want to sanction immigration attorneys [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=446.54s)]
*  for cases that they would deem to be frivolous if they're helping people who are seeking [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=451.2s)]
*  asylum or attacking those D.C. law firms and the executive orders. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, so we're seeing a chilling effect on not just individuals and their rights, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  but also on the attorneys representing these individuals. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=466.48s)]
*  Yeah, and I just want to be clear here. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=468.59999999999997s)]

*  front of mine, Amir Maklad, who's an attorney in Detroit who was questioned at length in [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=486.67999999999995s)]
*  part about the clients he represents, an American citizen. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=492.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time tonight, sir. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4af7FJNiFy0&t=496.59999999999997s)]
