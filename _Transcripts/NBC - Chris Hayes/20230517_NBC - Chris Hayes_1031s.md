# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 16
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI)
*  Everyone agreed that that was the case. A default would be a disaster for the American people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=0.0s)]
*  It would trigger a job-killing recession. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=7.0s)]
*  A default would crash the stock market and hurt the retirement security for millions of older Americans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=10.0s)]
*  And a default would dramatically increase costs on people all across the country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=17.0s)]
*  And it was a very positive development that everyone agrees. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=22.0s)]
*  Today was another day of debt-sealing brinksmanship as Republicans continued to hold the economy hostage [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=27.0s)]
*  in return for spending cuts that would slash government services. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=33.0s)]
*  While congressional leaders sounded optimistic about reaching a deal, the clock is ticking. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=37.0s)]
*  June 1st is the deadline, which is fast approaching. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=42.0s)]
*  If no agreement is reached before then, the U.S. would then run the risk of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=45.0s)]
*  disfaulting on its debt for the first time in history. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=48.0s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat of Massachusetts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=51.0s)]
*  She's chair of the banking subcommittee on economic policy, member of the finance committee, and she joins me now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=54.0s)]
*  Senator, maybe first I'll start with just your understanding of where things stand right now in this back and forth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=60.0s)]
*  Well, that we've got a hostage taker who is saying that he is willing to blow up the economy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=68.0s)]
*  and put millions of people out of work if he, Kevin McCarthy, and the House Republicans [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=76.0s)]
*  don't get to make a lot of very painful cuts in the budget. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=83.0s)]
*  And he claims to be physically responsible, care about the increasing national debt. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=88.0s)]
*  And yet, every time the president and other Democrats like me talk about bringing in more revenue [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=94.0s)]
*  as a way to reduce the national debt, he says, no, can't possibly do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=103.0s)]
*  So while this fight plays out in this moment of we've got someone that's willing to take a hostage, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=110.0s)]
*  that's willing to do a lot of damage to our economy, that's willing to destroy our good name around the world, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=118.0s)]
*  that they claim that it's for fiscal responsibility. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=124.0s)]
*  But this is really just a fight about our values. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=128.0s)]
*  And Kevin McCarthy has made clear that we must at all costs protect every billionaire, every billionaire corporation, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=132.0s)]
*  every loophole in the tax code. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=141.0s)]
*  And if that drives the national debt up, OK, by him, while Democrats are saying, we've already incurred this debt, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=144.0s)]
*  let's raise the national, raise the debt ceiling and go on and have ordinary budget negotiations. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=152.0s)]
*  So really from very different angles on this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was some reporting that the White House team had a list of loopholes to close as revenue. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=162.0s)]
*  Those were rejected out of hand. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=168.0s)]
*  There's also this I think an interesting thing I'd like to get. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=170.0s)]
*  I'm going to play you some of your colleague, John Fetterman said one of the red lines as enunciated by McCarthy [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=172.0s)]
*  is work requirements for a few different government programs, including possibly Medicaid, it's unclear, TANF, Food Stamp, SNAP. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=177.0s)]
*  Right. So these are three government programs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=184.0s)]
*  Now, from a budgetary standpoint, this would not save a lot of money. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=186.0s)]
*  So that even if you're talking about this, this is an ideological pursuit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=189.0s)]
*  Here's what your colleague, John Fetterman, had to say about SNAP, food, supplemental nutritional assistance program and work requirements. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=192.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=200.0s)]
*  The Republicans want to give a work requirement for SNAP, you know, for a hungry family has to have these this kind of penalties. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=201.0s)]
*  Are they some kinds of word working required? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=212.0s)]
*  Shouldn't you have a working requirement after we sell your bank with billions of your bank? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=215.0s)]
*  That's him asking a bill. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=220.0s)]
*  I'm John Fetterman, bank CEO about work requirements for bailed out banks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=223.0s)]
*  My suspicion, though, is that you would have the same view of anything like work requirements on Medicaid or SNAP, particularly. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=227.0s)]
*  Well, you know, actually, this thing is even worse than it sounds. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=233.0s)]
*  You realize that more than 90 percent of the people who currently receive help through Medicaid either have a job or they have a disability or they have a little tiny baby at home that they're trying to take care of. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=238.0s)]
*  In other words, they're already slotted in the current system as either working or not eligible to work. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=254.0s)]
*  So you have to ask yourself, what are the work requirements really about? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=263.0s)]
*  And I want to be clear. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=267.0s)]
*  They are not about more people going to work. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=268.0s)]
*  What they're about is loading a whole lot more red tape into the system so that many of the folks will get themselves tangled up and then lose access to benefits they are fully eligible for under the rules. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=271.0s)]
*  But they get tossed out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=288.0s)]
*  That could be a twofer for the Republicans. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=290.0s)]
*  It could save them a little money when they knock people out, and it could cause a lot of pain to a lot of people who are doing their best to try to hold it together for themselves and their families, because that's who the Republicans are. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=293.0s)]
*  Well, speaking of someone who's not in a lot of pain, though, has caused a significant amount of it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=307.0s)]
*  You had the Silicon Valley Bank CEO Gregory Becker in front of your committee today. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=311.0s)]
*  I've been sort of astonished by the interviews he's given afterwards. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=317.0s)]
*  It seems clear that he screwed up. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=321.0s)]
*  They all screwed up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=323.0s)]
*  They made a bunch of bad bets. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=324.0s)]
*  I mean, again, this happens. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=325.0s)]
*  I mean, people make bad business decisions. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=327.0s)]
*  They made bad ones. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=329.0s)]
*  They didn't think interest rates were going to go up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=330.0s)]
*  They had too many insured depositors. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=332.0s)]
*  They had a bank run. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=333.0s)]
*  You know, I want to play this exchange about his compensation back and forth today and what he plans to do with the many millions of dollars he got while making these very bad bets. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=334.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=345.0s)]
*  The collapse of your bank cost the FDIC fund about $20 billion, money that someone is going to have to make up. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=346.0s)]
*  How much of the $40 million that you earned from loading up SVB Bank with risk are you planning to return to the FDIC? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=357.0s)]
*  Senator, I promise to cooperate with the regulators as they do. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=369.0s)]
*  Are you planning to return a single nickel to what you cost the fund? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=373.0s)]
*  Senator, I know there's going to be a process review of compensation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=377.0s)]
*  I'll take that as a no. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=382.0s)]
*  I took that as a no as well. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=383.0s)]
*  Do you think that money should be clawed back? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=386.0s)]
*  You bet I think that money should be clawed back. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=388.0s)]
*  And here's the good news. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=391.0s)]
*  I'm not the only one. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=392.0s)]
*  So we've got a bunch of Democrats and a bunch of Republicans who think that money should be clawed back. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=394.0s)]
*  We've introduced we are introducing a clawback bill that will basically say to these corporate executives that when you load a bank up with risk and then give yourself these gargantuan bonuses, stock options, and then the bank blows up, you don't get to keep the money. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=400.0s)]
*  Because the only way we're going to get them off this idea that the cool thing to do in banking is take a lot of risk and pay yourself a lot of money is to say when you blow up your banks, you're going to lose that money. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=423.0s)]
*  So I've got a bipartisan bill. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=438.0s)]
*  We're going to be introducing it in just the next couple of days. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=440.0s)]
*  We're putting the finishing touches on it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=444.0s)]
*  I want to get it through the banking committee. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=447.0s)]
*  I'm going to ask for a markup on it and take it to the floor of the Senate and get a vote. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=449.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's one of the biggest bank failures in American history. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=453.0s)]
*  I think probably you shouldn't walk away at 40 mil. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=457.0s)]
*  Just me, Senator Elizabeth Warren, not just me, a lot of other people. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=459.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=462.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=463.0s)]
*  Billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter back in October. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=465.0s)]
*  It's a microblogging site. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=468.0s)]
*  I like it a lot, but like, let's just OK. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=470.0s)]
*  He bought it for a whopping $44 billion. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=472.0s)]
*  It's a private company now, so we don't know what its business internals look like. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=475.0s)]
*  But by all accounts, advertisers have absolutely fled. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=478.0s)]
*  His new subscriber service doesn't look like it's doing very well. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=482.0s)]
*  People think the company is worth way less than what he bought it for. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=485.0s)]
*  So he desperately needs someone new to bring in revenue. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=488.0s)]
*  And it is against that backdrop that Musk is preparing to usher in a new CEO. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=492.0s)]
*  Her name is Linda Jacarino. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=496.0s)]
*  She's a veteran of the advertising business until a few days ago. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=498.0s)]
*  She was actually the advertising chief at NBC. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=501.0s)]
*  She's going to have a workout for her. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=504.0s)]
*  This is what the current state of Twitter is right now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=506.0s)]
*  As Ben Collins reported, if you search for cats or dogs on Twitter a few days ago, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=508.0s)]
*  you got animal torture videos, because apparently Twitter had screwed up the code [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=512.0s)]
*  that would have stopped that stuff from surfacing, and instead they were surfacing it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=517.0s)]
*  And then there's the guy who runs the website who really likes to tweet. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=520.0s)]
*  One of the richest men in the world who's basically like thumbs-upping and responding [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=524.0s)]
*  to just about every offensive, racist, right-wing meme he sees on the website. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=527.0s)]
*  Last night he compared George Soros to the most infamous Jewish villain in comic book history, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=532.0s)]
*  saying that Soros hates humanity. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=537.0s)]
*  The Anti-Defamation League called the tweet dangerous. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=540.0s)]
*  Israel's foreign ministry accused Musk of stoking anti-Semitism on his platform. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=542.0s)]
*  Tonight, Musk defended his comments in an extensive, painful interview on CNBC. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=547.0s)]
*  You tweeted this thing about George Soros. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=554.0s)]
*  I'm looking for it because I want to make sure I quote it properly. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=557.0s)]
*  I mean, you know what you wrote, but you basically... [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=560.0s)]
*  I said it reminds me of my NATO. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=562.0s)]
*  This is like, calm down, people. This is not like made a pivotal case out of it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=564.0s)]
*  You said he wants to erode the very fabric of civilization and Soros hates humanity. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=567.0s)]
*  When you do something like that, do you think about... [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. That's my opinion. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=575.0s)]
*  Do your tweets hurt the company? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=577.0s)]
*  Are there Tesla owners who say, I don't agree with his political position, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=579.0s)]
*  and I know it because he shares so much of it? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=582.0s)]
*  Or are there advertisers on Twitter that Linda Iaccarina will come and say, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=585.0s)]
*  you got to stop, man, or I can't get these ads because of some of the things you tweet? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=588.0s)]
*  You know, I'm reminded of... [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=605.0s)]
*  the scene in The Princess Bride, great movie. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=612.0s)]
*  Great movie. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=615.0s)]
*  Where he confronts the person who killed his father. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=617.0s)]
*  And he says... [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=622.0s)]
*  Offer me money. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=628.0s)]
*  Offer me power. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=631.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=633.0s)]
*  So you just don't care? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=637.0s)]
*  You want to share what you have to say? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=641.0s)]
*  I'll say what I want to say, and if... [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=643.0s)]
*  the consequence of that is losing money, so be it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=647.0s)]
*  Joined now by NBC News senior reporter Ben Collins, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=650.0s)]
*  who wrote about the grotesque cat search issue on Twitter, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=652.0s)]
*  and Michelle Goldberg, whose latest op-ed of the New York Times [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=655.0s)]
*  focused on the influence of Christian nationalism. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=658.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that was like him making himself out to be way more heroic than he is. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=662.0s)]
*  Like, I don't care about money, I don't care about power, I just care about, like, posting. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=667.0s)]
*  But it's like... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=672.0s)]
*  Well, there is part of that that's true, though, right? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=673.0s)]
*  And he has spent this enormous amount of money... [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=675.0s)]
*  I mean, billions of dollars to post. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=678.0s)]
*  Right. And posting is clearly his life's passion. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=680.0s)]
*  That's what he wants to do. He wants to post. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=683.0s)]
*  Right. He just does it all day long. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=685.0s)]
*  Which I find relatable, but that's another story. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=687.0s)]
*  Yes, but he is doing it no matter... and he's burning through billions of dollars to post. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=692.0s)]
*  And he exists as both... I mean, you both shouldn't be on Twitter because Elon Musk owns it, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=696.0s)]
*  but also Elon Musk is the incarnation of why you shouldn't be on Twitter, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=701.0s)]
*  because he shows you every day what Twitter does to someone's brain. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=705.0s)]
*  Right? I mean, you just have seen... [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=709.0s)]
*  He's the cautionary tale. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=711.0s)]
*  Right. You watch this person kind of be radicalized and red-pilled in real time. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=712.0s)]
*  As every trollish conspiracy theory, he just mainlines and then regurgitates it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=716.0s)]
*  It's like when you go to a candle shop and the candles look so beautiful and pristine, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=722.0s)]
*  and then like when it's like melted down and it's like dripping. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=726.0s)]
*  It's like that's the before and after. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the other thing we should note about this is that a big talking point on the right right now is, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=731.0s)]
*  look, Twitter just got rid of 90% of its staff and it operates just the same. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=736.0s)]
*  And by the way, no, it does not. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=739.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=741.0s)]
*  You are searching for the word cat, and you get a cat literally inside of a blender being blended to death. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=742.0s)]
*  Don't want to talk about that on TV, but that is what's going on. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=747.0s)]
*  And that's because he ripped out the wires that would have made that happen, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=750.0s)]
*  and he eliminated the staff that would have checked. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=755.0s)]
*  This was there. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=757.0s)]
*  I talked to the guy who used to run this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=758.0s)]
*  He said there were multiple layers of redundancy that would prevent snuff films from appearing on this website. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=760.0s)]
*  And now they're gone. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=764.0s)]
*  And look, this guy is going through what a lot of people did during the pandemic. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=766.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=771.0s)]
*  We all know somebody who kind of like lost it because they were like deep on the air. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=772.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the way in. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=776.0s)]
*  And like they were previously kind of normal or they were a little bit funky and then they lost it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=778.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=781.0s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=782.0s)]
*  I'm just wondering how long – [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=783.0s)]
*  Like we're watching it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=784.0s)]
*  Yes, we're having it in real time. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=785.0s)]
*  I'm just wondering how long like Titans of Industry and people who are trying to do business with this guy [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=786.0s)]
*  and his other ventures are going to put up with this stuff. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=791.0s)]
*  I mean, there's something more than though – so it's also like he's – first of all, he's just like not – [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=793.0s)]
*  he's like the least entertaining poster ever. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=797.0s)]
*  He's not funny or witty. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=799.0s)]
*  There's nothing sort of clever or interesting. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=800.0s)]
*  He doesn't have any like innate talent for it and yet desperately wants to be it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=801.0s)]
*  Well, that's the pathos of it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=805.0s)]
*  That is the thing. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=806.0s)]
*  It's really – it's intense levels of pathos wrapped up in this. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=807.0s)]
*  But the other thing is like he's just saying, you know, there's a shooting in Allen, Texas. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=810.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=814.0s)]
*  And Bellingcat, a really interesting journalistic outfit that does sort of open source research, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=815.0s)]
*  located the profile for the shooter. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=821.0s)]
*  He was very clearly an avowed white supremacist Nazi. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=824.0s)]
*  He had a Latino surname, but those two things are not incommensurate. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=829.0s)]
*  They can coexist. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=832.0s)]
*  And, you know, Elon Musk calls it into question as like a Psyop when Paul Pelosi is attacked. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=834.0s)]
*  You know, he posts this like disgusting fabricated conspiracy theories. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=842.0s)]
*  Like that part of it is like forget what his bad views are. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=846.0s)]
*  Like he is mainlining like false things. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=849.0s)]
*  Right. And I think more than that, I mean, I believe he shadow banned Bellingcat. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=852.0s)]
*  And so I think what you see with him, you know – [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=855.0s)]
*  Like made it harder to get to their stuff on Twitter. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=858.0s)]
*  Right. Which kind of was the big right-wing argument about why Twitter was violating the First Amendment before Elon Musk took over. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=860.0s)]
*  I think that all of this is of a piece. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=866.0s)]
*  You see, for example, what Elon Musk has done in Turkey where he, you know, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=868.0s)]
*  acceded to the Erdogan government's demands that Twitter take down, you know, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=872.0s)]
*  kind of content about the opposition content. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=877.0s)]
*  So he is basically he is the, you know, kind of he turned Twitter into on many different fronts a vehicle for authoritarianism, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=881.0s)]
*  both, you know, kind of spouting authoritarian content and tamping down on content that would challenge authoritarianism. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=891.0s)]
*  In terms of the advertising, I mean, they are an advertising company. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=898.0s)]
*  They have been to the extent they were ever profitable. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=902.0s)]
*  It just seems like you're not like – what are you going to do? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=905.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? Put your tweets next to him saying George Soros is a big comic book Jew villain? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=907.0s)]
*  That's basically what he's saying. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=914.0s)]
*  And look, Chris, over the last few years I've had to go to the worst websites in the world every day. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=916.0s)]
*  At H&M when I was in its thing, 4chan. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=920.0s)]
*  I don't think I dread going to a site more than I dread going to Twitter every day [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=922.0s)]
*  because you see that the dumbest stuff is underneath smart people. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=925.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=928.0s)]
*  It's not, you know, with 4chan, if you saw something enlightening, you would be shocked. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=929.0s)]
*  It was like a nice thing to happen. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=932.0s)]
*  With this, you are just constantly disappointed by the concept of the website. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=934.0s)]
*  And that is – I don't know how long this is going to last. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=938.0s)]
*  At some point people are going to look up and be like, wait, I don't have to do this. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=941.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=943.0s)]
*  There are other ways to spend my time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=944.0s)]
*  Well, in terms of how people spend their time, like that's not how it's being monetized anyway. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=945.0s)]
*  What they have to do is sell ads, right? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=949.0s)]
*  So like, Lindy Ocarino, who, you know, by all accounts is very good at her job [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=951.0s)]
*  and has connections in the advertising industry, also has politics that much more align with Donald Trump or Elon Musk [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=955.0s)]
*  than, you know, folks on the other side of the aisle. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=960.0s)]
*  Like, she could be the best at the world. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=963.0s)]
*  But what brand, who, is going to purchase to like put it next to, you know, Elon Musk's latest rant? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=965.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, first of all, I won't – I don't know. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=972.0s)]
*  I will say that I have seen some brands, you know, small brands advertising on Twitter, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=975.0s)]
*  one that I was actually had thought that I was going to buy something from. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=980.0s)]
*  And then I said, oh, they're on here. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=984.0s)]
*  They must be sketchy and weird. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=986.0s)]
*  That's exactly the association that everybody is looking for. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=987.0s)]
*  It's a weird trinket website now, basically. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=990.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=992.0s)]
*  You see stuff in the middle of the mall that, you know, those like weird drone things and like candles. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=993.0s)]
*  It's a huge part of the segment. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=998.0s)]
*  Candles. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=999.0s)]
*  That's what they sell on Twitter now. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=1000.0s)]
*  I don't know how you can make $44 million back. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=1001.0s)]
*  When you're worth hundreds of billions of dollars, you can burn a lot of it, it turns out. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=1004.0s)]
*  Ben Collins and Michelle Goldberg, thank you very much. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=1008.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqVnUOVMoI&t=1022.0s)]
