# ‘Bonkers’ Trump team aims to suppress vote rather than earn it
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U)
*  On one level, you could say Donald Trump's relationship to democracy and self-governance [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=0.0s)]
*  seems pretty straightforward. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=3.86s)]
*  He doesn't care about them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=4.86s)]
*  It's because he doesn't like to lose, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  He's lost a democratic election. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=9.42s)]
*  He's desperate for criminal immunity. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=11.06s)]
*  So it's sort of instrumental for him. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=12.86s)]
*  No democracy, no losing, no problem. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=15.02s)]
*  I think it's actually deeper than that, deeper than a kind of instrumental, well, whatever [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=17.86s)]
*  works best. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  I think opposing democracy isn't just convenient for him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  It's actually a fixed, strongly held ideological belief. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=25.76s)]
*  You can see that all the time in his constant praise of dictators. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  It's good to have a good relationship with Putin and Xi and all these people that have [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=33.86s)]
*  lots of nuclear weapons. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=38.7s)]
*  And Kim Jong-un had a good relationship with. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  He's a tough, smart guy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  Tough smart guys. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=45.02s)]
*  He always says that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=46.02s)]
*  He had a word bond the other day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=47.02s)]
*  He says he's the boss. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=48.02s)]
*  When he says he goes, he likes it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=49.02s)]
*  He likes the idea of a strong man who's tough with his people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=50.02s)]
*  He prefers dictatorship to democracy as a fixed principle and not just on day one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=52.9s)]
*  But again, still, that's all very rhetorical. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  If you want an incredible example of this antagonism to democracy in practice, just [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  look at what's going on at the Republican National Committee, where Trump is a presumptive [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=65.88s)]
*  nominee is purging the party and remaking it in his image. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=70.6s)]
*  Now, actual Republican election experts have been at odds with Trump for years because [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=75.0s)]
*  he tells Republican voters and Trump voters that mail in voting is rigged. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=80.56s)]
*  Remember this, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  Spent months saying it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  Remember back in November 2020, after Joe Biden won and Donald Trump denied the result, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=87.10000000000001s)]
*  there were still those two critical Senate runoff elections in Georgia that would determine [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=91.5s)]
*  party control of the Senate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=96.26s)]
*  And RNC chairwoman, Rhonda, Ronnie McDaniel was confronted with the real world effect [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=97.84s)]
*  of Trump's election lies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  Machines are switching the votes and we go there in crazy numbers and they should have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=105.46s)]
*  won, but then it's still... [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=111.72s)]
*  Yeah, we have to, we didn't see that in the audit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=113.72s)]
*  So we've got to just, that evidence I haven't seen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=116.22s)]
*  So we'll wait and see on that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  How are we going to give money and work when it's already decided? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  It's not decided. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=126.32s)]
*  This is the key. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=127.32s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=128.32s)]
*  It's not decided. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=129.32s)]
*  If you lose your faith and you don't vote, people walk away, that will decide it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=130.32s)]
*  It's not rigged. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=136.18s)]
*  I promise you, please vote. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=137.18s)]
*  Remember Democrats swept both of those Senate seats? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=139.18s)]
*  So the RNC realized they had a problem on their hand. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=141.9s)]
*  This bizarre vendetta Trump had against, specifically against mail-in voting, which wasn't what [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=144.04s)]
*  the gentleman there was referencing, but mail-in voting in particular was really hurting them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=148.9s)]
*  Because as Rhonda McDaniel tried in vain to tell those Georgia Republicans, mail-in validating [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=153.4s)]
*  is an incredibly useful way to bank votes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=157.66s)]
*  You never know what's going to happen on election day. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=160.82s)]
*  You certainly don't want to wait for the last second and then, I don't know, there's a blizzard [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=162.76s)]
*  and the weather's bad, or there's an emergency, or voters get out of work before, can't get [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=165.76s)]
*  out of work before the polls close. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=170.8s)]
*  Not only that, but this is crucial. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=172.84s)]
*  As a major party organizer, if you bank those votes early, if the people that you know are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=174.76s)]
*  voting for you vote early, then you have a smaller, what's called voter universe to deal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  with on election day to go contact those voters and turn them out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=183.68s)]
*  It is an efficient way to campaign democratically. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=186.42s)]
*  It's just smart, good tactics, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=189.1s)]
*  It's not a partisan or ideological issue at all, which is why after the 2020 debacle, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=191.22s)]
*  the RNC launched the Bank Your Vote campaign to, as they put it, get our voters to vote [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=197.6s)]
*  by mail or early in person and ballot harvest where permitted. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=203.38s)]
*  All things the last Republican president said were corrupt and fraudulent, wrongly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=208.14s)]
*  But now, Donald Trump could be the next Republican president and his people have taken over the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=213.32s)]
*  RNC and guess what he's doing as part of his remodeling over the RNC? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=217.42s)]
*  The much-heralded Bank Your Vote program, aimed at getting Republicans to vote early, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=222.28s)]
*  will shift to a Grow the Vote program focused more on expanding the party's outreach to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=226.7s)]
*  less likely Trump voters, according to the Washington Post, which, okay, voter outreach [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  is good, I guess, but also, this is key, Trump's top campaign aide at the RNC also installed [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=235.5s)]
*  Christina Bob, a former OAN reporter and an ardent 2020 election denier, as, listen for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=242.3s)]
*  the title, Senior Counsel for Election Integrity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=248.96s)]
*  So to recap here, instead of making Republicans comfortable with early mail-in voting, they're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=254.68s)]
*  killing that idea and with the naming of Bob's the senior role, appear to be going all in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  on election integrity, which means suing election officials and challenging voter access. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=264.36s)]
*  The new institutional ethos is less Party of Lincoln and more My Pillow Guy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=270.74s)]
*  People say, well, let's be like the Democrats and vote early and ballot harvest and all [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=275.82000000000005s)]
*  this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=281.98s)]
*  No, you lose your country. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=282.98s)]
*  That's where all the crime is, is in the early voting and stuff. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=283.98s)]
*  No, that's nuts. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=288.42s)]
*  You're wrong. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=290.14000000000004s)]
*  But that's what Donald Trump wants. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  Remember, he was complaining about the election being rigged ad nauseum before he even lost [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  it in 2020. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  And here's the party he now runs, making an affirmative choice backed up by money and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  manpower and logistics, a choice to put their effort into trying to suppress the vote, election [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  integrity, stop people from voting, putting up hurdles rather than the effort they had [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=311.24s)]
*  in place to just straightforwardly win more votes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=316.4s)]
*  Make it easier for your people to vote. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=322.12s)]
*  That's what they're committed to. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=324.64s)]
*  Because Donald Trump hates the idea of people choosing their leader. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=327.2s)]
*  He would prefer it if the leader could choose his people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=331.5s)]
*  It's really one of his few deeply held core beliefs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0yZQxIF0U&t=335.9s)]
