# ‘Did he cheat on Melania?’: Trump trial highlights new text messages
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg)
*  Joining me now are two people who are at the courthouse today, former federal prosecutor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=0.0s)]
*  Harry Lippman and MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Okay, a lot to get to today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=6.8s)]
*  Let's sort of start where I ended on Keith Davidson, who's sort of an important substantive [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=9.56s)]
*  witness. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=15.24s)]
*  Tell us who Davidson is and what he was going through today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  Davidson is the lawyer for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=20.04s)]
*  And so prosecutors were taking him through the negotiation of the settlement payments [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  which Chris, as you know, operated very differently. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=27.98s)]
*  The first one, AMI handled. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  The second one, David Pecker already testified. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=32.84s)]
*  He's told Dylan Howard, do not get involved in this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=35.5s)]
*  I do not want any affiliation with the porn star. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=38.78s)]
*  It endangers our distribution deal with Walmart. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=41.38s)]
*  And also, I am not a bank. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=44.06s)]
*  Nonetheless, Dylan Howard did get involved and he got involved by involving Keith Davidson, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=46.14s)]
*  who had a prior relationship with Stormy Daniels' manager, Gina Rodriguez, herself [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=52.42s)]
*  described as sort of an infamous story broker. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=56.86s)]
*  This is the seeming underbelly of the world that David Pecker sort of took us through. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=59.62s)]
*  This is a rung below the inquirers like that is too sketchy for us, the National Enquirer. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=66.34s)]
*  You need to go run this as an off book operation because again, us, the National Enquirer find [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=75.18s)]
*  this to be too dubious. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=79.98s)]
*  And I'm glad you use the word sketchy because sketchy comes to mind when I think about Keith [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=80.98s)]
*  He was not an easy witness for the prosecution, although an important one. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=85.58s)]
*  And I think part of that is because he did not want to acknowledge his full complicity [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=89.22s)]
*  in either of these deals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=93.7s)]
*  He was shadowy, for example, about how he got involved in representing Stormy Daniels [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=94.98s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=98.74s)]
*  I mean, it's a weird gig. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=99.74s)]
*  And how the deal was resurrected after he told Michael Cohen in mid-October after Cohen [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=101.02s)]
*  had failed to fund the settlement, I'm out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=105.94s)]
*  And by the way, I don't represent Stormy Daniels or Gina Rodriguez anymore. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=108.6s)]
*  Nonetheless, Michael Cohen gets called back into action and that whole deal gets papered [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=112.94s)]
*  in a matter of like 24 hours. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=117.82s)]
*  We know that because of the banker. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=119.78s)]
*  What was your impression? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=122.46s)]
*  I know I think both of you sort of were on the same page that Pecker was. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=123.46s)]
*  He was interesting witness and credible and sort of frank and very and not shadowy and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=127.96s)]
*  not squirrely and sort of very upfront about what he does and what world he operates in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=132.26s)]
*  And for that reason was a fairly credible witness, I think was the judgment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=135.84s)]
*  What did you think of Davidson today? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=139.62s)]
*  Look, I thought Davidson was also basically straight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  And the most important is he really brought us to the precipice of Stormy Daniels and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  the huge crisis that it is. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=150.02s)]
*  There was the all these sort of bland text at every sort of step. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=151.5s)]
*  And then when the Access Hollywood tape hits, you have him talking to Dylan Howard and say, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=156.5s)]
*  he is so effed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  And it's the end. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=166.02s)]
*  Wave the white flag. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  So in other words, he was very effective in reinforcing the notion that at this point, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=168.62s)]
*  it's a nitroglycerin crisis that has to be dealt with when Planet Hollywood drops, when [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=175.58s)]
*  Access Hollywood. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=181.86s)]
*  Sorry, Access Hollywood. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=182.86s)]
*  I always do that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=183.86s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=184.86s)]
*  I don't want to defame the wonderful restaurant. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=185.86s)]
*  So the business idea. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=190.62s)]
*  So the key, the key sort of, yeah, the key kind of narrative point that I took away again, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=193.38s)]
*  I'm following this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=198.14s)]
*  I haven't read the transcript yet. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=199.14s)]
*  I'm following these in the Slack channel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=200.14s)]
*  But the idea that there was the McDougal deal, that it set off some alarms internally at [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=201.62s)]
*  AMI. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  Then there's the Stormy deal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  And then the Stormy deal kind of sputters out and Michael Cohen is being squirrely and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=211.14s)]
*  not really coming up. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=214.94s)]
*  And that's dead. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=216.74s)]
*  And what resurrects it is the crisis of the Access Hollywood. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=217.9s)]
*  Well, yes and no, because crisis of Access Hollywood is what precipitates the initial [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=221.5s)]
*  deal negotiations. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=225.54s)]
*  At some point it falls apart. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=227.06s)]
*  Oh, it falls apart after, okay. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=228.94s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=230.46s)]
*  In mid-October after Access Hollywood already happens. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=231.46s)]
*  But Dylan Howard and others decide it has to be dealt with because Stormy Daniels and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=234.58s)]
*  Gina Rodriguez are sort of now separated from Keith Davidson, are going out and shopping [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=239.94s)]
*  her story. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=245.02s)]
*  So you've got a real problem. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=246.02s)]
*  You've got to. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=247.02s)]
*  And that's the bigger point. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=248.02s)]
*  There are hiccups in the road, but the urgency is always there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=249.02s)]
*  And that's the thing that's most important because really what is the defense going to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=251.94s)]
*  say about that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  It's all set up to try to really savage Michael Cohen, but he's out there paying $130,000 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=257.94s)]
*  knowing that he can't even take someone to lunch without Trump's approval. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=263.94s)]
*  What's the actual narrative that has him doing that that isn't trying to put out this huge [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=267.82s)]
*  fire? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=273.70000000000005s)]
*  But I will say Keith Davidson was really impossible for the prosecution today because [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=274.70000000000005s)]
*  he would not say, at least in response to a question that Mershon would allow, that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=278.66s)]
*  he understood that Trump was the ultimate pocketbook for the Stormy Daniels settlement. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=284.54s)]
*  And prosecutors desperately wanted him to say that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=290.74s)]
*  And I think there were experienced lawyers in the room, Harry included, sort of looking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=293.66s)]
*  at him being like, can you ask this question in a way the guy can answer? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  But he needed to lay the foundation for the fact that Keith Davidson had an understanding [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=301.5s)]
*  at all that it wasn't just an assumption that Trump was going to pay it, but that it wasn't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=306.26s)]
*  Cohen freelancing either. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=311.82s)]
*  And they didn't get that neatly and cleanly today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=313.3s)]
*  They might on Thursday. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=315.3s)]
*  There was a bunch of texts between the two that were displayed today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=317.34s)]
*  I think we might even have some courtroom sketches of this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=320.34s)]
*  And these are texts between the inquirer, the AMI due Dylan Howard, who's not Pecker, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=322.78s)]
*  and Davidson. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=329.94s)]
*  What is the substance of those exchanges? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=332.26s)]
*  I mean, I think the substance of those exchanges is mostly to show, A, these guys were in touch [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=333.58s)]
*  very, very, very frequently. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=339.18s)]
*  Yes, this was their work in this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  They're working this deal. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  And they both understand that both sides have an interest in coming to these agreements, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=344.66s)]
*  first McDougall and then Stormy Daniels. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=350.74s)]
*  Even though Davidson testified, he sort of wanted to rid himself of the whole thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  He found Cohen loathsome and detestable. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=356.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=358.86s)]
*  Ultimately, he kind of, you know, just when he thinks he's out, he gets pulled back into [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=359.86s)]
*  doing this deal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=363.5s)]
*  What sides of the same seeming world? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=365.3s)]
*  Yeah, let's let's talk about just quickly here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=366.98s)]
*  Ninety seconds. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=369.62s)]
*  I'm going to put on the clock for you to talk about the strangeness of the E. Jean Carroll [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=370.66s)]
*  deposition court reporter and the C-SPAN archives. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=375.22s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=378.7s)]
*  Quite clearly what it was about is what you said, that they were being obstreperous and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=379.7s)]
*  not not stipulating. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=384.5s)]
*  Everybody stipulates. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=387.06s)]
*  So they were going through the sort of first grade, first year law school requirements [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=388.06s)]
*  for business records, exception, et cetera. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=392.1s)]
*  I thought the jury was going to be sort of, you know, very bored and even irked. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=394.58s)]
*  They actually seem to be paying attention to this as if it was. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=399.38s)]
*  But take me through that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=402.18s)]
*  I mean, I read the monologue, so I understand the point. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=403.18s)]
*  But like just hammer at home, like you stipulate, you say, like, we all know, like, here's a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=406.06s)]
*  campaign tape. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=410.26s)]
*  It's in public record. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=411.7s)]
*  Stipulate that it's accurate. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=412.7s)]
*  We know this is the real voice of Donald Trump as sorted out by C-SPAN. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=413.7s)]
*  It's not just that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=416.98s)]
*  Yeah, that C-SPAN did in the regular course of business by someone who had the duty to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=417.98s)]
*  do it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=422.14s)]
*  Point being that when you don't stipulate, when you have to you have to establish a sort [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=423.14s)]
*  of chain of custody of this document and authenticate it with the person who can speak to authority [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=426.3s)]
*  of its authenticity. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  You have to say be able to show it is what it looks like. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=436.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=437.02s)]
*  And then the banker who seems like basically he's basically like Michael Cohen is really [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=438.02s)]
*  rushing and desperate. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=446.18s)]
*  And he doesn't know much about this deal, but is maybe like sniffing around it, not [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=448.58s)]
*  being great. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=451.82s)]
*  I think what he's saying to himself is Michael Cohen was always in a rush and real estate [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=452.94s)]
*  transactions are often rushed like this. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=457.18s)]
*  So even though there was something a little fuzzy about it, maybe in retrospect and certainly [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=459.18s)]
*  once we knew about Stormy Daniels, while we were going through it, it didn't strike us [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=463.5s)]
*  as out of the ordinary because it was totally in keeping with how Michael Cohen behaved [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=467.94s)]
*  and totally in keeping with how our real estate clients behaved. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=471.62s)]
*  And Michael Cohen represented to us on paper that he was establishing a real estate consultancy [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=474.53999999999996s)]
*  and paying a retainer to a lawyer. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=479.74s)]
*  But also, they hold that thought, hold that thought, because you're going to stay right [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=481.14000000000004s)]
*  here. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=484.26s)]
*  I want to talk about that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=485.26s)]
*  The gag or a ruling, how Trump is enjoying his time in the freezing courthouse eight [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=486.62s)]
*  hours a day. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=491.62s)]
*  That's all next. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=492.62s)]
*  Stick around. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJ9B4A6DYg&t=493.62s)]
