# Harvard scholar predicts how Supreme Court will rule on key Trump legal battles
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0)
*  Joining me now is Lawrence Tribe, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=0.0s)]
*  University Professor of Constitutional Law, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  Emeritus at Harvard University. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=3.66s)]
*  Professor Tribe, you've been very outspoken [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=5.9s)]
*  and active on this issue. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=8.02s)]
*  And I want to start with you on this interesting legal question, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=8.82s)]
*  which is the adoption of what's called the questions presented [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=11.74s)]
*  in the grant. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=16.2s)]
*  So basically, the court says, here's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=17.18s)]
*  the framing for what is being debated before us, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=18.98s)]
*  what we're ruling on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=22.88s)]
*  And the question presented, they adopted, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=23.82s)]
*  is the one from Trump's cert petition. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=25.78s)]
*  And it's a simple one. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=28.580000000000002s)]
*  Did the Colorado Supreme Court err [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=29.8s)]
*  in ordering President Trump excluded [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=32.08s)]
*  from the 2024 presidential primary ballot? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=34.16s)]
*  And the reason that's interesting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=36.28s)]
*  is because the Colorado GOP, which also appealed, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=37.6s)]
*  had much more sort of specific and technical questions [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=40.8s)]
*  presented. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=43.92s)]
*  But it looks like the court is adopting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=44.68s)]
*  the kind of broadest possible, which gives them [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=46.3s)]
*  any possible avenue to consider. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=49.0s)]
*  I think you're exactly right, Chris. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  They adopted a question that doesn't constrain them [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=55.68s)]
*  in any way. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=59.0s)]
*  They are going to decide whether to affirm or reverse [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=60.22s)]
*  the Colorado Supreme Court. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=64.74s)]
*  There are many exit ramps. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=66.54s)]
*  There are many approaches. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  What is interesting is that if you are a strict textualist, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=70.3s)]
*  you really read the words of the 14th Amendment Section 3. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=74.54s)]
*  Or if you are a so-called originalist, a historian, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=79.94s)]
*  someone like Jack Rakoff of Stanford, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=84.14s)]
*  a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=88.1s)]
*  leaves no doubt that the right answer would be the one [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  that conservatives would give. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=94.74s)]
*  It is more prudential moderates and liberals, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=97.14s)]
*  like Kagan and Jackson and Sotomayor, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=101.33999999999999s)]
*  who might wring their hands over the broad systemic impact [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=104.22s)]
*  on democracy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  That's an ironic situation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=110.1s)]
*  It's filled with ironies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=111.66s)]
*  I mean, if you read the briefing submitted by Donald Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=113.86s)]
*  and also by the Republicans of Colorado, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=117.46s)]
*  it's filled with peons of praise to democracy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=124.66s)]
*  The people should not be deprived of their vote. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=128.7s)]
*  But Mr. Raffensperger, can't you just find me 11,180 of them? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=131.66s)]
*  This is all about depriving the people of the right [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=137.42s)]
*  to end a presidency by engaging in what [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=143.1s)]
*  a detailed trial in Colorado concluded was insurrection. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=148.62s)]
*  I don't think the court is likely to take [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=153.54s)]
*  a technical off-ramp. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=155.98s)]
*  I don't think it's likely to hold [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=158.5s)]
*  that the words of the oath that the president took [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=160.9s)]
*  to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=164.14s)]
*  didn't use the word support the Constitution. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=167.5s)]
*  And therefore, the president is not covered. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=172.1s)]
*  I don't think they're going to take a kind of technical, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=175.66s)]
*  highly legalistic approach. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=181.26s)]
*  I think that the conservatives are [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=183.94s)]
*  going to have to establish that they mean what they say. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=186.66s)]
*  And the one way they could do that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=191.04s)]
*  is to say that although the original meaning of Section 3 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=193.14s)]
*  of the 14th Amendment was that you didn't have to be tried [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=197.7s)]
*  or convicted of insurrection, as long as there was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=201.7s)]
*  a determination that you were an insurrectionist. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=206.78s)]
*  Congress didn't need to create a special scheme to do that, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=210.78s)]
*  because people knew what the score was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=215.54s)]
*  at the time of the Confederacy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=219.22s)]
*  But now you have to become a little bit of a living [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=222.62s)]
*  constitutionalist. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=225.78s)]
*  Decades have passed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=227.5s)]
*  Now things are different. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  Now there's a lot more controversy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=230.82s)]
*  about the meaning of these terms. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=233.18s)]
*  Now we need to wait for Congress to figure it all out [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=235.1s)]
*  and put a procedure in place that is more uniform nationwide. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=239.1s)]
*  That would be a plausible decision, not one consistent [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=243.94s)]
*  with genuine textualism or originalism, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=247.9s)]
*  but one that might make sense to the broad middle of the court. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=251.66s)]
*  At the same time, they've got this very easy case [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  about absolute presidential immunity, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=258.34s)]
*  or whether the fact that he was on trial [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=261.5s)]
*  for an impeachable offense and then acquitted by the Senate, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=265.26s)]
*  whether that somehow precludes his running. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=269.78s)]
*  Those are easy questions. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=272.85999999999996s)]
*  The court is certainly not going to go with Trump on those. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=274.58s)]
*  So if you're a pragmatist, you are [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=278.38s)]
*  likely to say that they could cut this Gordian knot in half. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=281.62s)]
*  They could basically say that, of course, presidents are not [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=286.74s)]
*  immune from crimes they commit while they're in office [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=291.22s)]
*  just because they're wielding their presidential power, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=294.42s)]
*  especially when they're wielding it to overturn democracy [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=298.22s)]
*  and stay in power beyond the four-year vested term. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=302.26s)]
*  But on the other hand, even though they [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=307.54s)]
*  have to face the music in criminal court, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=309.66s)]
*  we are not going to let one state after another make up [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  special procedures to figure out whether they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=316.26s)]
*  are insurrectionists. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=320.26s)]
*  I don't think the court would damage itself very much, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=322.06s)]
*  except with purists and people like me and Judge Looting, who [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=325.3s)]
*  take the text a little more seriously. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=329.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I think, a very interesting and plausible way [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=333.06s)]
*  of seeing both the legal reasoning here, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=336.74s)]
*  the practical reasoning, the sort of modes of political of, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=338.86s)]
*  the modes of constitutional interpretation [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=341.86s)]
*  and the weird cross pressures within them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=343.62s)]
*  To go back to Judge Posner's view on judging, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  Laurence Tribe, it's always such a great pleasure [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=349.7s)]
*  to hear you talk about this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=351.46s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=352.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD_ME9ebdl0&t=373.62s)]
