# ‘Tragically ironic’: Family of Palestinian shooting victim speaks out
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY)
*  Every year since Hisham Ortani enrolled at Brown University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=0.0s)]
*  he's spent Thanksgiving at his grandmother's house in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=3.5s)]
*  Burlington, Vermont, just a few hours away. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=6.22s)]
*  His uncle lives next door, and it's a place that Hisham, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=8.52s)]
*  you see here with his parents, has visited since he was a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=11.96s)]
*  little boy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=14.92s)]
*  This year, the 20-year-old was joined by two lifelong friends. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=16.22s)]
*  One of them is Kinan Abdel Hamid, who's a student at [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=19.16s)]
*  Haverford College in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=22.56s)]
*  You see him there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=24.1s)]
*  He runs track. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=24.6s)]
*  Here he is on the right with Hisham when the two boys were [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  at a model United Nations event at their American friend's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=28.46s)]
*  school, Quaker School in Ramallah in the West Bank. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=32.06s)]
*  The other friend is Tassin Ali Ahmed, a student at Trinity [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=34.9s)]
*  College in Connecticut, all three of Palestinian descent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=38.18s)]
*  On Saturday, they went bowling for a birthday party for Hisham's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=42.44s)]
*  twin cousins who turned eight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=45.22s)]
*  Afterwards, they went for a walk around the neighborhood, just [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=46.84s)]
*  a quintessentially American scene in the best sense. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=49.58s)]
*  These young men with astoundingly bright futures and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=51.72s)]
*  global roots spending a Thanksgiving holiday break in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=54.56s)]
*  New England away from their demanding schoolwork, laughing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=57.5s)]
*  with friends and family. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=60.2s)]
*  And then it turned into a quintessentially American scene [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=62.3s)]
*  in the worst sense. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=64.64s)]
*  They had gone just a few blocks when a white man in the hoodie [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=66.1s)]
*  approached them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=68.78s)]
*  They moved to get out of his way, but the man pulled a pistol [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=69.78s)]
*  and started firing without saying a word. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=72.18s)]
*  Kinan was shot in the glute area and was released from the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=74.72s)]
*  hospital today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=77.42s)]
*  Tassin was shot in the chest. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=78.52s)]
*  Hisham was shot through his clavicle and the bullet lodge in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=80.68s)]
*  his spine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=83.66s)]
*  According to his mother, he may not be able to walk again and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=84.82s)]
*  has a long recovery. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=87.36s)]
*  Now, we don't know much about the intent of the shooter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=89.26s)]
*  We do know that the time when the three friends were shot, the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=92.32s)]
*  two were wearing traditional Palestinian scars, kafias, and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=94.56s)]
*  they were speaking a combination of Arabic and English. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=98.06s)]
*  A suspect, a 40-year-old white male, has been arrested and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=100.84s)]
*  charged with three counts of attempted murder. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=103.74s)]
*  And local police and the FBI are investigating the possibility [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=106.1s)]
*  it was a hate crime. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=108.88s)]
*  Rich Price is Hisham Murtani's uncle, who he was visiting with [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=110.58s)]
*  in Burlington, and he joins me now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=114.22s)]
*  Rich, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  I wonder if first you could just give us an update on how your [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=119.6s)]
*  nephew is doing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=122.64s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me and for a chance to talk about my [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=125.64s)]
*  nephew. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=129.18s)]
*  He's demonstrating incredible resilience and strength, even [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=131.06s)]
*  sense of humor in the face of a really difficult time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  As you mentioned, he did sustain a devastating injury and his [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=141.66s)]
*  recovery is really long. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=146.58s)]
*  And as we've been talking about it, there's sort of a couple [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=148.52s)]
*  facets of his recovery. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=152.12s)]
*  One is, of course, medical and rehabilitation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=153.36s)]
*  The other is spirit and resilience. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=157.96s)]
*  And in that department, we're confident Hisham's going to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=162.4s)]
*  knock it out of the park. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=166.84s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to read a little bit of the statement [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=168.24s)]
*  because he can't speak for himself that he released and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=169.84s)]
*  that was read at a vigil at Brown University where he's a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=173.28s)]
*  student. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=175.46s)]
*  It's a long statement and very moving. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=176.82s)]
*  But one of the things he says, it's important to recognize this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=180.22s)]
*  is part of a larger story, that this hideous crime did not [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  happen in a vacuum. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=185.4s)]
*  As much as I appreciate and love every single one of you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=186.9s)]
*  today, I am but one casualty in this much wider conflict. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=188.9s)]
*  Can you tell me about Hisham and his time at Brown? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=193.88s)]
*  I've been so sort of taken with the image of these three young [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  men and the fact that they go to school in the West Bank and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=200.52s)]
*  they're in New England at these very fancy old American schools [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  and living sort of these lives sort of across straddling this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  wide divide. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll just say all three of them are incredible [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  young men. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=217.38s)]
*  As you said, they were guests around our Thanksgiving table [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=218.38s)]
*  as they have in the past. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=221.84s)]
*  And my wife and I have five sons and we went to bed the night [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=223.58s)]
*  of Thanksgiving and actually said to one another how lucky [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=227.82s)]
*  and grateful we were to have these three young, impressive [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=232.06s)]
*  men set an example for our sons in terms of their intellectual [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=236.8s)]
*  curiosity, their respectfulness, their kindness towards my [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=243.44s)]
*  sons. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=250.78s)]
*  All weekend long, they were playing board games with my [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=252.18s)]
*  sons. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=256.12s)]
*  They were playing ping pong with my boys. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=257.12s)]
*  And then I remember when I was at FIFA on the video games, as [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=259.22s)]
*  you said, they came to my eight-year-old twins birthday [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=263.06s)]
*  party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=266.2s)]
*  What college juniors want to do that on their Thanksgiving break? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=267.2s)]
*  But they did. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=271.2s)]
*  And they were playing with our sons and we got home from that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=272.2s)]
*  party. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=276.5s)]
*  And as you said, they decided to take a walk to get some fresh [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=277.5s)]
*  air. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=280.32s)]
*  And out of nowhere, this hateful individual stepped out of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=281.32s)]
*  dark and opened fire. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=288.44s)]
*  I had read that Isham's father, who I believe, if I'm not [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=294.44s)]
*  mistaken, is in the West Bank, right, had not wanted him to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=298.38s)]
*  come home for break thinking that obviously the situation [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=302.9s)]
*  there is very unstable and dangerous right now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  And there's just something so horrifically ironic about that, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=311.34s)]
*  obviously. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=315.0s)]
*  I'm not saying something novel here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=316.0s)]
*  But just that he stayed in the quiet and calm precincts of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=318.72s)]
*  Burlington, Vermont, and this happened. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=324.8s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=326.8s)]
*  I mean, my sister, you see her here with my nephew, has lived [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=328.8s)]
*  in the West Bank for the last couple of decades. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=334.94s)]
*  And I'm asked all the time, don't you worry about your [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=338.88s)]
*  sister? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=341.32s)]
*  Don't you worry about your nephews and your niece living [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=342.32s)]
*  in under occupation in the West Bank? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=345.92s)]
*  And of course I do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=348.28s)]
*  And it's tragically ironic that they would come spend, that he [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=350.56s)]
*  would come and his friends would come spend Thanksgiving in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=359.48s)]
*  Burlington, Vermont, of all places. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=363.56s)]
*  And this would happen to them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=365.28s)]
*  I feel a great sense of shame and sadness. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=367.28s)]
*  And it's, you know, Burlington, as you know, Chris, is a place [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=372.0s)]
*  that prides itself for being welcoming, diverse, inclusive. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=376.28s)]
*  And so it's unfathomable for us. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=383.6s)]
*  And I will say that the community here has really [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=388.04s)]
*  rallied behind us. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=392.92s)]
*  We're feeling incredible sense of support from people here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  And we're really grateful for that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=398.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=402.76s)]
*  And I got to say, covering this conflict, you know, one of the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=403.76s)]
*  struggles, I think, is sort of relating to different parts of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  the conflict. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=409.4s)]
*  And it's just human nature that certain things will grab you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mdIyqU_UJY&t=410.84s)]
