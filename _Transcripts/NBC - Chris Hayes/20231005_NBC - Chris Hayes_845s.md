# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 4
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. A little over 24 hours ago, for the very first time in all of American history, a House caucus deposed their own speaker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=0.0s)]
*  A group of hardline members, the Republican majority, led by Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, forced a vote to vacate the speaker's office, ousting Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=10.0s)]
*  Now, I'll admit, it is not super clear why Gaetz and his allies thought this was a good idea. The move left a lot of members of their own party bewildered and downright furious. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=20.0s)]
*  And it has sparked a resurgence of a consistent theme in this political era. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=31.0s)]
*  Whenever the Republican Party, or its leadership, acts in a particularly egregious, norm-shattering fashion, conservative politicians, members of the conservative media, and even many members of the mainstream media, rush to find some reason to blame Democrats. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=37.0s)]
*  We've seen it over and over. After Donald Trump won the Republican primary in 2016, it was Democrats who got the blame. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=54.0s)]
*  You see, liberals were too mean to Mitt Romney in the previous presidential cycle, helping to inoculate Trump and clear the way for him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=61.0s)]
*  People still make this argument to this day. During the first Trump impeachment, Republicans tried to blame then-speaker Nancy Pelosi for their failure to convict the president. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=69.0s)]
*  It was not their own political calculation or cowardice or moral blindness. No. It was Nancy Pelosi who was at fault for the way they voted. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=80.0s)]
*  And here's the thing, the worse Republican dysfunction gets, the harder conservatives and commentators seem to work to find any reason to identify Democrats as the root cause of it all. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=89.0s)]
*  It is almost comical. And so, just like clockwork, we are hearing all sorts of folks blaming liberals for Kevin McCarthy's ousterous speaker, even McCarthy himself. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=100.0s)]
*  I think today was a political decision by the Democrats. Democrats just removed the Republican speaker. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=115.0s)]
*  Democrats basically turned on Republicans and ousted Kevin McCarthy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=122.0s)]
*  Every one of the Democrats voted against McCarthy. That's what you get for trusting a Democrat. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=128.0s)]
*  The Democrats who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy, they could have done something about it. They could have thrown him a life raft. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=136.0s)]
*  I think a lot of these Democrats on the Problem Solvers Caucus need to be asked, why did you make this decision? Why didn't you step in? Why didn't you cut a deal with McCarthy? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=142.0s)]
*  They're all in this town saying, well, I want to work with the other side. Yesterday was the chance and they failed badly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=152.0s)]
*  I think there was an opportunity for folks to put the country above the insanity. I think it left a lot of people with a bad taste in their mouth. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=157.0s)]
*  Oh, you got a bad taste in your mouth because the Democrats didn't do what you wanted. Is that right, Mike Lawler, running in a plus 10 Biden district in the state of New York? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=166.0s)]
*  We have even seen the interim Republican speaker, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, last seen banging that gavel very hard, very angrily, exacting a little petty revenge against the Democrats for their betrayal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=174.0s)]
*  He ordered Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and former Democratic leader Steny Hoyer to vacate their what's called hideaway offices, these small offices in the Capitol itself in what Pelosi described as a sharp departure from tradition. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=186.0s)]
*  I should note Pelosi wasn't even present for the vote to remove McCarthy. She didn't vote against him. She's been in San Francisco for the funeral of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=200.0s)]
*  So yesterday, all the Democrats who were present in the House faced a tactical question about what to do in this nearly unprecedented situation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=209.0s)]
*  Remember, it's been more than a century since the last time a House caucus had to decide on how to vote on vacating a speaker. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=219.0s)]
*  And the only reason that we had this vote was because the rules package negotiated by Gates and the Holdouts and Kevin McCarthy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=225.0s)]
*  They created the conditions for the vote to happen in the first place. And we have certainly never seen this level of House dysfunction before. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=232.0s)]
*  It's genuinely historic. And I'll say there really were arguments on both sides about how Democrats should handle the vote. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=239.0s)]
*  I talked to a bunch of people yesterday as I was reporting this out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=246.0s)]
*  But those arguments were arguments about how the Democratic caucus should exercise its own political interests and the interests of those people they represent. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=249.0s)]
*  The idea that Democrats should have protected Kevin McCarthy for the good of the country is nonsense. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=260.0s)]
*  First of all, if Kevin McCarthy wanted Democrats to vote for him in this vote that only came about because of the rules package he negotiated, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=268.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, who's a big boy, could have tried to persuade Democrats to make a deal with them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=278.0s)]
*  That's the way politics works. He did not do that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=284.0s)]
*  In fact, he reportedly waited until the last minute to call the Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, and his allies said, pointedly, publicly and privately, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=288.0s)]
*  that McCarthy was opposed to cutting any deals with Democrats. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=297.0s)]
*  But the even deeper issue at play, as one House Democratic staffer explains in a great thread today, was just basic trust. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=301.0s)]
*  Quote, we did not trust Kevin McCarthy, and he gave us no reason to. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=312.0s)]
*  He could have done so, and I suspect saved his gavel through fairly simple actions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=317.0s)]
*  He chose not to do that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=322.0s)]
*  Democrats could not make a deal with Kevin McCarthy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=325.0s)]
*  They could not support his speakership because his word means nothing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=328.0s)]
*  They could not trust him. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=332.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, McCarthy was already in front of all of us. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=335.0s)]
*  I mean, he wasn't secretive about this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=339.0s)]
*  He was in the process of ripping up the biggest deal he ever made on the debt ceiling. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=341.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=345.0s)]
*  They cut the deal, Joe Biden, and then folks in his caucus got mad about the deal, and he was about to go and undercut that deal, rip it up. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=346.0s)]
*  There was no reason for Democrats to believe that he would not turn around and rip up another deal with them tomorrow. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=355.0s)]
*  In fact, he had already promised his caucus that he would do that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=363.0s)]
*  So he had to be lying to someone, either lying to his caucus or lying to the Democrats if he cut a deal with them. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=368.0s)]
*  But he's lying to someone. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=374.0s)]
*  What good would it do them to save McCarthy? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=376.0s)]
*  And then the next day, watch him push forward an impeachment of Joe Biden, massively cut social funding, put a whole bunch of awful poison pill provisions into must pass legislation, steer the country into another shutdown. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=379.0s)]
*  As Talking Points memo founder Josh Marshall points out, Republicans bad behavior and destruction is assumed in Washington. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=395.0s)]
*  It is given. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=402.0s)]
*  It's like gravity. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=403.0s)]
*  Everyone knows and expect it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=404.0s)]
*  Everyone else has to work around it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=405.0s)]
*  That means that Democrats have to be the ones to figure out how to make the government work. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=407.0s)]
*  Of course, the dysfunctional, misbehaving Republicans are all grown ass adults with moral agency. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=411.0s)]
*  Like they're responsible for their actions. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=421.0s)]
*  They make decisions. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=424.0s)]
*  They can do good things or bad things. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=425.0s)]
*  So I cannot quite believe this needs to be said. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=427.0s)]
*  But the people to blame for Republicans blowing up their own speaker are Republicans. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=430.0s)]
*  Congressman Joe Nagoos is a Democrat of Colorado, a member of his party's leadership, and he joins me now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=438.0s)]
*  First of all, what do you think of the argument that you sold out the country yesterday in pursuit of petty political aims and had an opportunity to be the bigger man? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=446.0s)]
*  I guess I don't know what the argument is and vote to keep Kevin McCarthy as your speaker. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=458.0s)]
*  Well, good evening, Chris. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=464.0s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=467.0s)]
*  It's a nonsensical argument. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=468.0s)]
*  I agree with your summation as to the decision making that occurred over the course of the last couple of days. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=470.0s)]
*  Let me just first say I think it's important as a broad principle to state what has been made abundantly clear over the course of the last nine months, which is that House Republicans are singularly focused on fighting each other. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=475.0s)]
*  And House Democrats are focused on fighting for the American people, on delivering real results for working families across our country. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=487.0s)]
*  Now, it's unfortunate that House Republicans chose a different path. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=493.0s)]
*  That path of chaos and extremism and dysfunction has had real consequences for the American people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=497.0s)]
*  You outlined some of them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=503.0s)]
*  And, of course, it culminated in the events of the last 24 hours with respect to the particular argument that you're noting that some Republicans have apparently are parroting and using it as an excuse over the last 24 hours. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=504.0s)]
*  I think it is ludicrous on its face. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=517.0s)]
*  The notion that Democrats are somehow responsible for electing a Republican speaker is unmoored from reality and from any kind of historical precedents. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=520.0s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, Chris, of course, the American people understand that they recognize that the majority party in the House selects the speaker because they watched in January when the Republican conference was in disarray, incapable of electing a speaker. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=529.0s)]
*  And the only reason why that process concluded with the ascension of Speaker McCarthy is because he capitulated to every demand made by the extreme right wing of his caucus, including the rule change that you noted that enabled those same chaos agents to ultimately vacate the speaker's office. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=543.0s)]
*  And that was a rule change that House Democrats voted against. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=562.0s)]
*  So it's a crisis of their own making. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=565.0s)]
*  It is emblematic of the dysfunction that they have brought to Washington, and it's unfortunate for the country. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=567.0s)]
*  The other thing in this, the guy named Aaron Fischer, who's a staffer who wrote this thread. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=573.0s)]
*  One of the things that he I thought did a really good job of explaining to is that this the CR that they passed is a continuing resolution to keep the government open on the day you there was no communication. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=578.0s)]
*  He's been promising the right everything. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=587.0s)]
*  He suddenly pivots throws this thing in your laps. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=588.0s)]
*  Here's all the funding you've got. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=592.0s)]
*  You don't have 90 minutes, not even 90 minutes to read it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=594.0s)]
*  Vote for it or you shut down the government and I need a two thirds majority. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=597.0s)]
*  That's the last thing he did before he got booted from being speaker. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=600.0s)]
*  That was the last action of the guy that you're supposed to have any trust or good faith in. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=606.0s)]
*  Yeah, with one caveat, Chris, it was the second to last thing he did, because, of course, the last thing he did was following that vote in which the vast majority of Democrats, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=613.0s)]
*  nearly 99 percent of our caucus, voted in favor of keeping the government open, notwithstanding that Republicans in mass voted against it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=621.0s)]
*  The speaker, former speaker, then went on television and attempted to blame Democrats for voting, I guess, apparently for voting for that bill. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=629.0s)]
*  So I read that same Twitter thread that you referenced, and I thought it articulated well the numerous ways in which, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=637.0s)]
*  unfortunately, the former speaker had, as I said, capitulated to the far right, had reneged on agreements that were made. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=644.0s)]
*  But again, this is bigger than one person. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=650.0s)]
*  It is emblematic of the extremism that has taken root in the House Republican Conference. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=653.0s)]
*  That fundamentally, I think, is what's before the country now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=658.0s)]
*  Yeah, and these are the eight, we should just put up the eight Republicans that voted to oust him that were sort of running this operation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=662.0s)]
*  To your point about being bigger than one speaker, I don't want to get too in the weeds here, but I think it's just important for people to understand, like, tangibly the issue here. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=670.0s)]
*  The government's going to need to be funded in 45 days because there's a continuing resolution passed for 45 days. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=676.0s)]
*  There was a deal laid out at the debt ceiling for the House and the Senate for basically these kind of top line budget numbers for everyone to go back and pass appropriations that are in line with those numbers. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=681.0s)]
*  That was the deal. We all watched it happen. We covered it. McCarthy met with Joe Biden. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=691.0s)]
*  The Senate is doing that. They're basically going back and saying, OK, this is what this is. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=696.0s)]
*  We got the Ag bill. We got the defense bill. Here's the top line numbers. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=700.0s)]
*  The Republicans want to renege on that deal. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=704.0s)]
*  They want to rip up that deal. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=708.0s)]
*  And so there will be another shutdown because they want to rip up the deal that they made to avoid the last shutdown. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=710.0s)]
*  Am I right or am I losing my mind? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=715.0s)]
*  Look, the House Republicans have been on an island for quite some time now. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=719.0s)]
*  You are right with respect to the deal that you mentioned, the Fiscal Responsibility Act. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=723.0s)]
*  The impetus for that deal, just by way of background and context, I think for your viewers, is that the Republicans manufactured a crisis with respect to the debt ceiling. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=727.0s)]
*  They brought us to the brink of a catastrophic default on our debt and then ultimately negotiated this agreement to avert that crisis they had created. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=736.0s)]
*  And in a mere matter of weeks, Speaker McCarthy, former Speaker McCarthy reneged on that very same deal. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=745.0s)]
*  Senate Republicans have been working on a bipartisan basis with Senate Democrats and the president, of course, is supportive of the agreement that he reached. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=750.0s)]
*  But again, it's consistent with the way in which the House Republican conference has chosen to govern, which in our lack thereof, I suppose that these are not serious people. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=757.0s)]
*  It's not a serious party. They are not prepared to govern. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=767.0s)]
*  The American people see that. And unfortunately, if past is prologue, I think that we're in for some choppy waters ahead. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=770.0s)]
*  I'm hopeful that some Republicans in that conference will walk away from the extreme maga, you know, sort of element in the caucus that has metastasized and work with us to find a bipartisan path forward. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=777.0s)]
*  Again, supporting our leader, Hakeem Jeffries, who has led our conference in the country with unity and with vision and I think strategic brilliance of really trying to deliver results to the American people. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=789.0s)]
*  But, you know, time will tell. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=799.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think choppy waters is apt. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=801.0s)]
*  And again, we're going to be in the same place. Like, it doesn't matter who they get. They could, you know, they could they could vote for the Hamburglar for speaker. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=805.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. It's going to be the same problem. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=812.0s)]
*  Congressman Jonah Goose always always try to get you to smile before and laugh before we leave. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=815.0s)]
*  We succeeded today. Thank you, Congressman. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=820.0s)]
*  Always good to be with you, Chris. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=822.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WGGawWxT48&t=835.0s)]
