# Chris Hayes: Why the Eric Adams indictment is ‘strangely reassuring’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw)
*  Now, on the face of it, this is not a great day for New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=0.0s)]
*  Eric Adams has become the first sitting mayor of the city to be criminally indicted, which [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=3.0s)]
*  is pretty remarkable. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=6.68s)]
*  You think about how long the city's been around. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=7.68s)]
*  The charges are also, though, I find in a strange way, reassuring. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=10.24s)]
*  I mean, they show we have a functioning federal government that still holds the rule of law [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  to be a bedrock sacrosanct thing, particularly in the Department of Justice. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=17.28s)]
*  I mean, take a step back and look at the DOJ that Joe Biden inherited from his predecessor, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=22.12s)]
*  after Trump's endless, constant attempts to subvert federal law enforcement and convert [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=28.2s)]
*  it into a political tool of the president. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=33.44s)]
*  Particularly when you look at the Southern District of New York, arguably the most influential [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=37.08s)]
*  federal prosecutor's office in the country, the one that just indicted Eric Adams. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=40.4s)]
*  When Trump became the president, the Southern District was run by Preet Bharara. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=49.96s)]
*  He was the Southern District U.S. attorney under Barack Obama. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=50.96s)]
*  Now we'd later learn that Trump was regularly calling Bharara, trying to cultivate a personal [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=55.28s)]
*  relationship that made Bharara so uncomfortable, he reported the context to his bosses at the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=59.6s)]
*  DOJ and eventually refused a call from the president. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Less than a day later, Bharara was fired. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=68.4s)]
*  Trump's personal lawyer, Mark Kazowitz, would later brag that he convinced Trump to fire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=71.16s)]
*  Bharara, telling the president, this guy is going to get you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=75.4s)]
*  It was a pattern Trump would repeat over and over and over again as president, whether [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=79.68s)]
*  it was firing FBI Director James Comey after Trump asked Comey to drop the criminal investigation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  into then national security adviser Michael Flynn or having his attorney general Bill [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=90.08s)]
*  Barr fire yet another U.S. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=94.72s)]
*  Attorney for the Southern District, Jeffrey Berman, the man that he had appointed in 2020 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=96.76s)]
*  after Berman had prosecuted Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and opened several [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  other investigations of people and banks in Trump's orbit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=106.28s)]
*  The cardinal rule is that partisan political concerns are not supposed to enter into any [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  decision making, and that rule was repeatedly violated. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=116.28s)]
*  Now we managed to push back every attempt to interfere in our cases, and we were successful [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=120.92s)]
*  every time, but it was difficult. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=128.8s)]
*  It was two and a half years of kind of unrelenting pushback. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  Unrelenting pressure, two and a half years. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=136.52s)]
*  Trump was constantly pushing for prosecutions of his perceived enemies, including Hillary [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=139.0s)]
*  Clinton and John Kerry. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=143.6s)]
*  He said this publicly. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=144.6s)]
*  This is not some scoop here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=145.6s)]
*  His attorney general Bill Barr also distorted and mischaracterized the Mueller report on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=147.96s)]
*  the Trump campaign's Russia contacts, and he appointed a special counsel, John Durham, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=152.28s)]
*  to investigate those FBI investigators who had looked into Trump and Russia, an investigation [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=156.56s)]
*  which yielded two embarrassing acquittals for Durham. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=161.96s)]
*  We've blocked so much of this out, but Trump was constantly spending his time as president [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=167.24s)]
*  trying to manipulate the DOJ to do his bidding, to destroy any independents, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=172.28s)]
*  And of course, that pressure culminated in his attempted coup after the 2020 election [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=178.76s)]
*  when Trump was trying to name Jeffrey Clark, a mid-level DOJ lawyer, as a temporary attorney [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=183.68s)]
*  general so that Clark could then use the department's good name and its stationery to send out a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=189.88s)]
*  letter saying the election was rigged and get state legislators to just overturn the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=194.08s)]
*  election. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=199.24s)]
*  Now, compare that to the Biden DOJ under Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Department of Justice [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=200.24s)]
*  that has bent over backwards to be independent of the White House and partisan political [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=207.24s)]
*  concerns. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=213.56s)]
*  They appointed a special counsel, a Republican and Trump appointee, to investigate the sitting [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=215.24s)]
*  President Biden's own handling of classified documents. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=220.44s)]
*  They prosecuted a string of high profile Democratic officials and family members on a variety [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=223.4s)]
*  of charges. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=229.16s)]
*  Today, I'm announcing that my office has obtained a three count indictment charging Senator [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=230.16s)]
*  Robert Menendez. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=235.68s)]
*  Breaking news, NBC has learned that the Department of Justice is expected to announce an indictment [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=237.16s)]
*  against long-term Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=242.2s)]
*  Today, we are announcing campaign finance, bribery and conspiracy charges against Eric [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  Adams, the mayor of New York City. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  An extraordinary step by the Justice Department earlier today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=254.56s)]
*  Federal prosecutors have indicted President Joe Biden's sole surviving son, Hunter Biden, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=257.88s)]
*  on three criminal counts. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=263.84s)]
*  So the Biden DOJ has prosecuted a sitting Democratic senator, a sitting Democratic congressman [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=265.32s)]
*  in the Rio Grande Valley from a swing district that possibly only he could win as a Democrat. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=270.44s)]
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams, 40 days out from an election in which there's a whole [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=274.88s)]
*  bunch of swing districts around New York City Democrats are trying to win. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=279.08s)]
*  And Joe Biden's last surviving son, who is awaiting sentencing on charges that even Trey [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=283.44s)]
*  Gowdy, the far right former congressman and prosecutor, thinks are pretty ludicrous. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=289.2s)]
*  ...gun prosecutions for six years. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=293.56s)]
*  But I'll bet you there weren't 10 cases prosecuted nationwide of addicts or unlawful drug users [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=297.2s)]
*  who possess firearms or allowed on applications. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  I bet there weren't a dozen, which makes you wonder of all the cases you could be pursuing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  in Delaware, why are you pursuing this one? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=312.2s)]
*  It is entirely possible that Joe Biden will leave the presidency and never see his son [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=315.44s)]
*  outside of a prison again. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=319.44s)]
*  This is the administration the Republicans say have politically weaponized the Department [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  of Justice when the opposite is actually true. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=327.28s)]
*  It's a point that the current U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=330.72s)]
*  Williams, made today when he announced the Adams indictment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=333.68s)]
*  The Southern District of New York remains committed to rooting out corruption without [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  fear or favor and without regard to partisan politics. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  We are not focused on the right or the left. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=345.6s)]
*  We are focused only on right and wrong. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=348.94000000000005s)]
*  Now, I want to be clear here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=350.92s)]
*  This doesn't mean the Department of Justice always gets it right, the prosecutors always [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=353.0s)]
*  get it right, that the people being prosecuted are guilty, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=355.86s)]
*  They might not be. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=360.08s)]
*  We're going to see in trials. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=361.08s)]
*  But at the level of the institutional functioning of the Department of Justice, this is how [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=364.08s)]
*  the DOJ is supposed to work. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=369.28s)]
*  Even though there is essentially zero political benefit in it for Democrats. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=372.12s)]
*  And here's the thing, if Donald Trump wins, I think this is all going to change. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=377.56s)]
*  These institutions could be put in the hands of Trump's creepiest authoritarian sycophants, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=382.86s)]
*  like this Republican lawyer who's rumored to be in the running for a top DOJ post and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=389.36s)]
*  who said this last year. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=393.68s)]
*  I will reign hell on Washington, D.C. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=396.44s)]
*  We're going to fire a lot of people in the executive branch of the deep state. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=399.58000000000004s)]
*  Number two, we're going to indict. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=404.12s)]
*  We're going to indict Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and James Biden and every other scum [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=405.24s)]
*  ball, sleazeball, Biden. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  We're going to deport a lot of people, 10 million people when growing, anchor babies, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  their parents, their grandparents. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=416.24s)]
*  We're going to put kids in cages. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=417.96s)]
*  It's going to be glorious. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=419.44s)]
*  We're going to detain a lot of people in the D.C. gulag and get my. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=420.44s)]
*  OK, so Davis now says he's just crawling the list, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=425.84s)]
*  It's shtick. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=429.56s)]
*  But again, there's no shtick here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=430.76s)]
*  Trump wants it to be policy very clearly. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  He said it all throughout his presidency. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=434.67999999999995s)]
*  He said it afterwards and he said as much on the campaign trail this month. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=436.84s)]
*  We will completely overhaul Kamala's corrupt Department of Injustice and turn the Injustice [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=441.98s)]
*  Department back into the best law enforcement agency on the planet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=448.02000000000004s)]
*  Guess who reposted that clip of Trump on social media? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=453.54s)]
*  Mike Davis did. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=457.14000000000004s)]
*  The single word of comment. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  Amen. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=460.02000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is promising to destroy the federal justice system and the Justice Department [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=461.38s)]
*  so that he could wield it like a weapon to fit his political needs. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=468.86s)]
*  And he's got help thanks to the John Roberts authored Supreme Court immunity decision, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=473.62s)]
*  which goes out of his way to basically tell Trump, yeah, have that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=478.86s)]
*  He would have carte blanche to do it as part of his official duties. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=483.02000000000004s)]
*  Call the Justice Department, say no, don't indict that guy, indict that guy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=486.34000000000003s)]
*  Think Joe Biden's doing that? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  So I, for one, am grateful, weird as it is for today's indictment and the signal that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=493.26000000000005s)]
*  it sends. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=497.9s)]
*  The rule of law still holds up for now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypihgKBNdqw&t=499.73999999999995s)]
