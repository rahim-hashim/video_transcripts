# Hayes Trump’s main legal defense strategy? Winning in 2024.
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc)
*  There's a lot of expectation that Judge Cannon, just based on that first ruling, will bend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=0.0s)]
*  over backwards to do what is in Trump's interest. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=5.76s)]
*  In this case, that would appear to be slowing things down. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=7.88s)]
*  Because here's the thing, if the trial delays long enough, Donald Trump can convert what [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=11.52s)]
*  is a trial in a court of law into a literal trial of public opinion. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=16.04s)]
*  It's important to note here that all these criminal investigations into Donald Trump, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=22.56s)]
*  from Jack Smith's classified documents case and January 6th case to Georgia's investigation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=25.96s)]
*  of the Georgia election scheme and the New York indictment over hush money payments. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  All of those investigations and cases were launched before Donald Trump declared himself [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=37.4s)]
*  a candidate for president. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=41.72s)]
*  In fact, we know from reporting that Trump actually moved up the declaration of his candidacy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=43.28s)]
*  precisely so that he could then claim he was being politically persecuted if indicted. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=49.28s)]
*  You see how that works? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=55.44s)]
*  So his plan from the beginning and now is to try to win the presidency so that chief [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=57.16s)]
*  among any other goal, honestly, he doesn't go to jail, he can be above the law, and he [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=61.96s)]
*  can drop the cases against him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  And even if he does not have a fair trial, this case is likely going to take a while [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=70.72s)]
*  to get to trial. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=74.64s)]
*  Which prompts the question, what happens with Jack Smith's other criminal investigation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  into the ex-presidents efforts to subvert democracy and incite a violent insurrection? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=81.36s)]
*  That investigation is ongoing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  It's not showing signs of slowing down. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=87.88s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, the same day Donald Trump's getting arraigned in a federal courthouse [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=89.28s)]
*  in Miami, two Nevada fake electors were spotted entering the federal courthouse in Washington, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=93.56s)]
*  D.C. where the federal grand jury meets for that investigation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  And then of course, there's Fulton County in Georgia where district attorney Fonny Willis [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  is investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in her [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  state of Georgia. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  We are expecting a charging decision in that matter to come in a matter of weeks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=113.5s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, there was a question as to whether her investigation would be delayed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=119.16s)]
*  because of Trump's federal indictment. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  Today, her office put out a statement quickly shutting down that idea saying the federal [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=124.44s)]
*  indictments, plural, will not have any impact on their investigation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=129.08s)]
*  And get this, you may have caught this detail. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=133.96s)]
*  Yesterday, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said they sent personnel to Miami to sort [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=135.44s)]
*  of take in the scene and to prepare for a possible Trump indictment in their state, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=140.84s)]
*  which would seem to indicate they're expecting an indictment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=146.4s)]
*  But if the classified documents trial is delayed, I think honestly, just looking at the odds [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  and looking at the timeline and looking at the calendar, the most likely outcome is that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=156.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's not going to be tried before Election Day in 2024. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=160.88s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong, but that seems most likely. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=163.76s)]
*  And so then voters are going to have to make a determination about this man's suitability [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  for the highest office in the land and whether he is above the law. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  And if that's the case, which again appears likely, it becomes even more imperative that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  the ex-president is charged and tried for his gravest crime that he committed, his attempt [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  to end American democracy as we know it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-prTezd9-cc&t=185.95999999999998s)]
