# 'Terrible consequences' New bill would grant Trump a ‘frequent tool of dictators’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y)
*  Last week, the man you saw there, that's Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas, warned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  his colleagues about the danger of passing H.R. 9495, that is the Stop Terror Financing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=5.08s)]
*  and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=11.06s)]
*  Now, one of its purposes, as you see in the second part of that name, is to provide tax [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=13.84s)]
*  relief to Americans held hostage abroad. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=17.54s)]
*  Seems like a good idea. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  But it would also give the U.S. Treasury unilateral authority to strip tax-exempt status from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=22.42s)]
*  non-profits, which would essentially kill them off, that were deemed terrorist-supporting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=28.8s)]
*  organizations by the administration or, in just a few short months, the Trump administration, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=33.6s)]
*  which will be running the Treasury Department. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=39.52s)]
*  That would put over 100 organizations like the ACLU and the Brenner Center for Justice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=42.56s)]
*  even Planned Parenthood at risk. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=46.44s)]
*  The bill was blocked last week, falling short of the 270 votes needed to pass, but 52 Democrats [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=48.92s)]
*  had voted for it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=55.28s)]
*  And now the bill is heading back to the floor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  If it passes this time, it would have terrible consequences. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  As Democratic Senator Chris Murphy warns, a frequent tool of dictators is to label political [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  opposition groups as terrorist groups and shut them down. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  This bill would give Trump the power to do just that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  It's disastrous. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=72.24s)]
*  The vote is slated for this week. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=74.0s)]
*  And if you want to let your congressperson know your thoughts about how they should vote [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=75.4s)]
*  on it, call the House switchboard at 202-224-3121. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=78.6s)]
*  An operator will connect you with your representative. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=81.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett from Texas. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=85.64s)]
*  He's a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Congressional [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=88.04s)]
*  Joint Committee on Taxation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=91.04s)]
*  Congressman, I'm struggling a little bit with this legislation because it strikes me as [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=92.76s)]
*  it's probably already illegal under U.S. law to like materially support terrorism. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=101.04s)]
*  And so that has to already be illegal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, like, what's the purpose of the law? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=110.52s)]
*  Well, Chris, thank you. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=113.96s)]
*  I think you summarized it very well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=116.4s)]
*  The purpose of the law is to empower a wannabe tyrant with the weapons of tyranny. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=118.4s)]
*  And if Donald Trump is permitted to be judge, jury, and executioner over any nonprofit in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=125.04s)]
*  America that makes his enemies list, whether it's a hospital or a parenthood performing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=130.44s)]
*  an abortion, a group that is helping immigrants, eco-terrorists, as some have mislabeled, some [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=136.44s)]
*  environmental activists, or just people that don't hum MAGA enough, he has the power to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=143.56s)]
*  basically invalidate their nonprofit status, scare off their donors, and really do the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=150.0s)]
*  same kind of thing that, as you mentioned, my friend Chris Murphy said, the dictators, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=156.16s)]
*  the tyrants that Trump admires all over the world, they have squashed civic society in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=161.52s)]
*  order to prevent any kind of alternative voice. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  Even the news media, so many of our news media outlets now are nonprofit entities, certainly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=171.28s)]
*  down in Texas where I'm from, but major nonprofit organizations, and that's why the Freedom [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=177.12s)]
*  of the Press Foundation has gotten involved in this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  And we're now up, in fact, actually, to about 160 nonprofits that are calling on their members [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=186.0s)]
*  of Congress to not give this power to Donald Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=191.24s)]
*  I want to read from Claudia Tenney, who's one of the co-sponsors of the bill, just because [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  I feel like I should introduce what she says about her bill and have you respond to it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=200.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=204.44s)]
*  She starts about the tax penalties, but this is from a few posts. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=205.44s)]
*  She says, my bill is straightforward. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=208.56s)]
*  Tax-exempt nonprofits should not fund terrorist groups. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=210.8s)]
*  It's extremely alarming some House Democrats voted against this bill defending organizations [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=214.52s)]
*  that support terrorists, some of which are holding Americans hostage. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=218.4s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=222.2s)]
*  Well, we're all against terrorism and we're all for giving support for hostages so that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=224.84s)]
*  they don't pay any tax penalty. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=229.64s)]
*  This bill is not about terrorism. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  It's about giving Donald Trump unlimited authority to label his political opponents as terrorists [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  and thereby deny their nonprofit status. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=240.2s)]
*  I think the law is already perfectly adequate to deal with terrorism and the Justice Department [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=243.0s)]
*  has in fact prosecuted some people for funding terrorism in the past and has stopped some [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=248.28s)]
*  of that funding in the past. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=253.92s)]
*  It was clear in the course of the debate that the complaint was that the IRS had not moved [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=255.68s)]
*  swiftly enough concerning some of the letters the chairman had sent out to them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=261.4s)]
*  He's trying to litigate the tragedy in Gaza and the Middle East. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=267.28s)]
*  This is about much more than that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=273.1s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things from this might be wonky and processy, but it's worth getting [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=275.28s)]
*  to the weeds here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=279.55999999999995s)]
*  My understanding and I just reread the bill text today is that first of all, I don't think [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=280.55999999999995s)]
*  this is constitutional, but who knows the Supreme Court. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=284.88s)]
*  So let's just put that aside. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  It empowers the secretary of the Treasury to simply deem like that's the full process [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  here that the secretary of the Treasury just deems it organization like that's it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  Like the process is this cabinet secretary says you, Planned Parenthood, you're done [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=300.96s)]
*  because you're supporting terrorists. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=307.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  As some of Trump's extremist supporters claim Planned Parenthood as important and valuable [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=312.0s)]
*  as it is, they claim it's a terrorist organization. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=316.88s)]
*  And you mentioned the secretary of Treasury, that's how he does it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=320.28s)]
*  But we're seeing with these outrageous Trump appointments that you've been focusing on [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=323.4s)]
*  your program that this will really be Donald Trump personally. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  All he does is pick up the phone and say, I've had enough of Planned Parenthood. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=331.12s)]
*  I've had enough of the Sierra Club. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=334.76s)]
*  I've had enough of this hospital that's performing abortions. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  Declare that they're a terrorist. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=340.32s)]
*  They don't have to provide the reasons. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  They don't have to provide the evidence. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  They don't have to provide a meaningful hearing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=344.8s)]
*  And they're gone. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's why I think there is such a clamor about this from civic society across America [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  and why, as I've talked with colleagues, many of them today, the vote was taken last week [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=353.64s)]
*  really as they were just about getting off the plane following the election. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=358.32s)]
*  And many of these people are switching. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  But we do need the calls to our colleagues to ensure that come Thursday morning when [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  this bill is up, that we have a united democratic front against it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=368.84s)]
*  Now there is, the first time the vote came up, I believe it was done on what's called [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  suspension of the rules, which is a way of fast tracking a floor vote that has a higher [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  threshold. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=383.88s)]
*  I think it's two thirds, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=384.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=386.88s)]
*  And that's how we were able to stop it last week. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=387.88s)]
*  So are they going to bring it up on suspension again? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=390.32s)]
*  No, this is under a majority. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=393.56s)]
*  It's under what's called a rule that you're familiar with. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=396.96s)]
*  So we'll have an hour of debate on Thursday morning and a majority will determine this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=399.76s)]
*  To those people who say, well, the Senate will work out everything, I think it's very [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=404.84000000000003s)]
*  important that we have a substantial vote in the House. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=410.08s)]
*  The danger here is not just capital punishment on nonprofits across America, but the intimidation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=413.64s)]
*  fact that if Trump indicates, if you don't do this, your nonprofit status will be invalidated. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=420.68s)]
*  And that can have a very pernicious effect. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=427.48s)]
*  So I think we have a chance of slowing it down, not being just a speed bump on the way [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=430.7s)]
*  to an authoritarian government. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  And we have to, at every opportunity, when Trump is overreaching, we have to push back [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=438.7s)]
*  and not just be a yield right of way for his erroneous endeavors. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=443.74s)]
*  Congressman Lloyd Doggett, thank you, sir. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=449.62s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=450.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfMEzvsI0Y&t=460.7s)]
