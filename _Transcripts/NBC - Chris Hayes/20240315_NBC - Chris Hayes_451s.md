# Trump VP contenders compete for who can 'debase themselves most intensely'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll say what you will about Mike Pence, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=2.0s)]
*  and we have here on this program. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=3.84s)]
*  His politics and his pandering are terrible. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=5.3s)]
*  He went along with all of the awful policy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=7.48s)]
*  the Trump administration told most of the same lies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=9.8s)]
*  And even during COVID, Pence could always be seen [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=12.48s)]
*  gazing in admiration at the boss man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=14.6s)]
*  But the one good thing that he did in public life [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=17.36s)]
*  was refusing to sign on to Trump's attempted coup. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=20.18s)]
*  And today we learned he is not on board [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=23.44s)]
*  with coup part two either. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=25.8s)]
*  Will you be endorsing your former president? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=29.24s)]
*  You were on the ticket with him last time around. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, Martha, I appreciate the question. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=36.44s)]
*  And it should come as no surprise [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=39.2s)]
*  that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=40.96s)]
*  I mean, it comes as something of a surprise, to be honest. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=44.32s)]
*  All it takes to break the cycle of servility [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  is surviving a violent Trump mob [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=50.32s)]
*  that had a noose in gallows, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=51.84s)]
*  literally yelling they wanted to hang you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  But despite the risk to life and limb [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=56.04s)]
*  and to American democracy, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=57.84s)]
*  there are still lots of people ready [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=59.24s)]
*  to throw their neck in the ring, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  falling all over themselves to join Donald Trump's ticket. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Various names came up. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=66.16s)]
*  One of them was, of course, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=68.88000000000001s)]
*  He's made a big splash. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=70.88000000000001s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, who's making an appearance today [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=72.12s)]
*  in South Carolina, we just found out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=75.4s)]
*  Obviously, Tim Scott, Byron Donalds, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=77.56s)]
*  and a big presence here for Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=79.88s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  And Kristi Noem, as well, I should say. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=86.48s)]
*  Are they all on your short list? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=89.72s)]
*  Yeah, sure, whatever. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=93.84s)]
*  I'm gonna go out on a limb here [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=95.24s)]
*  and say it's not gonna be Ron DeSantis. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=96.36s)]
*  But lots of those names and others are circulating. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=98.28s)]
*  Lots of them know that Donald Trump does nothing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=100.6s)]
*  but watch TV all day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=103.0s)]
*  So you're getting a very perverse competition [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=104.36s)]
*  taking place right now on right-wing airwaves [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=106.96s)]
*  and social media. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Although you can apparently take it too far. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=110.52s)]
*  One contender until last week [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=113.0s)]
*  was Alabama Senator Katie Britt. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=114.72s)]
*  But her bizarre, widely panned, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=116.76s)]
*  and completely debunked State of the Union response [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=118.8s)]
*  seemed to earn her more points with comedy writers [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=121.28s)]
*  than with voters or with the Trump team. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=124.0s)]
*  So let's focus here on those that have bent over backwards [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=126.8s)]
*  to kiss the MAGA ring. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=129.56s)]
*  So you have to begin with South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=131.16s)]
*  mentioned there by Laura Ingraham, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=133.84s)]
*  who's been at this for a while. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=135.2s)]
*  It started last April when Scott was testing the waters [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=136.96s)]
*  for a presidential run. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=139.64s)]
*  I'm announcing today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=141.96s)]
*  That I'm running for president of the United States [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  of America! [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=153.4s)]
*  Hello, North Charleston! [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=156.12s)]
*  But when I go back to Iowa, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=158.96s)]
*  it will not be as a presidential candidate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  I am suspending my campaign. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  Didn't last that long. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=167.88s)]
*  Since leaving the race in November, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  Scott has had a very busy couple of months [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  finding what he says was the love of his life at church [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=172.56s)]
*  and proposing to her on the beach with a photographer in tow, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=175.76s)]
*  something even Trump remarked on as only Trump can. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=180.24s)]
*  Today was a big story, the biggest story out there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=184.28s)]
*  He's engaged to be married. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=186.96s)]
*  We never thought this was going to happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=191.52s)]
*  We never thought this was going to happen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=193.44s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=195.04s)]
*  If you win the Trump Feast-takes competition [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=196.52s)]
*  by debasing yourself the most intensely, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=199.24s)]
*  well then Tim Scott has the inside track. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=201.68s)]
*  Here was his audition tape just last night on Fox. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=203.56s)]
*  If there's anyone paying attention to the details of 2024, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  it's Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  He understands that the devil's in the details. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=212.32s)]
*  So he puts his brilliant daughter-in-law [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=215.8s)]
*  in charge of our RNC apparatus [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=218.28s)]
*  so that all that Rice talked about, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=221.28s)]
*  wise, wise man he is, will be taken care of. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=223.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, you want the ball in the hands [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=226.8s)]
*  of the best player on the field. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=231.04s)]
*  That player is Donald Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  I love everything about that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=235.4s)]
*  The idea that he's just like details obsessed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=240.2s)]
*  You need a guy who's details a test. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=242.32s)]
*  It's not just Scott though. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=244.76s)]
*  There are other senators in contention too, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=245.84s)]
*  like JD Vance of Ohio, who was pretty unequivocal [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=248.12s)]
*  in calling himself a Never Trumper for a long time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  Now Vance is campaigning for Trump, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=253.64s)]
*  says the former president has changed his mind. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  So much so that Vance would never have pulled [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=257.56s)]
*  Mike Pence's VP. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=260.6s)]
*  Would you have certified the election results [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=262.84s)]
*  had you been vice president? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=264.48s)]
*  If I had been vice president, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=267.36s)]
*  I would have told the states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=268.72s)]
*  and so many others that we needed to have [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=271.48s)]
*  multiple slates of electors. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=273.56s)]
*  And I think the US Congress [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=275.2s)]
*  should have fought over it from there. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=276.4s)]
*  Fought over it, fought over it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=278.44s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=280.52s)]
*  Can't you imagine how great that would have been [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=281.56s)]
*  if they fought over it from there? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=283.04s)]
*  Of course, despite that, neither Vance nor Trump, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=285.36s)]
*  maybe, or Scott, maybe Trump's pick. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=287.32s)]
*  The conventional wisdom right now [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=289.68s)]
*  suggests that Trump might be looking to court women voters [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=291.72s)]
*  by putting one on his ticket. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=294.24s)]
*  Trump says he likes the concept, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=296.16s)]
*  which brings us to South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=298.2s)]
*  She had her eyes on the prize from the very beginning, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=301.36s)]
*  so much so she did not even try to run for president. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=303.2s)]
*  Her endorsement of Trump last September [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=306.56s)]
*  set off a flurry of running mate speculation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=308.52s)]
*  And in fact, you remember that she ran ads [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=310.92s)]
*  during the presidential debates for herself. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=313.44s)]
*  South Dakota stayed open for business during the pandemic. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=317.44s)]
*  Now we've got more jobs than people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=320.56s)]
*  So I'm filling in until you get here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=323.2s)]
*  South Dakota's the freest state in America. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=325.96s)]
*  South Dakota, freedom works here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=327.92s)]
*  Now, that aired in a year in which Noem was not standing [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=331.2s)]
*  for any election during a Republican debate [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=333.8s)]
*  that she was not participating in, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  but that Donald Trump might have been watching. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=338.28s)]
*  I mean, he certainly isn't moving to South Dakota, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=340.52s)]
*  but he is looking for a vice president. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=342.32s)]
*  Noem has been very obviously auditioning for this role, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  but in a strange turn, it appears that Noem is endorsing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  a Texas dentist on social media, doing ads like this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=351.64s)]
*  Well, hi, I'm Kristi Noem. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm the governor of South Dakota [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=358.8s)]
*  and had the opportunity to come to Smile, Texas [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=360.36s)]
*  to fix my teeth. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that I chose the team here at Smile, Texas [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=364.36s)]
*  because they're the best. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=368.0s)]
*  I love that my bite is better. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=369.48s)]
*  Great, good for you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=372.6s)]
*  Noem is now being sued by a consumer group [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=375.0s)]
*  for not disclosing a financial relationship [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=376.12s)]
*  with that dentistry company. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  Fresh off that, it appears that Noem posted this ad [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=379.48s)]
*  for custom insoles for your shoes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  We are at Fit My Feet in Rapid City [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  and these guys are amazing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  They have totally built me inserts for running, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=389.0s)]
*  separate ones for my cowboy boots. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=391.6s)]
*  I'm gonna be perfect. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna be like Bionic Woman now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=395.48s)]
*  I mean, I like insoles as much as the next guy, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=398.24s)]
*  but I will say at least that company is in her state. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=401.32s)]
*  So it makes a little more sense. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=404.64s)]
*  Not exactly vice presidential, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=406.12s)]
*  unless you're an ex-president [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  who's constantly grifting the public, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=409.4s)]
*  trading on your notoriety in a ceaseless sales pitch, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=410.84s)]
*  constantly trying to get people to yes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=413.92s)]
*  Donald Trump has got a lot of yes men and women [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=416.36s)]
*  vying for his attention. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=418.48s)]
*  But as we learned with Mike Pence, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=419.48s)]
*  it really matters who he picks. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=421.56s)]
*  It matters who the vice president could be, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=423.36s)]
*  especially if the president is going to demand [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=425.32s)]
*  you help end democracy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEfLg-mkTY&t=427.88s)]
