# 'Failure' Raskin on missing GOP ‘informant’ turning out to be fugitive
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk)
*  He's very credible and the people on MSNBC who made fun of me when I said we had an informant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=0.0s)]
*  that was missing, they should feel like fools right now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=7.08s)]
*  And this is their worst nightmare because again, this is a credible witness that the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=9.72s)]
*  FBI flew all the way to Brussels to interview and sent several agents to interview. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=15.72s)]
*  Recapping the news, James Comer's big witness is missing because he's running from the law. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=22.44s)]
*  He is a literal fugitive from justice. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=28.28s)]
*  Gal Luft, a dual US-Israeli citizen, is also facing charges for arms trafficking, violating [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=31.0s)]
*  sanctions against Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  He has been indicted for being an unregistered agent of the Chinese state. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Here's the thing, he was arrested in Cyprus back in February and then subsequently fled [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  and remains a fugitive. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Okay, so what happens now to the Republican stunt to take down the Biden administration? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=49.24s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland is the ranking member of the oversight [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=54.16s)]
*  committee that James Comer is currently the chair of and he joins me now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=58.08s)]
*  It's good to have you Congressman Raskin. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=62.0s)]
*  What do you make of all of this? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=64.8s)]
*  Well this was going to be the big mystery whistleblower witness who was finally going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=68.24s)]
*  to redeem the last six months of wasted effort and failures in Republican investigations [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=74.2s)]
*  on the oversight committee. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=82.28s)]
*  And suddenly the whole country knows now the reason he was missing is because he's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=84.2s)]
*  a fugitive from the US government fleeing these charges of making false statements, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=89.56s)]
*  being an arms trafficker trying to set up this Chinese arms for Iranian oil deal, and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=97.72s)]
*  failing to register as a foreign agent and a series of multiple felonies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=107.08s)]
*  And it's extraordinary to me as I was leaving the Capitol this evening to learn that my [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=115.8s)]
*  colleagues rather than simply going home and trying to ride out the Newsday are doubling [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=120.72s)]
*  down now and saying that the Department of Justice is going after him because of the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=127.12s)]
*  wealth of information that he presumably has to give them about I don't know what [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=132.52s)]
*  their previous failed efforts at getting Joe Biden, the suspicious activities reports [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  that went nowhere and revealed nothing on Biden or their form 1023, which also exploded [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=144.28s)]
*  their allegations of bribery about Biden because it turned out to be the same recycled Giuliani [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  stuff that was rejected by Donald Trump's own US attorney in the Western District of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=157.86s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=163.06s)]
*  So none of it's leading anywhere. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=164.06s)]
*  And yet they're continuing to dive back in like the cult members they've become. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=165.46s)]
*  Well, I just want to be clear on that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=169.78s)]
*  So my understanding is this indictment with the indictment happened last November. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=172.02s)]
*  So it happened nine months ago, somewhere around there, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=176.58s)]
*  Eight or nine months ago. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=179.86s)]
*  Then he's apprehended in Cyprus in February. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=181.66000000000003s)]
*  Then he jumps bail. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=183.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he escapes, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=184.78000000000003s)]
*  So now it's like a little bit of like the mini Trump thing where Trump's like, I declare [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=187.06s)]
*  for the presidency and now if you indict me, I'm being persecuted. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=190.72s)]
*  It seems like a little bit of like he puts out this video being like they're coming after [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=194.08s)]
*  me for my wealth of information. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=197.84s)]
*  Well knowing that he's been indicted by the government for stuff he's done. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Like it seems like maybe the Occam's razor here is he's trying to use this as a shield [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=204.32s)]
*  to protect himself from, you know, being brought to justice. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=208.8s)]
*  Well, you got it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=212.32s)]
*  I think Gal Luft wants to use the Republican Party exactly the same way that Donald Trump [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=214.2s)]
*  is using the Republican Party as a shield from criminal investigation and prosecution [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  for accountability for his actions. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=224.16s)]
*  The same way that George Santos wants to use the Republican Party as an effort to essentially [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=225.76s)]
*  launder all of his crimes and all of his money. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=232.04s)]
*  It's the exact same thing with this guy, but he's using the House Oversight Committee for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=234.2s)]
*  those purposes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=238.88s)]
*  Now, I want to talk about another allegation here, which I think is another thing that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=240.88s)]
*  Comer has pursued, which to me has a higher degree of credibility because there's a named [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=245.64s)]
*  individual in it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=250.84s)]
*  There is an IRS whistleblower who we know actually worked the IRS who has filed a whistleblower [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=251.84s)]
*  complaint and he has alleged that there was political interference that happened from [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  the Department of Justice, other U.S. attorneys and maybe Merrick Garland as regards to the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=260.32s)]
*  Hunter Biden case and that David Weiss, the Trump appointed prosecutor who oversaw that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=264.52s)]
*  case was not allowed to pursue the case in the ways he wanted to. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  That's the allegation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=275.12s)]
*  I think it's a more serious allegation because there's like a real actual person there who's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  actually gone. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  So there's now a letter from Weiss basically knocking this down to Lindsey Graham and saying, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=282.96s)]
*  no, this is all nonsense. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  Where do you come down on it? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=291.0s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  And of course, Weiss is Donald Trump's U.S. attorney, but he's a United States attorney [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  for the Department of Justice. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=302.76s)]
*  And you know, those would be serious allegations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=305.0s)]
*  But there's a process for going through determining whether or not they're true. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  Weiss rejects them and denies them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=312.76s)]
*  But really what we see is a grasping at straws, an attempt to find something, anything to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=315.24s)]
*  get at Joe Biden. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=323.24s)]
*  And why? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  Because it's a massive distraction from the fact that Donald Trump had one overriding [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  purpose in being in office and one overriding purpose in coming back into office. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=331.48s)]
*  He had a money making operation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  He converted the presidency into an instrument of profit maximization for himself and his [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=338.2s)]
*  family. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  And he wants to keep this grift going. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  So there's got to be an effort to bring down Joe Biden by putting him in the same category, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=347.12s)]
*  which is ridiculous. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=352.48s)]
*  And it's not convincing to the American people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=354.48s)]
*  Quickly and finally, Ben Cardin, who is the senator from your state, has announced he [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=356.4s)]
*  will not be seeking reelection. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=361.56s)]
*  There are folks looking to throw their hat in the ring. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=363.88s)]
*  You made the decision this week that you will not run for Senate. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=367.24s)]
*  Why did you make that decision? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=369.76s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm not throwing my bandana in the ring at this point because we're look, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=371.48s)]
*  We're still in the thick of this fight to defend American democracy and democratic institutions [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  against the autocrats and the theocrats and the kleptocrats like Donald Trump. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=386.8s)]
*  And I'm exactly where I need to be as the ranking Democrat at the Oversight Committee. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  And when we win the House back in 2024, and we will, I will be the chair of the Oversight [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=397.32s)]
*  Committee. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=401.88s)]
*  And I want to see this through. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=403.0s)]
*  And I want to make sure that we're going to win the House back. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to be going all across the country to campaign for fellow Democrats. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=408.8s)]
*  And I'd rather be campaigning for Democrats across America than against fellow Democrats [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  in Maryland. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  And so, you know, that's the judgment that I've made at this point. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Ld9xG6sRk&t=419.32000000000005s)]
