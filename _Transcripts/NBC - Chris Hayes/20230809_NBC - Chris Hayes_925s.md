# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 8
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8)
*  Today in the dog days of August, it was election day in Ohio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=0.0s)]
*  And that is thanks to state Republicans who earlier this year hastily changed their own laws [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=4.0s)]
*  to shove a special election onto the calendar during a time of year Republicans themselves know typically see low turnout. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=9.0s)]
*  It was a desperate, transparent attempt to stop Ohio voters from being able to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution this fall. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=16.0s)]
*  You see, the ballot measure being voted on today, known as issue one, would raise the threshold to amend the state constitution [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=25.0s)]
*  from a simple majority vote, which it's been for over a century, to 60 percent. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=31.0s)]
*  And it would come just in time to make it that much more difficult for what they should they know will be a big showdown in the fall. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=35.0s)]
*  That's when Ohio voters will have a chance to pass a constitutional amendment that would secure abortion rights in the state. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=41.0s)]
*  Basically, Ohio Republicans want to raise the threshold to 60 percent for that vote because they think they're going to lose it otherwise. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=48.0s)]
*  Progressives and abortion rights activists, along with all sorts of good government groups, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=56.0s)]
*  including quite a few former Republican officials, current Republican officials, have all rallied against issue one. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=60.0s)]
*  Right now, according to the Secretary of State's tally, the no vote is enjoying an overwhelming lead. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=66.0s)]
*  With about two-thirds of the vote at this hour, we are waiting for the Associated Press to make a projection. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=72.0s)]
*  But the Columbus Dispatch newspaper has already tonight made their call that issue one has failed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=77.0s)]
*  Jen Miller is the executive director of the Ohio League of Women Voters, part of the coalition leading the charge against issue one. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=83.0s)]
*  David Pepper, the former chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, author of Saving Democracy, a user's manual for every American. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=90.0s)]
*  And both join me now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=97.0s)]
*  Jen, first, tell me about the messaging, the organizing, the motivation around this, because at some level it's somewhat abstract procedural issue. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=99.0s)]
*  But one thing that is clear, independent of the outcome, was there was enormous turnout. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=108.0s)]
*  This was very, very much an issue front of mind for voters, despite the fact it happened the first week of August. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had a neighbor to neighbor campaign where every day Ohioans got out and they knocked on doors and they sent postcards and they made phone calls and sent texts. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=122.0s)]
*  And our strategy was simple, just to tell Ohio voters the truth, that our very freedoms were at stake here, that ballot issues are how we hold our government accountable when they're acting corrupt or they're not acting in our best interests. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=132.0s)]
*  And what we had was really a pan-partisan movement of Republicans, Democrats, independents, the libertarians, civic organizations, first responders, nurses, so many different groups of people coming together to defend our freedoms here in Ohio. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=149.0s)]
*  So it's a really exciting evening. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, those images you see are rally for the no side that was opposing this and they're sort of holding a victory party. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=167.0s)]
*  Again, we don't have a call yet from the AP. Columbus Dispatch has called it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=175.0s)]
*  David, you and I have talked about this and about the sort of transparent bad faith at play in the gerrymandered Republican legislature shoving this onto the ballot in August, hoping to forestall and change the threshold for that fall vote on abortion rights. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=179.0s)]
*  What is your takeaway from what we're seeing unfold here? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=193.0s)]
*  Well, obviously it didn't work. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=197.0s)]
*  The people saw through it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=198.0s)]
*  Ohioans have done this a few times before. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=199.0s)]
*  There was an attack 11 years ago or so on labor rights. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=202.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=205.0s)]
*  I think the no side was very organized. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=206.0s)]
*  It crossed every partisan divide. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=209.0s)]
*  And the yes side, I think, in the end, they really, in the end, to the broader point, they couldn't really hide the fact that, again, this was all about abortion in November. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=211.0s)]
*  And in the end, Ohio's a 60-40 state. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=220.0s)]
*  I think people saw this as a sneak attack. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=222.0s)]
*  And so those who care about abortion access showed up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=224.0s)]
*  But people far beyond that showed up and voted no, because it just seemed to be this shameless attack on democracy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=227.0s)]
*  People saw through it, showed up and obviously voted down early. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=233.0s)]
*  And my guess is we're going to see the early vote. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=237.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, the day of vote is pretty good for no as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=239.0s)]
*  You had it all up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=242.0s)]
*  And I think we have a nice win tonight for democracy, for abortion access. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=243.0s)]
*  And by the way, for the future of more reforms like ending gerrymandering that would have been cut out of the knees if this thing had passed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=246.0s)]
*  Jen, I've seen some people say, you know, independent of how this went down, maybe it should be the case that there's a higher threshold for a constitutional amendment for the state. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=253.0s)]
*  And I'm sure that in your communications with voters, maybe some people will raise that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=263.0s)]
*  What has been your argument about that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, some of the best policies that have been passed in Ohio have been done through constitutional amendments. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=270.0s)]
*  A lot of them did not pass by 60 percent. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=275.0s)]
*  Even things like integrating the Ohio National Guard did not pass by 60 percent. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=278.0s)]
*  And so we have been able to point out this beautiful track record that we have here in Ohio, where we've made our economy stronger, where we've extended rights, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=285.0s)]
*  where we've awarded pensions to war vets and raise the minimum wage. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=294.0s)]
*  All of these things are how we were able to talk to everyday people and get them to turn out and vote no. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=299.0s)]
*  Well, we have some breaking news. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=306.0s)]
*  The Associated Press has now called it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=308.0s)]
*  They have now called the race. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=310.0s)]
*  We can call that issue one in Ohio that would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments to 60 percent has gone down to a defeat, according to the Associated Press. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=311.0s)]
*  That's the news organization we're using to make the call. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=321.0s)]
*  A pretty stunning rebuke here. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=324.0s)]
*  Not unexpected given what we've seen in the last hour, but now we have it official, David. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=326.0s)]
*  I mean, this was a real there was some real hubris on the part of Republican lawmakers, the secretary of state of your state, the gerrymandered legislature to try to do this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=330.0s)]
*  Do you think there's lessons here? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=340.0s)]
*  Do you think they will get the message here? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=342.0s)]
*  And what is it set up for the fall? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=344.0s)]
*  They won't learn them. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=347.0s)]
*  This group, my worry, whenever they lose, they double down on their lawlessness. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=348.0s)]
*  This is already very gerrymandered legislature. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=352.0s)]
*  I don't expect them to learn any lessons. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=354.0s)]
*  But let me just the good news here is that this is part of a longer winning streak for democracy that started last August in Kansas, included some big statehouse wins in November. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=356.0s)]
*  The Wisconsin Supreme Court race. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=366.0s)]
*  There's a pro-democracy army building in this country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=368.0s)]
*  And it's starting to figure out that the front line of attack on democracy are the states in the statehouses. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=372.0s)]
*  And when it sees democracy under attack in these places, this included election denying running Secretary of State candidates, it's rallying around these races. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=378.0s)]
*  And so my sort of call out to those who are doing this, keep seeing the attack for democracy as a deeper level in the state level. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=386.0s)]
*  And if you rally like we've done in all these states for the last year, we can put together one heck of a winning streak long term. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=394.0s)]
*  But we've got to focus beyond just a few federal swing states into all these states where the other side is dominated for too long. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=400.0s)]
*  Take advantage of the fact that we haven't seen the battle there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=407.0s)]
*  When we rally and we pay attention, which we did here, we can win in Kansas, Ohio, Wisconsin, you name it, because in the end, most people in America want a functioning democracy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=410.0s)]
*  They don't want what the Republicans of Ohio are arrogantly trying to create here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should say we don't have the final results, but no tracking to come in. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=424.0s)]
*  Double digits above the numbers of say, Democratic state candidate in the 2020 election. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=428.0s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be a large margin, much higher. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=434.0s)]
*  And the other lesson strikes me here just that we've seen this time and time again. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=437.0s)]
*  The media focus may waver from time to time about abortion rights, but voters have shown themselves that they will crawl over broken glass coast to coast, state to state to repudiate the data. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=443.0s)]
*  The decision and the banning of abortion, the taking away of that right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=457.0s)]
*  It keeps happening. And I think it's going to keep happening a lot more tonight. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=462.0s)]
*  Another turning point that Jim Miller, David Pepper, thank you very much. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=464.0s)]
*  In many ways, Georgia is ground zero in the battle for American democracy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=469.0s)]
*  A true 50 50 state Biden's narrow win in 2020 was the first time a Democrat carried that state since Clinton. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=473.0s)]
*  The Biden victory inspired then President Trump to try and corruptly overturn the election in Georgia. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=480.0s)]
*  A scheme he was just invited for federally along the other states that he tried to do it and for which he faces another potential indictment this month in Georgia itself. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=485.0s)]
*  And while Trump's efforts failed, state Republicans were able to force through some of the most restrictive voter suppression rules in the country in the aftermath. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=494.0s)]
*  Additionally, Georgia has held three of the most hotly contested Senate races in the country in just two years with Democrats prevailing in all three races. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=502.0s)]
*  Thanks in large part to this man, Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won two of those races, actually really four of them when you count the runoffs in just two years. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=511.0s)]
*  And Senator Reverend Warnock joins me now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=521.0s)]
*  He is the author of the book A Way Out of No Way, A Memoir of Truth Transformation and the New American Story. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=524.0s)]
*  Senator, first, let's just start. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=530.0s)]
*  So in short, Fulton County, I believe, is where you call home and is the place where there may be some activity legally. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=532.0s)]
*  Fannie Willis has talked about the kind of threat she's gotten today. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=542.0s)]
*  The ex-president called her a racist. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=545.0s)]
*  Are you concerned at all about the atmosphere being directed at the machinery of justice in your home state? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=547.0s)]
*  Well, great to be with you, Chris. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=557.0s)]
*  We are watching the wills of jurisprudence turn here in the state of Georgia and in our country. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=559.0s)]
*  And I think it's important for everybody to honor that process. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=567.0s)]
*  The ex-president, sadly, is doing what we've seen him do time and time again. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=571.0s)]
*  I have confidence in our local officials here, and I'll be doing everything I can at the federal level to ensure that they have the resources necessary to keep everybody safe. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=575.0s)]
*  While we honor that basic American principle, equal protection under the law. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=587.0s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=591.0s)]
*  No one is below the law. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=592.0s)]
*  And that applies to the ex-president. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=594.0s)]
*  There has been a lot of scrutiny of Georgia, both its politics, because it has become such a hotly contested swing state. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=596.0s)]
*  It has had some of the highest profile races in the entire country, including the four races that you ran in the course of two years. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=603.0s)]
*  Actually, it was five, Chris, but who's counting? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=611.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=614.0s)]
*  So how would you rate the state's democratic health, having emerged victorious in the state, being the first black senator from that state? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=615.0s)]
*  How would you rate its democratic health? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=627.0s)]
*  Well, I'm honored that the people of Georgia have sent me to the United States Senate to represent them. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=630.0s)]
*  But make no mistake, we are in a real fight for our democracy here in this country. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=636.0s)]
*  And Georgia is ground zero. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=644.0s)]
*  And the fact that the people of Georgia overcame those barriers in order to send me and my partner, John Ossoff, to the Senate, doesn't mean those barriers don't exist. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=646.0s)]
*  It just means that the people refuse to have their voices muted in the system. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=659.0s)]
*  And so what we saw in the days after my election is the violent assault on the Capitol metastasized then into voter suppression laws all across our country throughout the body politic. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=663.0s)]
*  Some 400 voter suppression laws introduced in the year 2021, right after my election. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=679.0s)]
*  And then this year, some 300 voter suppression laws. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=687.0s)]
*  And Georgia's SB 202 is exhibit A, if you will, of the problem. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=691.0s)]
*  This effort to somehow wage war against this multiracial new American electorate that is emerging in our country and in our state. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=699.0s)]
*  And defending everything from voting rights to reproductive rights to ensuring that jobs and opportunity available to every kid, regardless of their zip code. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=710.0s)]
*  In terms of SB 202, I mean, I think people, the defenders of the law and some, I think, and not specifically people who are that keyed in say, look, you know, this was law passed with certain restrictions. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=721.0s)]
*  It got a lot of attention after January 6 because it was passed in 2021. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=734.0s)]
*  It was decried by critics as an attempt to voter suppression. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=738.0s)]
*  But look, you know, you got elected. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=743.0s)]
*  You know, elections are running well. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=747.0s)]
*  Were you crying wolf about this law? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=750.0s)]
*  Listen, I won this last time, but people need to understand what I had to go through the wind. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=754.0s)]
*  Just as we entered into the runoff this second time, there were some folks who clearly took a look at how we won in the last runoff. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=761.0s)]
*  They cut the runoff in half from eight weeks to four weeks. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=769.0s)]
*  And as we entered the runoff, the secretary of state and other Georgia officials announced that we wouldn't be able to vote on the first Saturday of the runoff. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=773.0s)]
*  And they were misinterpreting some Georgia law and saying we're sorry, our hands are tied. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=784.0s)]
*  You can't vote that first Saturday. Well, since they said their hands were tied, I decided to untie their hands. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=790.0s)]
*  I sued them and we won the case. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=795.0s)]
*  And then the folks who said their hands were tied then showed their hands and appealed the judge's ruling who said, yeah, you can vote on Saturday. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=798.0s)]
*  And then we had to appeal again. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=806.0s)]
*  All of that just so people could vote first Saturday of the runoff. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=808.0s)]
*  About 100,000 people voted that Saturday, which is about the margin of my win. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=811.0s)]
*  This is how voter suppression happens. This is how it works. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=816.0s)]
*  You don't need a tsunami. You just need to shave a few votes here, shave some there, make it difficult for people to use drop boxes, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=819.0s)]
*  ensure that African Americans stand in lines many times longer than their counterparts, which all of the data shows is true, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=827.0s)]
*  deal with issues around Sunday voting, weekend voting, and you get people turning democracy upside down rather than the people sending or choosing their representatives. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=838.0s)]
*  The representatives start choosing the people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=847.0s)]
*  And this is why this is why Congress must pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which we introduced a couple of weeks ago, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=850.0s)]
*  which provides a basic standard for voting to ensure that people have access to the franchise. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=857.0s)]
*  Nothing could be more important. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=865.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Freedom to Vote Act, which would create a kind of nationwide floor for voter access in some ways kind of patch up what has been eviscerated in the wake of the Shelby County decision by the Supreme Court, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=868.0s)]
*  which has has shot a lot of holes in the Voting Rights Act used to have the regime of preclearance. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=879.0s)]
*  Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock, thank you for joining us. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=884.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=887.0s)]
*  And I should say that you can listen to a much longer conversation between the Senator and myself on the latest episode of my podcast, Why Is This Happening? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=888.0s)]
*  We get through a lot of different issues, including his background, his experience in the Senate, and it is available now wherever you get your podcasts or you can scan the QR code on your screen. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=895.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IueWZLT8Ac8&t=917.0s)]
