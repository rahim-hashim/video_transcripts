# All In with Chris Hayes - Dec. 28  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE)
*  Good evening from Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jason Johnson. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=7.48s)]
*  And for Chris Hayes, as we approach the new year when the many legal troubles facing Donald [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=8.8s)]
*  Trump will come to a head, tonight, the ex-president has just lost access to the presidential ballot [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=13.46s)]
*  in a second state. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=18.68s)]
*  Secretary of State from Maine ruled that, quote, Donald J. Trump is not qualified to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  hold the office of president under section three of the 14th Amendment, which bars people [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=25.52s)]
*  who have engaged in insurrection from holding office. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=30.08s)]
*  Quote, the events of January 6, 2021, were unprecedented and tragic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=33.16s)]
*  And the evidence here demonstrates that they occurred at the behest of and with the knowledge [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  and support of the outgoing president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  She adds, quote, I am mindful that no secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=48.08s)]
*  of ballot access based on section three of the 14th Amendment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=53.52s)]
*  I am also mindful, however, that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in insurrection. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=57.6s)]
*  The Maine ruling comes just over a week after the Colorado State Supreme Court reached the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  same conclusions, barring Trump from the ballot there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=67.88s)]
*  For now, though, Trump remains on the ballot in both states, as the Maine secretary stayed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=71.44s)]
*  her decision pending a court review. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  And in Colorado, an appeal by the state Republican Party to the United States Supreme Court similarly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=78.64s)]
*  put hold, put the ruling on hold there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=83.4s)]
*  Supreme Court has yet to announce if it will take the case. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  But earlier today, the plaintiffs who brought the Colorado suit asked the court to move [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=89.36s)]
*  quickly on the matter, writing, quote, this case involves issues of exceptional national [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=93.64s)]
*  importance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=98.92s)]
*  Colorado, along with 15 other states and territories, holds its presidential primary on Super Tuesday, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=99.92s)]
*  March 5. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=105.72s)]
*  This motion seeks to expedite the court's consideration of this petition so that the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  important questions of Trump's eligibility can be resolved before most primary voters [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=111.56s)]
*  ask their ballots. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=117.12s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss, Joyce Vance is a former U.S. attorney for the Northern District [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=119.12s)]
*  of Alabama and is now a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=123.16s)]
*  Ellen Mistal is the Lewis Black of politics and the justice correspondent for the nation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=127.56s)]
*  Both join me now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=132.04s)]
*  I'm very excited to have you all start off the show. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=133.04s)]
*  Joyce, I'll start with this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=134.96s)]
*  have probably been pouring through the actual documentation here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=137.52s)]
*  What are the differences, I guess, perhaps in the laws being applied or the legal assumptions [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=142.16s)]
*  series? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=148.84s)]
*  Are there any differences between what we're seeing out of Maine and what we saw at Colorado? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=149.84s)]
*  Or are they both basically based on the same principles? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=157.36s)]
*  They're based on the 14th Amendment principle of eligibility. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=159.36s)]
*  But we do have this patchwork quilt now of different decisions in different states, which [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=163.94s)]
*  is why this will ultimately head to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=168.98s)]
*  Look, Jason, Maine is a little bit quirky. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  They have a different procedure than Colorado does and then Minnesota did. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=175.46s)]
*  They start with the secretary of state, which is why Shennebela has got the first crack [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=179.84s)]
*  at this decision. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=184.26s)]
*  It will now be appealed into Maine's superior court. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=185.74s)]
*  That is their trial level state court, and then it will make its way up to the Maine [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=188.92s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=193.54s)]
*  So this decision is far from final, but it's very well reasoned. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=194.54s)]
*  And we see the secretary of state in her concluding paragraph taking pains to clarify that her [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=198.64s)]
*  decision is not a political one, that is compelled by the extraordinarily unusual legal circumstances [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=204.54s)]
*  which come with Donald Trump's candidacy following an insurrection. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=212.2s)]
*  What is it going to matter? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=218.96s)]
*  Will it matter actually to the Supreme Court, appellate courts, federal courts, that this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=221.66s)]
*  decision is primarily out of a secretary of state's office as opposed to Colorado, where [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=226.74s)]
*  it's a decision that came from judges? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=230.92s)]
*  Is that going to matter to anyone since they're both sort of basing it off the same principles [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=233.4s)]
*  from the 14th Amendment? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=237.4s)]
*  I think it should matter because, and I want to be really clear about this, I would like, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=239.68s)]
*  listening Nikki Haley to like lean in and listen real close to what I'm about to say [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  because the Civil War was about slavery. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  But this right here, this, my friend, is about states' rights. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=252.76s)]
*  Like that's what's actually going on here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=257.36s)]
*  All the Maine secretary of state is saying is that she has the authority to protect the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=259.84s)]
*  integrity of the Maine ballot according to the laws of Maine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=264.14s)]
*  That is a straight up states' rights issue, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=269.2s)]
*  This is not really about the kind of larger federal concerns that some people want to bring into it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=272.52s)]
*  This is whether or not Maine or Colorado or Minnesota or Michigan or any of the other states [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=277.52s)]
*  have control over their ballot. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=283.32s)]
*  As I've said many times on this show and on others, we do not have one federal election system. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=285.44s)]
*  We have 50 federal election systems all determined by each individual state. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=291.52s)]
*  Now, frankly, I don't like it that way. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd rather have just one system. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=300.0s)]
*  But Republicans have determined and demanded that we have a 50 state solution to every, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=302.84s)]
*  where every state has to have their own election rules. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  The Maine secretary of state is applying Maine's election rules to the Maine ballot. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=312.56s)]
*  Republicans should love this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=317.88s)]
*  Joyce, this is something else that's sort of interesting. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=319.88s)]
*  If everyone is going to base this sort of off the 14th Amendment, what do you see as [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  being the future of some of these other rulings? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=329.96s)]
*  I mean, are all the other states basically going to copy and paste everybody else's homework [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=333.32s)]
*  and then bring it to the Supreme Court and say, are you going to fail us all? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  How is this going to, how does both Colorado and Maine and now future states where this is being [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=340.12s)]
*  legislated, where this is being argued about, how do you think this is going to have an impact? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=346.28s)]
*  Yes, so Eli is right when he talks about the different elections that are conducted in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=351.0s)]
*  different states, each with their own state laws, their own procedures. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=355.64s)]
*  There's this one little carve out niche when it comes to qualifications for a president of the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=359.56s)]
*  United States, which are established in various parts of the constitution. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=364.6s)]
*  You have to be 35. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=368.68s)]
*  You have to be a native born citizen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=370.12s)]
*  And when we get to the 14th Amendment, we learn that you also cannot have participated in an [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=372.44s)]
*  insurrection after previously taking an oath to uphold the constitution. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  So because that is an area of federal eligibility and qualification, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=382.68s)]
*  it's appropriate for the Supreme Court to step in and weigh in on the law. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=387.4s)]
*  But the difficulty here, and Jason, this is something that you've discussed before, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=391.88s)]
*  is less so the very clear legal dictates in the law, but the intersection of politics and law here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=396.52s)]
*  And the court, I think, will implicitly have to make a decision about whether they're willing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=403.32s)]
*  to run the risk of following the strict letter of the law, which this Supreme Court is on record [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  as saying it must do when it's unambiguous, or whether there are concerns about how Americans [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=413.72s)]
*  will react and their ability to accept the results if a candidate is removed from the ballot rather [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=419.24s)]
*  than letting the voters make the choice. Now, Ellie, I want to take this to you because this [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=425.0s)]
*  is something that I've talked about a lot and philosophically it matters to me. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=430.68s)]
*  Generally speaking, I think that the final decision as to whether somebody should be in office should [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=435.72s)]
*  be decided by the voters. The only time I can imagine that this shouldn't be a decision placed [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=440.52s)]
*  in the hand of the voters is when the person who they're potentially voting on has made it a point [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  to say, I will not respect the results of any election and I will attempt to rig them. At what [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=450.52s)]
*  point does that become something that the Supreme Court has to answer? Because whether or not Donald [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=455.96s)]
*  Trump has been convicted of insurrection, whether or not we have any sort of legal examples, whether [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=463.0s)]
*  he's gone to jail, whether he's been in an orange jump or something like that, the man has said very [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=469.24s)]
*  clearly, I won't respect any result that's not the way I want it to. Shouldn't that play a role in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=472.92s)]
*  how quickly the court gets to this? Yeah, look, if you can't defend yourself from a person who tried [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=478.44s)]
*  to overthrow your government, then what good is the rule of law? Like, that's really where we're at [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=484.68s)]
*  here. Like, I totally agree with you kind of philosophically, political philosophy-wise, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=490.44s)]
*  we want elections to matter, we want democracy to work, and it is weird, it is tricky, it is [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  squeamish, it is uncomfortable to remove a democratic choice from the voters in the name of saving [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=501.32s)]
*  democracy. I understand that tension and I have to live with that tension. But if we're looking at [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=508.28s)]
*  protecting democracy, then certainly we have to look at protecting ourselves from people who try [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=515.88s)]
*  to overthrow that democracy. Let us not forget that in recent world history and general world [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=521.96s)]
*  history, most dictators are elected the first time, right? Most dictators have some kind of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=529.24s)]
*  election go their way the first time. It's what happens when there tries to be a future election [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  that the dictators show their true colors, right? And here Trump showed his true colors as soon as [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=543.24s)]
*  he lost an election and we can assume that he will do it again and that's why we have to take [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=551.0s)]
*  the extraordinary measure provided for, as Joyce pointed out, provided for in the Constitution for [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=555.64s)]
*  this exact problem. I figure if a DUI can disqualify you for driving from Uber, I don't see how an [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=561.48s)]
*  insurrection can't disqualify you from running for president. Joyce Vance and Ellie Mistel, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=568.52s)]
*  thank you so much for starting us off on All In tonight. I should mention we are expecting the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=572.04s)]
*  main Secretary of State to join us on the show later in the hour. So much more to come on this [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=578.2s)]
*  story. But first, if you want the MAGA vote, you need to accept everything that comes with it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=583.48s)]
*  Why Nikki Haley conveniently forgot about slavery in America, next on All In. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  If Nikki Haley wants to be the Republican nominee for president, she is going to have to win over [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  some Trump supporters. And yesterday she demonstrated just how low she will sink to do so. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=602.12s)]
*  At a town hall event in New Hampshire, the former South Carolina governor could not even answer the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=609.32s)]
*  most basic, are you smarter than a fifth-grader history question about the cause of the Civil War. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=614.92s)]
*  What was the cause of the United States Civil War? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=622.36s)]
*  Well, don't come with an easy question or anything. I mean, I think the cause of the Civil War was [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=625.4s)]
*  basically how government was going to run. The freedoms and what people could and couldn't do. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  What do you think the cause of the Civil War was? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=640.84s)]
*  I'm sorry? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=647.64s)]
*  I mean, I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=655.56s)]
*  And we, I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=661.64s)]
*  and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn't need [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=667.8s)]
*  to tell you how to live your life. They don't need to tell you what you can and can't do. They don't [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=672.52s)]
*  need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom. We need to have [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=676.84s)]
*  capitalism. We need to have economic freedom. We need to make sure that we do all things [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=681.56s)]
*  so that individuals have the liberties so that they can have freedom of speech, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=685.8s)]
*  freedom of religion, freedom to do or be anything they want to be without government getting in the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=689.56s)]
*  way. What do you want me to say about slavery? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=694.1199999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine a kid at a Spelly Bee saying, well, how would you spell it? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=705.88s)]
*  This kind of pandering from Haley to the worst elements of her party's base is not new. There's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=708.9200000000001s)]
*  a long and storied history in South Carolina of pretending the Civil War was about states' rights. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=714.6s)]
*  In fact, there are hundreds of respected, credible historians who would make that same argument. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  When Haley first ran for governor in 2010, she was at least willing to acknowledge that there were [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=724.84s)]
*  two sides to the Civil War. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=729.8s)]
*  I think you had one side of the Civil War that was fighting for tradition, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=759.8s)]
*  and I think you had another side of the Civil War that was fighting for change. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=762.8399999999999s)]
*  See, what makes this all so cynical is that the only reason anyone even knows Nikki Haley's name [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=768.28s)]
*  outside of South Carolina is because, as governor back in 2015, she demonstrated the tiniest sliver [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=774.12s)]
*  of courage necessary to take down the Confederate flag from the state Capitol. And I want to be [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=781.4s)]
*  clear, it was only a sliver of courage, because she was only willing to move the flag after a [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=787.08s)]
*  white supremacist terrorist murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, including one of my [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=792.0400000000001s)]
*  oldest friends and her former statehouse colleague, state senator and senior pastor, Clem Pankney. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=798.6s)]
*  Nikki Haley actually referenced the shooting and her response to it in her 2024 campaign [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=805.24s)]
*  announcement video. But now, apparently Nikki Haley is so desperate for MAGA validation, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=811.4s)]
*  she's ashamed of the one time she did the bare minimum. If there was a photo negative of doing [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=817.72s)]
*  too much, it would be Nikki Haley. Yet this is bigger than Haley or even the CRT fear-mongering, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  bad-faith, moms-for-liberty-loving base that's what's left of the GOP. Roughly 40% of America [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=830.04s)]
*  is perfectly fine with presidential candidates that can't answer basic history questions, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  which makes it incumbent upon the rest of us to vote and keep their bad influence in check. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=840.68s)]
*  My guest now is Congressman James Clyburn. He's known Nikki Haley for many years. He's a Democrat [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=847.2399999999999s)]
*  of South Carolina and serves as the Assistant Democratic Leader in the House of Representatives. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=852.76s)]
*  He joins me now. Congressman, great to speak to you. I'll start with this. You've known Nikki [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=857.0799999999999s)]
*  Haley for a very, very long time. Have you ever had a conversation with her where she's mentioned [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=864.76s)]
*  the word slavery? Well, first of all, Jason, thank you very much for having me. No, I have never had [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=870.68s)]
*  a conversation with Nikki Haley about slavery. We did have a very long conversation about the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=877.8s)]
*  Confederate battle flag. And I keep calling it that because it was never the flag of the Confederacy. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=884.36s)]
*  And I think the people need to understand that this is the Confederate battle flag. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=891.32s)]
*  And it was always rejected by those people who were real Confederates. They rejected that flag [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=896.5200000000001s)]
*  in favor of the so-called stars and bars, three bars in a circle of 13 stars. So Nikki Haley [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=903.5600000000001s)]
*  accepted that. And she came forward. We spoke at Marsh Brown AME Church just after the murder of [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=911.88s)]
*  those nine souls at Emanuel, one of whom you mentioned, Clemente Pankney, who was one of my [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=923.0799999999999s)]
*  first interns. He was still a college student. And she then stepped up. And we had a conversation [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  and she told me what she was going to do. And that's what I support her. I did support her, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=938.68s)]
*  Tim Scott, and I stood with her along with others when she asked that the flag be taken down. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=945.4s)]
*  That to me was a moment that I thought she was going to build upon. Instead, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=953.16s)]
*  she seemed to have retrogressed from that point. And I think it's very, very unfortunate. It may [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=961.4799999999999s)]
*  hinder her in the Republican primary. In fact, the reason the Republican Party built this base in [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=968.04s)]
*  South Carolina was over the Confederate battle flag. But it will not hinder her. In fact, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=977.0799999999999s)]
*  I think it will hurt when you get to the general election. And I'm just very, very sorry that she [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=984.52s)]
*  took this turn. Congressman, back in 2015, you actually tweeted, as you just mentioned, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=992.76s)]
*  you tweeted support. You said, Governor Nikki Haley-Stan should be applauded and I'm hopeful [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1000.6s)]
*  that the SC legislator will codify her sentiments. You're a member of Congress. You are actually one [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1004.68s)]
*  of the most influential Democrats over the last 30 years. I mean, you get to determine a lot of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1012.04s)]
*  what actually happens in this country. So you have insights that most people don't have. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1017.16s)]
*  What do you think is the motivation behind Haley basically abandoning what was, even in your words, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1021.56s)]
*  a fairly courageous moment to—is it just about pandering? Do you think that she's read some brand [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1029.08s)]
*  new book that's given her a new perspective? What do you think would motivate someone who took a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1036.36s)]
*  difficult stand just five or six years ago to have such a disingenuous and sort of gaslighting answer [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1041.8s)]
*  to the public when she's trying to be the president for the entire United States instead [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1047.16s)]
*  of just governor of South Carolina? I think that most of the Republican candidates seem to feel [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1050.8400000000001s)]
*  that what worked for Donald Trump is going to work for them. They understood what Donald Trump was [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1057.88s)]
*  doing when he ran for president. When he came down the escalator, when he began to denigrate [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1063.8000000000002s)]
*  the Mexicans and immigrants, and he expanded that to include what he called [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1073.0s)]
*  S-hole countries. And he keeps going to that. He's now talking about what he's going to do [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1082.28s)]
*  about immigration and the only countries that he seems to want to keep people—natives he [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1089.4s)]
*  want to keep out of this country are countries of color. So I think that Nikki Haley and others [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1096.1999999999998s)]
*  have picked that up. That's what DeSantis was doing when he went down in Florida when he said [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1103.3999999999999s)]
*  he was going to bring Florida to the national stage, banning books. Those kinds of things [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  seem to be working. And so I think that that's why they are perpetuating [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1119.0s)]
*  to that mode of thinking, and I just think they're wrong about that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, today Nikki Haley says that she misspoke and apparently wants to clarify things. I guess [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1131.2399999999998s)]
*  she's hoping that people will show her a level of grace that she hasn't shown others. Congressman [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1136.84s)]
*  James Clyburn, thank you so much for joining us on All-In this evening. Thank you very much for having [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1140.6s)]
*  me. Stay tuned. The Maine Secretary of State, who just announced her decision to remove Donald [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1145.48s)]
*  Trump from the state's ballot, joins me right here on All-In. Next, you don't want to miss it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1151.96s)]
*  We want to go back to the big news that we brought you at the top of this hour. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1161.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has been kicked off another presidential ballot. This time in the state of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1165.72s)]
*  Maine, a decision that comes 10 days after the Supreme Court of Colorado ruled that Trump [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1170.3600000000001s)]
*  is disqualified from the ballot there due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1175.16s)]
*  that culminated in the insurrection of the Capitol on January 6th, though that Colorado decision is [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1180.28s)]
*  on pause pending an appeal by the state Republican Party. There are 16 states that have been [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1185.96s)]
*  considering efforts to remove Trump from their ballots, including Michigan, the Supreme Court [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1190.8400000000001s)]
*  decided yesterday that Trump can stay on the ballot and Colorado and Maine. Most of those are [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1195.24s)]
*  lawsuits working their way through the courts, but Maine's process was a little different. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1202.04s)]
*  There, the arguments were made directly to the Democratic Secretary of State, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1207.0s)]
*  Shenna Bellows. It was her decision to make. We have her here. Shenna Bellows, the Maine [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1210.2s)]
*  Secretary of State who signed off on that decision joins me now. Secretary Bellows, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1215.3999999999999s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us on All-In this evening. I'm just going to ask you up front, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1219.56s)]
*  what went into making this decision? Was it your own research? Did you have a legal team together? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1224.92s)]
*  Did you look at the Colorado decision? What was the process to come to the conclusion [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1230.52s)]
*  that Donald Trump should be disqualified from being on the Maine ballot? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1235.0s)]
*  Well, first, it's important and thank you for having me. It's important to understand [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1240.04s)]
*  how Maine's process differs from other states. Under the United States Constitution, time, place, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1243.96s)]
*  and manner, every state's laws around elections and the conduct of elections are slightly different. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1249.56s)]
*  That's why, for example, in neighboring New Hampshire, you see more than a dozen candidates [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1255.6399999999999s)]
*  in both the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries, whereas in Maine, we have a very [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1259.72s)]
*  different process. We had two Democratic candidates qualify for the presidential primary and less than [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1265.4s)]
*  a dozen candidates qualify for the Republican primary. Now, under the law, I first make a [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1271.32s)]
*  determination about ballot qualification. We accepted Trump's consent form and petitions [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1278.2s)]
*  to be placed on the primary ballot. However, any registered Maine voter may challenge the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1285.24s)]
*  qualifications of any candidate within a five-day period. And then I am required by law, it's an [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1292.52s)]
*  authority delegated to me explicitly by the Maine legislature, to hold what's called a Section 336 [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1299.4s)]
*  challenge hearing. Both parties come, they present their evidence, they file briefs. I review [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1305.8000000000002s)]
*  only that evidence in the context of the laws, the facts presented, and the Constitution, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1313.24s)]
*  and then I must make a determination. I'm duty-bound to both hold a hearing and make a ruling. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1320.36s)]
*  And under the law, there's a very compressed timeline. In evaluating this, I came to the [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1327.64s)]
*  conclusion that I could not, unfortunately or fortunately, wait for the United States [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1334.04s)]
*  Supreme Court to make a decision. The Maine law required me to issue that decision, which I did [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1340.44s)]
*  today. Now, I have to say, not only is this an incredibly important decision, but it's a very [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1348.2s)]
*  brave decision. The Trump campaign has already come out attacking you. They have said that you are a [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1356.44s)]
*  virulent leftist and a hyper-partisan Biden-supporting Democrat. It goes without saying [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1364.12s)]
*  that we all saw what happened on January 6th. We've seen a tremendous amount of violence [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1371.4799999999998s)]
*  associated with any time someone tries to hold Trump accountable. We've seen death threats against [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1375.7199999999998s)]
*  the judges in Colorado. Was that a concern of yours? And has the state provided you with [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1381.56s)]
*  additional protection and support since you've come down with this decision? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1387.9599999999998s)]
*  First and foremost, it's important to know my oath to the Constitution, my obligations to the [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1391.4s)]
*  Constitution and rule of law come before any other consideration. No other factors could weigh on [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1398.76s)]
*  that decision and did not. I'm very fortunate. We are very fortunate here in Maine. We have terrific [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1405.48s)]
*  support from law enforcement, both within my department, the Maine Capitol Police, the Maine [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1411.4s)]
*  State Police. I feel well protected, as I have been for my entire time as Secretary. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1415.88s)]
*  So I have to ask this because I think this also speaks to your credibility. Maine has some of the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1423.8000000000002s)]
*  highest turnout of any state in the union. I mean, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, you have, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1427.88s)]
*  you know, Maine, even though as a state tends to vote for Democrats for president, you have one [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1433.88s)]
*  independent senator and one Republican. How do you do it? How do you get such high turnout in the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1439.0800000000002s)]
*  state amongst all sort of political partisans? I smile because we were number one in voter [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1444.04s)]
*  turnout per capita in 2022. We are really proud of that. And we have a really strong framework [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1450.36s)]
*  of election laws that encourage citizen participation. We have same day voter [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1457.24s)]
*  registration. We have no excuse absentee voting up to 30 days prior to election day. We make it [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1462.76s)]
*  really easy to register to vote, to cast your ballot and know your ballot will be counted. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1471.64s)]
*  And we are really proud of our national leadership in voter participation and citizen engagement in [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1476.44s)]
*  elections and in the democratic process. And that is why we take so seriously our obligations to the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1483.3200000000002s)]
*  Constitution and the rule of law. Secretary Bellows, there are people all over the country, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1489.72s)]
*  independent groups, other secretaries of state, you know, judges, legislators, lawyers who are [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1496.68s)]
*  watching you right now. Are you expecting to or have you prior to this decision? Has anyone reached [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1502.36s)]
*  out to you? Have other secretaries of state reached out to you and said, hey, how did you, you know, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1509.96s)]
*  I'm struggling with this. Could you help me as well? Or is this a decision that you're saying, hey, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1513.8799999999999s)]
*  everything that I think is in this written decision and I'm not really open to providing, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1519.32s)]
*  you know, counsel or assistance to any other states that may be struggling with this issue? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1524.68s)]
*  That's really important. The latter is the case. This decision is based on main law and the facts [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1529.64s)]
*  that were presented to me in the Section 336 challenge. It was really important to me to look [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1535.3200000000002s)]
*  at the evidence presented in the public hearing and the law and the facts presented in the context [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1541.72s)]
*  of main law Sections 336, 337 and 443. It's a very detailed decision. We lay out why under main law [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1548.04s)]
*  the secretary of state has the authority, indeed the obligation, I'm duty bound to make this [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1557.32s)]
*  determination. We also, I rather laid out that the record demonstrates that in fact the events of [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1562.6s)]
*  January 6, 2021, which were unprecedented and tragic, were an insurrection in the meaning of [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1570.2s)]
*  Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. And finally, in reviewing the facts presented, the evidence, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1576.44s)]
*  the law, the history, we determined under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment that Mr. Trump [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1584.2s)]
*  engaged in insurrection and therefore was disqualified. So one of the things that you [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1593.4s)]
*  mentioned is that since anyone within a certain period of time can challenge a candidate's [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1598.68s)]
*  eligibility, you have people present the case that Trump should be off the ballot and obviously [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1603.56s)]
*  you have people present the case that Trump should remain on the ballot, right? You had people from [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1607.48s)]
*  both sides making this argument. So here's my question. I wonder if this sort of came up because [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1612.44s)]
*  it's always something I've questioned about sort of the Trump argument. Donald Trump claims that [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1617.3999999999999s)]
*  he was elected in 2020 and that the election was stolen from him. My understanding of the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1624.36s)]
*  Constitution is if you've already been elected twice, you're not allowed to serve again. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1631.16s)]
*  How did you deal with some of the arguments that you heard from the Trump side and do they have [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1635.24s)]
*  an opportunity to appeal if they're unhappy with your decision? Certainly. Mr. Trump was represented [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1641.5600000000002s)]
*  by counsel. This was an administrative hearing. I was serving not as an advocate but an adjudicator [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1648.3600000000001s)]
*  as an administrative hearing officer in the hearing. And Paul Gordon was one of the three [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1653.24s)]
*  challengers who brought a challenge and he brought it under the 22nd Amendment alleging that because [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1660.6s)]
*  Mr. Trump has said publicly that he won in 2020 that he was disqualified from appearing on the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1665.88s)]
*  ballot under the 22nd Amendment. My decision also found that the facts did not, were not in dispute. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1671.72s)]
*  No party suggested that Mr. Trump had in fact won in 2020 and the 22nd Amendment did not apply [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1681.16s)]
*  in this case. There were other challenges brought by Marion Royal and by a group of former senators, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1688.04s)]
*  Republican state senator, former Republican state senator Kimberly Rosen, former Republican [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1694.92s)]
*  state senator Thomas Saviello, former Democratic state senator Ethan Striemling, and those challenges [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1699.72s)]
*  were brought under section three of the 14th Amendment. And that is where my ruling did in [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1705.24s)]
*  fact find that Mr. Trump was not qualified for ballot access in Maine. Maine Secretary of State [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1710.0400000000002s)]
*  Shenna Bellows, thank you so much for the serious work. I hope you stay safe and I hope you stay [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1718.8400000000001s)]

*  In 2010, they were the boy band generation of Republicans who were going to change the party. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1752.6s)]
*  You know, Paul Ryan of the P90X flexing, you know, he was the cute one and Kevin McCarthy was the [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  tax-loving sensitive one and Eric Cantor was the bad boy. They rounded out a group that would fuse [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1764.6s)]
*  tea party politics with wonky policies and well, you know how that worked out. Ryan and McCarthy [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1770.36s)]
*  ultimately lost their leadership roles. Cantor couldn't even win a reelection primary. Now, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1776.44s)]
*  instead of boy bands, House Republicans are a bunch of proud boys. Gun-loving MAGA extremists [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1781.8799999999999s)]

*  Party? Well, it would be saying that we are not capable of representing the districts where we [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1849.3200000000002s)]
*  have started out and now we want to switch and we go look for something else. Maybe we would get [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1857.4s)]

*  goes to a new district that is more conservative, I think those conservative members of those [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1891.24s)]
*  districts will understand that this is not someone that they want to serve as a representative for [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1897.08s)]
*  them because of what she is transporting to their children. You know, it's interesting. She's trying [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1903.3999999999999s)]
*  to go into Ken Buck's former district. Yes. And Ken Buck was one of the Republicans saying, hey, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1909.72s)]
*  we're not getting anything done. He was tired of people like Lauren Boebert. As someone who's worked [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1914.1999999999998s)]

*  anything done? I mean, this is the least productive House of Representatives session since 1989. Only [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1929.4799999999998s)]
*  20 bills passed and signed into law. What's that like for you who's so used to actually getting [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1937.4799999999998s)]
*  things done in Congress? Well, actually, it's pathetic on the Republican side. They can't govern. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1941.3999999999999s)]
*  They're in disarray. It is chaotic. It is pitiful. Out of, you know, 700 votes or so, they got, what, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1947.0s)]
*  27 votes all year and only 26 of them were passed. And so they're incapable of directing and running [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1954.12s)]
*  this government. And so they're in deep trouble. And if they think somehow that is not going to [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1963.3999999999999s)]
*  be understood by the American public and they're going to win because they're all hiding behind [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1968.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, it's not going to happen. We're going to take back the House for sure. I have to ask you [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1974.52s)]
*  this because one of the things that you often hear political analysts, pundits, journalists talk [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1980.68s)]
*  about is where is the enthusiasm going to be for the Democratic Party? You are probably one of the [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1986.2s)]
*  most well-known members of Congress on either side of the party. You are meaned. You are known by [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1992.28s)]
*  older voters and younger voters and everything else like that. What do you think your role will be [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=1998.6000000000001s)]
*  in 2024 when it comes to speaking to those people who are disenchanted, speaking to those people who [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2002.92s)]
*  say it's a pox on both houses, the Democrats can't get anything in the public. What are you going [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2007.8s)]
*  to say to those people next year to make sure that they turn out and vote so that the House can get [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2011.8799999999999s)]
*  back in the hands of Democrats? One of the things I think we need to do is remind people of what we [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2015.56s)]
*  have done and what Democrats have accomplished and what Biden has done. We did a remarkable job [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2019.72s)]
*  doing covert, making sure that people had food on the table. Don't forget the PPP loan that we created [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2026.04s)]

*  at it. And he's done a good job. He really has been a strong Democrat who has delivered and he's [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2049.7200000000003s)]

*  I tend to be skeptical when I see all these numbers that say, oh, black folks are voting for Trump. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2062.6800000000003s)]

*  I don't know a lot of anybody who says that they're voting for Trump. When you hear those [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2071.7200000000003s)]
*  kinds of things, when you hear it said by serious journalists and everything else like that, that [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2075.6400000000003s)]
*  black people, in particular black men, are moving to the Republican Party, is that what you're seeing [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2080.04s)]
*  on the ground? Is that what you see in LA? No, I hear a little bit of that. But sometimes I think [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2084.28s)]
*  that's done to create controversy. And I think that people want to see if young people are going [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2089.0s)]
*  to start to talk like they're talking about supporting Trump. It's not going to happen. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2095.64s)]

*  Young people are going to be happy to elect someone that they said wants to, he said he wants to be a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2128.36s)]
*  dictator. I don't think so. When it gets down to it, black people are going to turn out in large [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2133.5600000000004s)]
*  numbers. Young people are going to turn out in large numbers. And I want to tell you that [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2139.24s)]

*  country or our democracy. Always love talking to the congressman, Maxine Waters. Thank you so much [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2156.68s)]
*  for joining us this evening on All In. You're welcome. Still to come as the Republican front [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2162.8399999999997s)]
*  runner complains of rising crime rates, the true story about law and order in America. Next on All [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2168.52s)]
*  In. We are just days away from the start of a presidential election year where the front [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2174.12s)]
*  runner for the Republican nomination talks a great deal about crime and the need for law and order. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2187.48s)]
*  Going so far as to call for police to shoot shoplifters. We are also over three years from [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2192.7599999999998s)]
*  the killing of George Floyd. It sparked widespread calls for police reform. So if we go beyond the [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2198.6s)]
*  political rhetoric, what's the real state of crime and policing in America at this point? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2204.92s)]
*  The number of homicides is set for a record drop this year, which is in sharp contrast with [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2210.6s)]
*  Americans' perception that crime is going up. But while there are fewer homicides happening, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2216.68s)]
*  we are also seeing fewer of them actually being solved. According to a Vox report on [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2222.44s)]
*  federal crime data with one analyst finding that the police rate for clearing murder cases [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2227.56s)]
*  has fallen from 60% in 2019 to 52% in 2022. This is important because protecting people from getting [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2233.3199999999997s)]
*  killed and solving murders when they happen is probably the highest order of responsibility [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2241.0s)]
*  for a police officer. What does this tell us about the state of policing in America? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2245.72s)]
*  To discuss, bringing in our guest, Philip Atiba Solomon is co-founder and CEO of the Center for [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2250.6s)]
*  Policing Equity. He also chairs the African American Studies Department at Yale University. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2256.52s)]
*  He joins me now. Great to talk to you. I've also had you on my podcast, A Word. So it's great to [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2260.68s)]
*  see you in person after we've already podcasted together. Philip, I want to start with this. This [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2266.2799999999997s)]
*  is a fascinating sort of quote from this Vox research. We can relate the drop in clearance [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2272.12s)]
*  rates to everything that's happened in American criminal justice and policing and attitudes [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2279.3199999999997s)]
*  towards police since the murder of George Floyd. What does that mean? That sounds like a bunch of [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2284.2799999999997s)]
*  words, Sal, because my understanding here is that police, again, their primary job should be clearing [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2290.68s)]
*  cases, clearing red balls. Why is that not working? Yeah, so when people think about [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2297.8s)]
*  their investment in supporting law enforcement, I think almost all of them would be shocked to hear [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2305.8s)]
*  that if you murder someone in this country, it's a coin flip about whether or not you're going to [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2311.48s)]
*  get caught. What the article is supposed to be saying, the quote is supposed to be going after, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2314.92s)]
*  is the idea that all of the protest against law enforcement and the way that we do it in this [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2321.7200000000003s)]
*  country is the reason why we're solving fewer cases. But that's, as you say, gobbledygook. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2326.6s)]
*  The reality is that there are absolutely communities that don't trust their law enforcement, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2332.6s)]
*  and as a result, they won't call in when they have information about a crime because they're [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2337.56s)]
*  worried about what's going to happen to them, and they don't think that law enforcement has a [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2341.96s)]
*  reasonable job to do in their communities. So lack of trust in communities is absolutely one thing, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2345.7999999999997s)]
*  but the protests, you can't make the argument the protests were the reason why law enforcement [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2350.12s)]
*  wasn't doing a good job on it because the clearance rate was only 60% before the lynching [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2354.52s)]
*  of George Floyd. So it's a more systemic issue than just everything that happened since 2020. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2358.92s)]
*  And Philip, I think this is really important. If only before George Floyd, maybe 60% [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2365.96s)]
*  of homicides were actually solved by police, when it comes to public service employees, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2373.0s)]
*  if you had a high school where the teachers were only graduating 60% of the students, that high [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2378.2s)]
*  school would be considered a failure, right? The state would come in and say, hey, hey, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2383.24s)]
*  we got to fire everybody. We need to do something new. And yet what we've seen when it comes to [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2386.8399999999997s)]
*  American policing is even as the number one crime homicide is being handled and cleared at a lower [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2390.7599999999998s)]
*  rate, police salaries and investment in policing has gone up. Why do you think we seem to believe [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2397.0s)]
*  in our cities and in our federal government that throwing money at this problem is going to improve [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2404.2s)]
*  it when the numbers seem to show otherwise? So Jason, you've only created a contradiction [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2408.84s)]
*  if we've agreed that solving murders is the number one thing that police should do. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2414.04s)]
*  And that's a reasonable thing to ask police to do. It's a reasonable thing for folks to decide, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2418.44s)]
*  that's my number one. But as a society, we absolutely haven't done that, right? Because [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2422.36s)]
*  we get lots of places where the number one type of call they get is responding to teenagers [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2427.48s)]
*  engaging in vandalism, lots of places where it's mental health, where it's substance abuse, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2432.6800000000003s)]
*  where it's homelessness. If you ask one group of people to solve homicides, to go into active [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2437.24s)]
*  shooter situations, to deal with homelessness, to deal with school issues, to deal with substance [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2443.9599999999996s)]
*  abuse, to deal with family crises, also to deal with loud parties, all of that goes under one roof. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2449.08s)]
*  It's very difficult to decide, well, what was the most important thing for them to be doing? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2454.52s)]
*  But the central piece of it to me is this. After 2020, we had some agreement [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2459.16s)]
*  that the way we were trying to keep communities safe wasn't working, that we were asking police [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2466.52s)]
*  at least to do too much, and that what they were doing in the spaces where they couldn't possibly [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2471.24s)]
*  be qualified to do everything, we should get something else. We failed to do anything like [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2475.88s)]
*  that, like that agreement that we all had. By the way, there were a lot of Republicans calling and [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2481.96s)]
*  saying, hey, we're on board with this after 2020. We failed to do anything on that federally. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2485.88s)]
*  We're doing some things like that on the state level, Washington state, Connecticut, looking to [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2491.56s)]
*  get police out of the low level traffic enforcement business. And we're doing a lot of it at the local [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2496.76s)]
*  level. We're just not telling the stories like in St. Louis, like in Culver City, where they're [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2501.56s)]
*  getting co-response models, where they're standing up new infrastructures that put communities in [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2507.56s)]
*  charge of public safety. And because we're not telling those stories, it feels like we're not [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2511.8s)]
*  doing anything at all. That's not the truth. And heading into 2024, we're going to need to find [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2516.12s)]
*  those stories and tell them. Otherwise, we're going to be contrasting savings at Walgreens [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2520.04s)]
*  from this guy who's got 91 criminal indictments against him. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2526.6s)]
*  AARON MATEFIELD MOYERS Philip and Teeba Solomon, thank you so much for joining us [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qga3SWmsAUE&t=2529.16s)]
