# ‘At the defendant’s direction’ Jack Smith previews plan for prosecuting Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We've got a big development today in a case that's fallen off the radar over the past few months [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  special counsel Jack Smith's federal election interference case against Donald Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=6.4s)]
*  Even as the ex-president tries to wriggle and bully his way out of accountability for his various misdeeds [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=11.16s)]
*  To lash out at the judge and their prosecutors the special counsel's office is looking to bring some justice and hold Trump accountable for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=16.56s)]
*  Attempting to overthrow the 2020 election by making the insurrection the key focus of their federal criminal case against him [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=24.32s)]
*  Politically, I think and I don't think I'm saying anything profound here. That's not great for Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean remember January 6 was both the lowest point of his presidency in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=38.0s)]
*  Substantively in moral terms and also politically in terms of political popular opinion [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=44.0s)]
*  And it looks like voters will be reminded of that dark moment in American history in the lead-up to next year's election [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=49.04s)]
*  Because right now it is not exactly front of mind for voters [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=55.72s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump is general is not exactly front of mind for voters his strategy whether intentional or not [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=59.0s)]
*  I think he sort of backed into it since he left office [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=64.88s)]
*  Has been to kind of silo himself off in a MAGA bubble [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=67.92s)]
*  The people around Donald Trump understand that he is unpopular that the more voters see of him the less they like him [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=73.42s)]
*  He's no longer on Twitter or X or whatever the heck. It's called these days instead [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=80.42s)]
*  He just preaches to the choir on his own social media platform. He is increasingly unhinged rallies and not just unhinged [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=84.26s)]
*  He doesn't seem he seems confused. He warned about us starting World War two [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=92.22s)]
*  Those are really only carried live by the most die-hard MAGA network [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=97.06s)]
*  So a lot of people aren't seeing those he skipped last night's Republican primary debate like he skipped the two that came before it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=101.08s)]
*  So people aren't seeing him there [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=107.28s)]
*  Of course in that time Trump's only increased his lead over the Republican primary field without ever showing up. So why would he show up? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  Republican primary voters want Trump and they are keyed in to his closed-off media ecosystem. I [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=116.92s)]
*  Don't think the same can be said for the average American voter though [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=123.4s)]
*  The news cycle has crowded Trump out a bit particularly in the wake of the war in the Middle East [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=127.0s)]
*  But in the background day by day [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=132.0s)]
*  We are heading towards what will be one of the most [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  Consequential trials in American history and the biggest political event in memory the sustained criminal litigation of Donald Trump's role in the attempted coup [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=137.36s)]
*  To that end today [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=146.76s)]
*  We have new reporting that gives us an idea of how Donald Trump might face justice for the most egregious of his crimes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=147.96s)]
*  According to a new court filing Smith's prosecutors are looking to make the case that Trump's various criminal conspiracies to overturn the 2020 election [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=155.38s)]
*  Quote culminated and converged when on January 6th the defendant attempted to obstruct and prevent the congressional certification at the Capitol [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=162.94s)]
*  As my next guest reports Smith's office is effectively casting quote [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=171.58s)]
*  Effectively quote casting Trump is one of the 1200 plus riot defendants who have already been charged [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  In other words when Donald Trump goes to trial next year [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=181.18s)]
*  He will be treated the same as the hundreds and hundreds of violent rioters who storm the Capitol [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=183.94000000000003s)]
*  Assaulted police officers and tried to overthrow the results of a free and fair election [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=188.74s)]
*  According to the filing Smith's team seeks to highlight the actions of those rioters the jury through quote testimony video [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=193.5s)]
*  photographic and geolocation evidence [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  Establishing that many of Trump supporters responded to his direction on January 6th [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=203.02s)]
*  That's right testimony so Smith's team is apparently planning on having some January 6 insurrectionist [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=207.74s)]
*  Testify against Trump at trial to make the case that yes, it was that that guy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=213.9s)]
*  Obviously the ex-president the the one whose name was like emblazoned on our hats and on all our signs and all our gear [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=220.26s)]
*  And who told us to go to the Capitol remember that guy the guy who's there sitting at the defendants table in the trial [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=227.18s)]
*  That guy is the one responsible for the riot [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=232.9s)]
*  That's the guy that convinced me us to storm the Capitol through his words and actions [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=235.38s)]
*  So next year when Donald Trump goes to trial just one day one day before Super Tuesday primary [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=241.94s)]
*  If Jack Smith gets his way jurors by extension voters will not only be reminded [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  In the lengths Donald Trump will go to in order to end American democracy [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=252.74s)]
*  They will be told that he is no different from the hundreds of people already found guilty for their role in his attempted coup [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=256.22s)]
*  Kyle Cheney is the senior legal affairs reporter for Politico who report on Jack Smith's court filing and he joins me now [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=264.14s)]
*  Kyle first just give us this this is all working off of a filing from the prosecutor special prosecutor's office [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  What is the filing? Why did it have to be filed and what does it say? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  Sure, so to everything you just said Donald Trump has basically argued [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  Jacksmith his team they shouldn't even mention the riot at this trial in their filings [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=285.62s)]
*  It's in the indictment kind of glancingly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=290.1s)]
*  They said we should strike that out of the indictment because I'm not charged with anything to do with the violence that occurred at [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=292.26s)]
*  the Capitol and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=297.5s)]
*  You know there was a reasonable argument that maybe Jack Smith wasn't going to feature that at the trial [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=298.78s)]
*  But but you know Jack Smith he gave that famous opening statement where he referenced the violence and then we weren't sure what's gonna happen with [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=303.28s)]
*  That in the course of these proceedings. Well, Jack Smith did tip his hand [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=309.3s)]
*  He said not only are we gonna mention the trial the the violence at trial [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=312.74s)]
*  We're gonna focus on we're gonna make it a feature of this trial where we're gonna show how what occurred there the the danger the threat [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=316.06s)]
*  To democracy the violence the attacks on police were inspired by stoked by [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=321.5s)]
*  And sort of allowed to occur by by Donald Trump himself [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=326.22s)]
*  So it's filings back and forth about what can and cannot be addressed in court, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=330.26s)]
*  And and I want to read from your your piece here that the description the case [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  He plans to lay out was a response to Trump's demand that US District Court judge Tanya Chuchkin strike [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  References to the January 6 riot from the language of the indictment [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=344.04s)]
*  Arguing the charges against him aren't related to the riot the reference the attack were inflammatory [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=347.76s)]
*  surplusage intended to stir the passions of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=352.32s)]
*  Perspective jurors. So this is the first time where we've we have a deferred of argument publicly made in a court filing by Smith's office [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=355.48s)]
*  It says yes what happened on that day the violence of that day the people that were there on that day [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=362.12s)]
*  Those are intimate parts of the case. We're going to bring against the defendant [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  Right, this is not just some sort of ancillary part of the story. This is the story [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=371.56s)]
*  This is this is Donald Trump used the not only did he sort of stoke the riot and inflame it further by attacking Mike Pence [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  While the violence was going on he used it to try to continue to obstruct the January 6th session of Congress [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=381.56s)]
*  He knew what was going on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=387.24s)]
*  He didn't intervene and then he actually tried you know used that time to try to call their senators call members of Congress to continue [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=388.32s)]
*  To try to delay the certification of Biden's victory and one of the things you know [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  There's a debate when we when we were getting reporting about Jack Smith working on this indictment whether he would be charged with incitement or [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=398.8s)]
*  Insurrection or one of those right he ultimately wasn't either of those but the conspiracy to obstruct official proceeding which [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=406.2s)]
*  Hundreds of I'm not folks have actually either pleaded to or been convicted of that's where they're making the legal case that like you can't [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=413.48s)]
*  Separate that crime from what happened on that day [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=419.76s)]
*  Right exactly that I mean Donald Trump is charged with 1512 C. That's the statute code [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=423.16s)]
*  obstruction of an official proceeding as you mentioned hundreds of January 6 rioters charged with the same crime and what Jack Smith says in this filing is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=429.12s)]
*  Essentially their charge for basically the same reason and everything that had everything about the riot is central to that charge whether it's against [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=435.54s)]
*  Donald Trump or against a guy who tried to break through the police lines that day [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  It was sort of with the same goal in mind and though they're not co-conspirators linked in the crime together [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  They essentially were operating in parallel [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  Now this filing comes as they're sort of an interesting thing developing where judge Chuckin has kept things on schedule for that March trial date [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=453.88s)]
*  She's given some latitude to trump and filings for other motions around different things [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=461.76s)]
*  There's been contestation of a protective order. There's been some other sort of briefing that's happening [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=466.64s)]
*  But that stuff as I understand it now is parallel to it as a trial schedule that essentially remains [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=471.64s)]
*  Locked in for now at least yes [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, judge Chuckin has made one thing clear is that that March 4th trial date that is not moving [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=481.86s)]
*  I would they would take something extraordinary for her to move that she has said it will not yield to the election calendar [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=486.3s)]
*  Which you know to just Trump's frustration and his lawyers frustration [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=491.34s)]
*  They keep saying, you know, we should just push everything back a little bit [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=494.54s)]
*  Just give us more time and she's saying, you know [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=497.5s)]
*  I'll give you a little time within the window between now and March 4th, but not gonna move that ultimate date [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=499.26s)]
*  All right, Kyle Cheney with that reporting on the briefing that came from the special prosecutor's office for politico [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=505.26s)]
*  Thanks a lot. Appreciate it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlY-aoSYEHQ&t=510.9s)]
