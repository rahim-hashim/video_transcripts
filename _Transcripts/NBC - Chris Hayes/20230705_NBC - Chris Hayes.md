Video Description: Chris Hayes on the rise of the global temperature: "It's like going from a normal, 98.6 degree body temperature to spiking a 101.3 degree fever. At 101.3 degrees, you are pretty sick—and that metaphor is almost literal because the human body really struggles in high heat."

# World records its hottest days ever this week
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I)
*  31 million Americans are sweating it out with heat alerts impacting parts of the south [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=0.0s)]
*  and the west. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=6.16s)]
*  Authorities say a 57-year-old woman died during an eight-mile hike in the Grand Canyon, with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=7.76s)]
*  temps topping 100 degrees. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=12.76s)]
*  Cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix expected to again top triple digits today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=15.8s)]
*  The extreme temperatures fueling fast-moving flames in Washington state, with fears that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=21.04s)]
*  risk of wildfire may increase during July 4th celebrations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=26.72s)]
*  Well, as it turned out yesterday, July 4th ended up being the world's hottest day on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=30.48s)]
*  record. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=37.2s)]
*  Let me say that again. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=38.2s)]
*  The hottest day ever recorded since we began keeping track. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  As environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben put it, no human has ever seen it [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=43.84s)]
*  hotter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=48.28s)]
*  Quote, the best estimate of client scientists is that it was the hottest day since sometime [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=49.28s)]
*  in the last interglacial period, 125,000 years ago, right about the time that other scientists [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=53.56s)]
*  think humans etched the first symbols onto bone and started wearing shells as decorations. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=60.28s)]
*  And it broke the previous record set on, well, July 3rd, the day before. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=65.92s)]
*  For more than four decades, we've been taking this global temperature, an average from all [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  sorts of data points around the world. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=75.56s)]
*  You can think of it like a thermometer for the planet, and it's telling us that we are [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=77.7s)]
*  spiking a very serious fever. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=81.2s)]
*  We've started to breach the threshold, surpassing the target for global warming set by experts [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=83.8s)]
*  and policymakers decades ago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=88.44s)]
*  You may have heard this number. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=90.72s)]
*  It's the amount of warning that we are trying not to exceed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=91.84s)]
*  It's 1.5 degrees Celsius above what's called pre-industrial levels. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=95.36s)]
*  That is, before we started burning fossil fuels and pushing tons of carbon into the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=99.58s)]
*  atmosphere. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=104.04s)]
*  Now, the thing about that number is it doesn't sound like much, 1.5 degrees. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=105.04s)]
*  It's about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, which is closer to understanding what it really means. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=109.26s)]
*  But if you think about it again like a thermometer, it's like going from a normal 98.6 degree [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=114.44s)]
*  body temperature to spiking a 101.3 degree fever. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=120.28s)]
*  A 101.3 degrees, you're pretty sick. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=125.9s)]
*  You're definitely feeling it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=129.44s)]
*  You're not going to die. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=130.94s)]
*  But if you spike a couple more degrees, you're going to probably end up in the hospital. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=132.46s)]
*  And that metaphor is almost literal because the human body really struggles in high heat, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=138.7s)]
*  particularly when combined with humidity. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=143.22s)]
*  A recent heat wave in Texas resulted in hundreds of hospitalizations, at least 13 deaths, 11 [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=144.94s)]
*  of them coming in just one county. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  Two others died while hiking at Big Bend National Park in West Texas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  As temperatures continue to rise, experts are acknowledging that we are more likely [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=157.98s)]
*  than not to exceed that 1.5 degree target. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=161.78s)]
*  In fact, it's all but assured at this point. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=164.7s)]
*  The only way to make sure we don't end up producing a kind of global hospitalization [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=167.6s)]
*  or a kind of civilizational heat death is to continue to rapidly expand investment in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  and deployment of carbon-free energy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=179.28s)]
*  And then we got to start figuring out how to take carbon out of the atmosphere at scale. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=182.2s)]
*  But even if we do that, it's going to get hot and hotter. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=187.84s)]
*  We are now finding out what it is like to live with a level of heat unlike anything [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=191.4s)]
*  humans have experienced for thousands of years. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=197.16s)]
*  And spoiler alert, it's not great. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QaBPk_M-I&t=200.76s)]
