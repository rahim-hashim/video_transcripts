Video Description: “No one needs to wonder anymore whether this right-wing court will—audaciously, flagrantly, in front of the whole nation—use their power to run the clock out so that Donald Trump faces no legal accountability,” says Chris Hayes on the Supreme Court taking up the Trump immunity case, further delaying his Jan. 6 trial.

# ‘The fix is in’: Coup trial delay reveals Supreme Court ‘in cahoots’ with Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today, the right-wing dominated Supreme Court gave Donald Trump a gift. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=0.0s)]
*  The biggest possible gift anyone could give him. The biggest possible gift they have given him yet. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=7.0s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump, of course, participated in a violent coup to overthrow democracy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=13.0s)]
*  The first president to set himself squarely against the constitutional order in history. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=18.0s)]
*  He rallied his supporters to storm the Capitol and steal an election he lost. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=23.0s)]
*  And he was indicted by our Justice Department, representative of us, the people, on four federal felony counts by a grand jury for his role in that insurrection. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, today, in a single-page order released at 5 o'clock, the court agreed to consider Trump's manifestly weak claim that he is immune from prosecution for the January 6th insurrection because he was acting in some senses in his official capacity as president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=38.0s)]
*  But the order itself is not the story here. It's the timing. It all comes back to the timing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=55.0s)]
*  Let's remember, the court case, the trial of Donald Trump over his effort to subvert the Constitutional Republic, was originally set to begin days from now in March. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=62.0s)]
*  All that is on hold because the Supreme Court wants to hear oral arguments for Trump's immunity claims. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=73.0s)]
*  Ready for this? Seven weeks from now, April 22nd, 2024, making it a real possibility, a likelihood, in fact, that Donald Trump will not face a trial for the crime of attempting to overthrow the American Republic, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=80.0s)]
*  will not face a jury of his peers until after the next election in which he is the likely Republican candidate. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=100.0s)]
*  I want to be crystal clear here about the importance and significance of today's news because I think a lot of reporting has missed this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=109.0s)]
*  What happened today? This one-page order looks anodyne, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=117.0s)]
*  It is an unmistakable sign from the MAGA majority of the Trump-created court that they are with him, that they are going to use their power to make sure he does not face trial in an election year for attempting to end American democracy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=125.0s)]
*  Until today, it could have gone either way. It was genuinely unclear whether they were going to give him what he wanted, whether they were going to put their shoulder to the wheel on Donald Trump's behalf. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=143.0s)]
*  Everyone has always understood the substance of his legal claim here is meritless. It lost to the district court level. It lost unanimously in the appellate court. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=155.0s)]
*  Three judges, one of whom is a Republican appointee. It is bad law under the Supreme Court's own precedent in jurisprudence. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=165.0s)]
*  The point was never to win on the merits. The point was to make a time-consuming Hail Mary Pass to attempt to escape accountability. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=173.0s)]
*  Trump's bet was that the 6-3 MAGA majority he himself created on that court would bail him out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=183.0s)]
*  That they would rob the People's Department of Justice the opportunity to present all the evidence of his guilt. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=191.0s)]
*  That the voters of this country, you and I, the hundreds of millions of us, might be robbed of the information we need to determine whether the man is guilty of the gravest crime any politician has been accused of since the Civil War. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=198.0s)]
*  Today, the court signaled they are in cahoots. That the plot is on. It's a go. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=213.0s)]
*  Yes, they will take up the case when they get to it. They have scheduled it seven weeks now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=222.0s)]
*  But keep in mind how this works. Trump's legal team encouraging and anticipating precisely this kind of delay tactic. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=230.0s)]
*  Let's go back. On December 1st, 89 days ago, federal Judge Tonya Chutkin ruled on Trump's bogus immunity claim, finding it correctly meritless. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=236.0s)]
*  Days later, on December 11th, Special Prosecutor Jack Smith, anticipating that this claim was no more than an attempt to delay and would fail on the merits, did something unusual. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=245.0s)]
*  He did something audacious. He went straight to the Supreme Court, skipping an intermediate appellate level, and he said, look, let's be clear here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=257.0s)]
*  You know and I know what's going on here. Trump's trying to delay. This is likely to land in your lap. If you're inclined to take it, let's do it now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=264.0s)]
*  Let's get to the merits of the public interest in this case. Coming to trial can be preserved. And the court said no. Just before Christmas. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=271.0s)]
*  No. Now people said at the time, well, maybe that makes sense because maybe Supreme Court justices want to let the lower appellate court, their colleagues in the D.C. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=278.0s)]
*  Circuit weigh in and not even take up the case because it's so clear cut. And then what happened? The appellate court did take up the case. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=286.0s)]
*  They heard all our arguments. They got briefed. They took a while. The clock was ticking the whole time as we sat on the show and over and over and over. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=293.0s)]
*  And then on February 6th, they came out with a unanimous decision against Trump. He is citizen Trump. He is not above the law. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=300.0s)]
*  The decision seemed carefully tailored to give the Supreme Court an easy choice to simply refuse to take up the case, to let the lower court ruling stand. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=307.0s)]
*  But if the Supreme Court wanted to take up the case and wanted to do it in expedited fashion, and let's be clear when I say the Supreme Court, the conservative majority of the court is what we're talking about here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=315.0s)]
*  They could have done it the day after they got the petition this month. That day. What did they do? No, they burned two and a half weeks for no reason. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=325.0s)]
*  They weren't producing any paper. They weren't writing any dissents or arguments. It's one page. There it is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=334.0s)]
*  They sat around for two weeks and then they issued this one page order today saying they were going to take this up. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=342.0s)]
*  They were going to schedule arguments for seven weeks from now. That is considerably longer than the expedited review of the 14th Amendment case against Trump in Colorado. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=349.0s)]
*  The one where he's challenging his right to be on the ballot, right? Now in that case, where what loomed over everyone was Donald Trump not being on the ballot, the Supreme Court wanted to expedite quickly. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=359.0s)]
*  Right? They wanted to get that one done. That ruling is going to come out before Colorado's primary next Tuesday. They move quickly there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=371.0s)]
*  But here, what the MAGA majority is telling us with this audacious order today is that the fix is in. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=380.0s)]
*  In some ways, for what it represents about the court, I think it's a hundred times worse than Bush v. Gore. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=390.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter really what they rule in the merits. They all know that. We all know that. Everyone knows the score here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=395.0s)]
*  No one should be under any illusions that any player in this drama is confused about what is happening and has happened. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=401.0s)]
*  Delay is all that matters. The pacing is all that matters. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=408.0s)]
*  No one needs to wonder anymore whether this right wing court will audaciously, flagrantly, in front of the whole nation, use their power to run the clock out. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=413.0s)]
*  So that Donald Trump faces no legal accountability, so that his guilt or innocence cannot be definitively proven to us, the voters, who I believe have a right to know whether the man is guilty or innocent. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=422.0s)]
*  So that he can return to power without us having that knowledge and dismiss these cases from his position as, and I quote him here, I quote him here, dictator on day one. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=435.0s)]
*  If you were hoping that Donald Trump's authoritarian disregard for the rule of law was going to be stopped by American institutions and the court at the highest level, that hope is severely diminished today. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=445.0s)]
*  The Mueller investigation didn't stop him. Two congressional impeachments did not stop him. Four criminal prosecutions are not going to stop him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=459.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court, he helped to stack, will not stop him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=468.0s)]
*  Today is the starkest proof yet that in the zero sum battle between MAGA and democracy, there was and is only one thing that could ever truly stop Donald Trump, and that is we the people. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=473.0s)]
*  Americans voting against him, a majority, voting against what he stands for and what he wants to do. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puqLYlrpbxw&t=486.0s)]
