# ‘Absolute madness’ Hayes rips ‘war hawks’ pushing for escalation with Iran
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE)
*  In Lebanon, the United Nations says the Israeli military opened fire on a group of peacekeepers, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=0.0s)]
*  wounding two of them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=5.8s)]
*  And nearly two dozen people were killed and more than 100 more injured after Israeli forces [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=7.32s)]
*  leveled an apartment building in central Beirut. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=12.4s)]
*  Israel is retaliating against Iran-backed Hezbollah militants who have been firing rockets [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=16.32s)]
*  into northern Israel for a year, displacing tens of thousands of Israelis. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=21.0s)]
*  There's a real concern things are going to further spiral into a wider regional conflict. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=24.92s)]
*  The world now is waiting to see if and when Israel will further escalate this conflict [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  with Iran itself, perhaps direct airstrikes on Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Now, for a very long time, an influential group of foreign policy hawks have been calling [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=38.96s)]
*  for a full-blown military conflict, a war with Iran. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  It is very clear that those people now see this moment as the best opportunity for that to happen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=47.08s)]
*  There needs to be a confrontation of Iran. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=53.36s)]
*  We've put it off way too long. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=58.56s)]
*  We need to call the question on Iran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=60.04s)]
*  They're the source of most upheaval in the region. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=62.36s)]
*  Regime change? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=64.28s)]
*  I am a thousand percent for regime change, but you don't have to put it into words. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=65.28s)]
*  How did that work out last time America tried it, in Iraq? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=68.16s)]
*  I think we have nothing to lose. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=70.44s)]
*  How did it work out when we got rid of Hitler? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=72.12s)]
*  Better. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=74.4s)]
*  He's Hitler. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=75.4s)]
*  He's Hitler. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=77.36s)]
*  Nothing to lose. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=78.36s)]
*  That's the outright honest articulation of not just Senator Lindsey Graham's worldview, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=79.36s)]
*  but a worldview that's shared by folks in the upper echelons of the Republican Party, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=83.24s)]
*  those around Donald Trump, perhaps most worryingly appears to be shared by some key members of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=87.0s)]
*  the Biden administration and its foreign policy apparatus, as well as the top levels of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=92.92s)]
*  Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=98.32s)]
*  Iran's aggression, if it's not checked, will endanger every single country in the Middle [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=103.0s)]
*  East and many, many countries in the rest of the world because Iran seeks to impose [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=109.2s)]
*  its radicalism well beyond the Middle East. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Responsible governments should not only support Israel in rolling back Iran's aggression, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=118.8s)]
*  they should join Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=123.88s)]
*  All this is giving me a sinking feeling of deja vu, I've got to say. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=127.28s)]
*  If you remember the aftermath of September 11th, things took a very similar trajectory. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. went to war with Afghanistan immediately after attacks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=134.2s)]
*  Taliban was sheltering al-Qaeda who had attacked us, but that was not enough. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=138.0s)]
*  A lot of people in the United States government abroad wanted a confrontation with Iraq for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=142.68s)]
*  a very long time, and at this moment they saw an opportunity to expand the conflict [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=146.28s)]
*  there as well. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=150.64s)]
*  Months before 9-11, then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote an internal White House [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  memo advocating for potential conflict with Iraq, and just hours after 9-11 attacks, Rumsfeld [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=156.8s)]
*  was ready to manufacture justification to do just that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=163.68s)]
*  Here are contemporaneous notes from one of Rumsfeld's aides recounting conversations [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=167.64s)]
*  with him on 9-11, just hours after attacks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=171.64s)]
*  Hard to get a good case, need to move swiftly, near-term target needs, go massive, sweep [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=182.56s)]
*  it all up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=188.56s)]
*  Things related and not need to do so to get anything useful. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=189.92s)]
*  Things related and not. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  Donald Rumsfeld eventually got what he's looking for. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  We bombed Afghanistan, we changed the regime of Afghanistan, and then before that was done [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=199.72s)]
*  in any sense, we then started another war. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  We pivoted the war that he really wanted, the one he really wanted in Iraq. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  And the exact same people were there cheerleading that war every step of the way. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=210.32s)]
*  We need to get on with the idea of disarming him and having a regime change because it's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=216.76s)]
*  in our national interest. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=221.76s)]
*  I believe that Saddam Hussein is beginning, giving aid and comfort, training and assistance [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=223.56s)]
*  to al Qaeda murderers, that he has weapons of mass destruction. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  He is lying when he says he doesn't, and he will never voluntarily disarm. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=232.38s)]
*  Five hundred inspectors, five thousand inspectors are not going to make him disarm. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=237.12s)]
*  He is a danger to our country and the world. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=241.2s)]
*  He has killed his own people and you're not going to disarm him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=243.48s)]
*  But diplomacy is going to take force. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=246.84s)]
*  Where hawks like Lindsey Graham even brought in a friend, then a private citizen, Benjamin [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=250.88s)]
*  Netanyahu, who just finished his first term as Israeli prime minister to make his case [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  before Congress why a U.S. invasion of Iraq would be a good choice. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=258.8s)]
*  The connection is not whether Iraq was directly connected to September 11th, but how do you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  prevent the next September 11th? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=268.32s)]
*  It's not a question of whether Iraq's regime should be taken out, but when should it be [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=270.12s)]
*  taken out? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=274.04s)]
*  If you take out Saddam, Saddam's regime, I guarantee that it will have enormous positive [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=275.04s)]
*  reverberations on the region. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=282.08s)]
*  Enormous positive reverberations. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=285.52s)]
*  Don't worry, he guarantees. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=286.52s)]
*  That was on September 12th, 2002, a day after the first anniversary of September 11th. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=288.76s)]
*  And we now know that taking out Saddam Hussein did not have enormous positive reverberations [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=293.68s)]
*  on the region. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=297.8s)]
*  In fact, it was the biggest single strategic boost to Iran in a generation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  It gave way to the rise of ISIS, expanded Iranian influence and control, and made the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=304.0s)]
*  entire region, including Israel, less safe. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=308.24s)]
*  It also cost hundreds of thousands of lives. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=311.1s)]
*  People that are like you and me, they are no different, who had the misfortune of being [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=315.72s)]
*  born in the wrong region at the wrong time, where the chaos that we unleashed destroyed [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  their world. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=325.6s)]
*  The war in Iraq was a moral and strategic disaster. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=327.36s)]
*  And yet here we are two decades later doing it all again. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  The year after Hamas's October 7th attack on Israel, the suffering in Gaza has no end [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  in sight. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=339.8s)]
*  There's over 40,000 dead. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=340.8s)]
*  There's unbearable misery across the entire strip of land. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=342.04s)]
*  There's illness and desperation and death and destruction and children dying day after [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=345.44s)]
*  day after day after day and no hope for a ceasefire, no hope for a deal to bring those [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  hostages home who were still there a year later. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  There's a regional war that has now sprawled into Lebanon. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=359.88s)]
*  But the war hawks are not satisfied. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=363.84s)]
*  All the attention is now turning towards what Benjamin Netanyahu and Lindsey Graham and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=365.4s)]
*  so many others, including I think some of the Biden administration, have wanted for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  a while. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=373.4s)]
*  That's war with Iran. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=374.4s)]
*  We're watching it happen in slow motion. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=375.4s)]
*  It is absolute madness to do it all again. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGehBVq5DE&t=379.15999999999997s)]
