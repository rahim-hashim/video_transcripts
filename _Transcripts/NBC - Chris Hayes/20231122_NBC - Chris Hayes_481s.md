# 'Unheard of': Trump attacks led to 'serious and credible' death threats to court
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U)
*  Today, new documents in the New York fraud case against Donald Trump reveal that the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=0.0s)]
*  ex-president's attacks on the judge's clerk resulted in, and I'm quoting here, hundreds [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=6.0s)]
*  of threatening and harassing messages against her. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=11.0s)]
*  According to this filing by an officer in the court's Judicial Threats Assessment Unit, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=14.24s)]
*  the clerk's personal information, including her personal cell phone number, had been compromised [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=18.16s)]
*  resulting in daily doxing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  She has been subject to, on a daily basis, harassing, disparaging comments and anti-Semitic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=25.36s)]
*  tropes, which the officer notes increased in number when Donald Trump violated a gag [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=30.28s)]
*  order aimed at preventing him from making public comments about the court staff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=35.16s)]
*  A New York appeals court issued a pause on that gag order last week, which will remain [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=39.6s)]
*  in place at least for Monday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=43.32s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal analyst. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=44.96s)]
*  Catherine Christian is a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=47.36s)]
*  and they both join me now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=51.56s)]
*  Lisa, let me just start with you on who made this filing and what context did we get this information? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=53.36s)]
*  So we got this filing on behalf of Judge Nguyen, made by the Office of Court Administration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=59.08s)]
*  There's a lawyer there who is effectively representing him in this proceeding. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=64.36s)]
*  And you might ask, why does he need his own lawyer here? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=67.92s)]
*  It's because this isn't an ordinary appeal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=70.32s)]
*  This is a particular type of lawsuit in New York State where you can sue a governmental [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=72.4s)]
*  official for unconstitutional or unlawful actions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=77.28s)]
*  So what Trump is doing here is suing Judge Nguyen Goren himself, and therefore the Office [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=81.28s)]
*  of Court Administration is stepping in as his lawyer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=86.4s)]
*  The affirmation that you're referring to was filed by basically the equivalent of a police [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=89.56s)]
*  officer for the court system who works for the Judicial Threats Assessment Unit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=94.16s)]
*  You worked in New York City in the court system. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=99.04s)]
*  Still do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=102.12s)]
*  And still do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=103.12s)]
*  This kind of thing directed at a clerk of the court. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=105.68s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing, right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=109.6s)]
*  So if you run for district attorney in Manhattan, you're going to take some incoming, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=110.64s)]
*  Like there's going to be people saying nasty things about you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=115.28s)]
*  You may have to worry a little bit about security. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=117.96s)]
*  But you know that when you're doing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=120.46s)]
*  Not to say that it's okay, but it's just a little bit of a different thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  A court clerk, like have you ever encountered a situation in the time that you've worked [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  in the New York City court system of that level of public harassment targeted at someone [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=129.84s)]
*  like that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  Unheard of. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  A judge's law clerk, it's just, I don't want to say they're a potted plant. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  But when you go to court as a lawyer, you don't really, you don't deal with the law [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  clerk. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes judges will have the law clerk speak to the attorneys to help with settlement. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  But it's the judge that makes the decision. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  So in this case, not just Donald Trump, to have the lawyers that have been attacking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=150.74s)]
*  this law clerk is just unprecedented. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=157.24s)]
*  It's just unheard of. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  And it's not just, you know, it's one thing if you're this clerk, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=160.94s)]
*  And you have been against your will, elevated to a public figure by one of the most, you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  know, the biggest platforms in the person Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=170.16s)]
*  It's one thing for people to say nasty things about you out in the world and the Internet. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=173.96s)]
*  It's horrible, but that's one level. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=178.28s)]
*  What's revealed in this filing is that like she's getting 50 phone calls a day or something. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=180.96s)]
*  I mean, her like her life is disrupted. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=185.32s)]
*  Yeah, she's been doxxed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Her address is in the public domain. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=189.14s)]
*  Her personal emails have been compromised. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=191.44s)]
*  Her personal cell phone has been compromised. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=193.62s)]
*  She gets dozens of messages, as you mentioned, on her social media, her personal email and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  her personal cell phone every day. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=200.28s)]
*  And the threatening phone messages and voicemails that have been directed at the judge and the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=203.12s)]
*  clerk combined fill 275 single spaced pages as transcribed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=208.0s)]
*  To me, that was the thing about this filing that stood out the most was just the sheer [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  volume of the hate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=218.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, but this is just this is unacceptable, entirely unacceptable. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=220.12s)]
*  Like we can't I'm sorry. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=226.44s)]
*  We cannot run a system like this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=227.64s)]
*  It cannot be the case that you can use the leverage or platform to essentially like by [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  other means, paint a target of intimidation upon like a court. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=236.04s)]
*  This is like I feel like I'm reading about some dystopian state where the rule of law [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  has unraveled. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=243.2s)]
*  And it shows this is proof. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=244.92s)]
*  If you want proof that Donald Trump's words when he attacks someone has the effect of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=246.5s)]
*  encouraging threatening behavior threatens. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=251.16s)]
*  This is proof. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=254.64s)]
*  This poor law clerk here, who he puts her photo up and he also linked to her personal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=255.64s)]
*  Instagram on that social media. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=260.8s)]
*  And it just started and it hasn't stopped. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  This also just seems a real test of me for me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=265.84s)]
*  I mean, you've got you've got the protective order that Judge Chuckin issued, which is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=268.28s)]
*  now being appealed and working its way through. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  And again, Donald Trump is the amazing example of you get as much process on the U.S. system [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=274.0s)]
*  of justice as you can afford. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  Not everyone gets this much process, but Donald Trump does, which fine, great. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=280.2s)]
*  That's his constitutional right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=283.52s)]
*  I wish everyone had it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  But like that's working its way up. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  This someone's got to draw some real hard lines here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  I really feel like I'm watching this like ridiculous testing thing happening where I [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=290.32s)]
*  can see what's happening. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=294.88s)]
*  I can see what the threat is like. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=295.88s)]
*  I don't I don't know why I'm getting worked up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=297.96s)]
*  I just find this like completely unbearable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=300.08s)]
*  Well, Chris, you know that I've been sitting in this courtroom for weeks and days on that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=301.84s)]
*  And I've been watching this trial and to watch that law clerk and Judge and Goran come to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=305.88s)]
*  do their jobs every day and steal themselves to preside over a trial in which they are [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=310.24s)]
*  daily attacked is really hard, hard to watch. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=315.12s)]
*  But in terms of drawing lines, it shouldn't also be the case that you only get to make [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=319.56s)]
*  this showing if you're represented by the court system. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, in some respects, Judge and Goran and his law clerk were very lucky in that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=327.12s)]
*  there is a police officer who is able to dimension the size and scope of the threat. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=330.88s)]
*  Yes, but Fonny Willis had some trouble yesterday in a similar hearing with respect to Harrison [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=336.64s)]
*  Floyd and his bond revocation because he's one of the co-defendants in that Georgia [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  Rico case. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  He's a publicist who's associated with that weird episode in which a woman went down to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  try to get the the two election poll workers to falsely confess. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=352.64s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=357.56s)]
*  And she had some trouble demonstrating yesterday that Harrison Floyd's posts about this woman, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=358.64s)]
*  Ruby Freeman, an election worker, were in fact threats. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=365.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=368.12s)]
*  Because there's nobody appointed by the government who was writing them down or transcribing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=369.12s)]
*  them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=373.0s)]
*  And it shouldn't be the case that you should have to report to police or get the police [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=374.0s)]
*  involved for a judge to believe that's a credible threat that violates conditions of release [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=376.6s)]
*  or a gag order that's in place. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=383.36s)]
*  I mean, look, the First Amendment is really important and there are novel First Amendment [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=385.32s)]
*  issues here with the person who's running for president of the court. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=388.64s)]
*  There is and I really I pay deference to those. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=390.88s)]
*  But there's something insidious here, Catherine, that it's like when Trump tweets Mike Pence [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  didn't have the courage while the mob is overfilling the Capitol, he knows what he's doing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=398.72s)]
*  We all know what he's doing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=402.56s)]
*  In some technical sense, you could say like he didn't technically tell the mob, go try [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=404.0s)]
*  to kill that dude. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=409.68s)]
*  But like two plus two does equal four. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=411.88s)]
*  And he's doing the same thing here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=414.04s)]
*  And someone has to be able to say two plus two equals four. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=415.48s)]
*  We now have what we call a pattern of behavior with Donald Trump. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  You sort of put all the pieces together, say that constantly about Mike Pence. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=421.6s)]
*  And then what do we hear? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=425.64s)]
*  Hang Mike Pence and the Secret Service has to take him away. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=426.64s)]
*  So he constantly does this drumbeat. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=430.2s)]
*  I hope that the D.C. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=433.32s)]
*  Circuit reads this affidavit that was filed in this New York Appellate Division. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=434.6s)]
*  And, you know, they'll you know, the judges pay attention and we'll see what the cause [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=439.68s)]
*  and effect is when Donald Trump speaks. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=446.8s)]
*  We're waiting on that order out of the D.C. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=449.88s)]
*  Circuit as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  We're waiting on a resolution on this lawsuit against Judge Angora, Lisa Rubin and Katherine [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=455.24s)]
*  Christian. Great to have you both. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj9A8HCV_U&t=459.56s)]
