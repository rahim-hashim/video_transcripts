Video Description: While Donald Trump's adult children are still free to invoke the Fifth Amendment in their upcoming testimony in the Trump civil fraud trail in New York, the protections it offers are not as absolute in a civil trial as they are in a criminal trial. Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney, talks with Chris Hayes about the difference and why it matters.

# Fifth Amendment less protective for Trump's adult children set to testify in civil fraud trial
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU)
*  They see what Joe Biden's doing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=0.0s)]
*  You see the checks. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=2.4s)]
*  You see the wire transfers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=3.48s)]
*  You wonder why the grandchildren are getting checks [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=4.92s)]
*  from the Chinese government. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=7.36s)]
*  You know, those are all reasonable questions, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=8.92s)]
*  and yet no one asks them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=11.08s)]
*  Our mainstream media, the people in D.C., unwilling to ask it, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=13.44s)]
*  but they want to throw Trump in jail for 1,000 years [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=16.36s)]
*  and or the death penalty. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=18.32s)]
*  It truly is sick stuff, but this is why we fight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=20.36s)]
*  That was Donald Trump's son, Don Jr., [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=23.52s)]
*  giving his attempt at a rendition of a coherent argument [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=25.48s)]
*  last night on Newsmax, having a bit of trouble. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=29.8s)]
*  No one wants the death penalty for Donald Trump, I think. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=32.28s)]
*  But there's no evidence the Chinese government [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=34.24s)]
*  sent secret checks or wire transfers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=36.28s)]
*  to President Biden's grandchildren. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=38.2s)]
*  Patently false. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=39.52s)]
*  The claim that the press and people in D.C., [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  presumably prosecutors trying Donald Trump's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  various criminal cases, want to hand the former president [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=43.88s)]
*  the death penalty. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=46.52s)]
*  Not true. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=47.84s)]
*  Nevertheless, that guy, that incredibly adept [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  rhetorician, Don Jr., who's been making the rounds [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=55.56s)]
*  on right-wing media, spewing false claims, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=58.92s)]
*  rambling incoherently, that dude is scheduled [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=60.6s)]
*  to take the witness stand tomorrow in Manhattan, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=63.6s)]
*  in a courtroom, sworn to tell the whole truth. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=66.04s)]
*  As part of a $250 million civil fraud trial [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  where he, his father, his brother, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=71.16s)]
*  and other Trump executives at the Trump work [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=72.68s)]
*  were already found liable of fraudulently [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=75.08s)]
*  inflating the values of properties and other assets. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=77.28s)]
*  This ongoing bench trial, which means there's no jury, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=80.08s)]
*  it's a judge, will determine the amount of the damages. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=82.2s)]
*  Don Jr. brother, Eric, will also take the witness stand, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  likely on Thursday, though it could happen [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=87.96s)]
*  as soon as tomorrow. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=89.64s)]
*  Next week, Donald Trump himself is set to appear [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  on the witness stand, as well as his daughter, Ivanka. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Barbara McQuaid is a former U.S. attorney [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=95.88s)]
*  for the Eastern District of Michigan [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  and an MSNBC legal analyst, and she joins me now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=98.88s)]
*  So let's start here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  It's sort of wild the whole family's gonna sit for this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=103.52s)]
*  I guess the first question is, obviously you have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=106.88s)]
*  an absolute constitutional right against self-incrimination [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=109.44s)]
*  under the Fifth Amendment. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  That can be invoked at any time, even in civil proceedings. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=113.88s)]
*  We saw people do it during some of the questioning [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  in the January 6th committee testimony. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  Do we have any anticipation that any of them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  will invoke that right in their testimony [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=126.72s)]
*  in this civil trial? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=129.4s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, I think it's quite possible. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=132.0s)]
*  During their depositions, Donald Trump and Eric Trump [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=133.96s)]
*  invoked their Fifth Amendment rights [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=136.88s)]
*  against self-incrimination in this case 400 and 500 times. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, as you point out, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  there is no criminal exposure in this case [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=145.8s)]
*  because it's a civil case, but of course, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=148.0s)]
*  anytime you say something under oath in court, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=150.12s)]
*  it can be used against you anywhere, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  including any subsequent criminal prosecution. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=155.0s)]
*  So that's why it might be something that they wanna do, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  rather than lie and commit perjury or say something [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=160.44s)]
*  that might expose themselves to criminal prosecution. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=163.68s)]
*  But one thing that's really different in a civil case [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=166.44s)]
*  from a criminal case, where the fact finders instructed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  that you may not use against a person in any way [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=171.56s)]
*  the fact that they've invoked their Fifth Amendment right [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  against self-incrimination, in a civil case like this one, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=176.88s)]
*  the fact finder, Judge Engeron, can use the fact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=180.32s)]
*  of the invocation of the Fifth Amendment [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  as an adverse inference against the person who cited it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  So if someone's asked a question and they say, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=189.2s)]
*  I invoke my Fifth Amendment, the judge can say, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=191.72s)]
*  oh, I guess that answer would have been pretty bad. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=193.64s)]
*  And so that's the consequence in a civil case like this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  So a lot of strategic decision-making [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=198.72s)]
*  that will need to take place by these Trump children. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=200.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a crucial difference. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=202.96s)]
*  I just wanna stay on it for a second [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=204.52s)]
*  in case people aren't processing that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  In a criminal trial, you cannot, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  and it's bedrock important part [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=209.68s)]
*  of American jurisprudence, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  You can't put someone on the stage and be like, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  did you do it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=215.0s)]
*  And then if they say, I take the Fifth, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=215.84s)]
*  well, see, you have something to hide. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=218.52s)]
*  In a civil context in which there isn't [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=221.12s)]
*  the state's criminal apparatus hanging over someone, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  the invocation of the Fifth can be understood [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=227.72s)]
*  as an adverse admission of something, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  or at least taken as, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=232.72s)]
*  you can make an inference about what the answer [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=235.96s)]
*  would have been in that case. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=238.0s)]
*  It's in this case, it's the judge who would do so. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=238.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=242.48s)]
*  Because there's no jury in this case. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=243.44s)]
*  It's a judge who's the fact finder. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=244.92s)]
*  Sometimes judges are able to compartmentalize [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=246.84s)]
*  a little better than juries are. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=250.36s)]
*  And so maybe this judge just disregards it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=251.92s)]
*  But in a criminal case, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=254.88s)]
*  all of that invocation of the Fifth Amendment [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=256.36s)]
*  is done off stage. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=258.04s)]
*  Outside the presence of the jury, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=259.28s)]
*  a defendant is asked whether he plans to testify [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=261.44s)]
*  or not testify so that the jury doesn't see [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=263.52s)]
*  that awkward moment where the defendant invokes [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  They simply don't take the stand, and they're instructed, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=271.47999999999996s)]
*  they are not to hold it against the defendant in any way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=273.64s)]
*  In a civil case, not so much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=276.52s)]
*  The person comes on the stand, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=277.96s)]
*  they may answer a handful of questions, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=279.32s)]
*  they may invoke the Fifth against a handful of questions. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=281.28s)]
*  It may be one question, it may be many. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  So, but the judge is free to draw that inference. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=285.52s)]
*  Yeah, our understanding is that Don Jr. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=288.28s)]
*  is expected to be grilled by lawyers [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  from State Attorney General Leticia James' office [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  about his involvement in and knowledge [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=296.11999999999995s)]
*  of financial statements the attorney general [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=297.88s)]
*  alleges were grossly inflated. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=300.08s)]
*  That's the topic of that questioning, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  and we're gonna just have to all stay tuned [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  to see how they handle it, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=305.44s)]
*  whether he tries to sort of defend himself, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=306.88s)]
*  whether he invokes the Fifth, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  whether he does some combination of the two. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=310.4s)]
*  It's gonna be very interesting to see [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  how they make those decisions. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  Barb McQuade, as always, thank you very much. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=315.11999999999995s)]
*  And thank you for joining us. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKPIYlbyIU&t=317.36s)]
