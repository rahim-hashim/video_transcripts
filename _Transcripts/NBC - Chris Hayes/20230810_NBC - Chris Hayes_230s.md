# ‘Nightmare’ Deadly wildfires ravage Hawaii island of Maui
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI)
*  It is the hottest summer on record and Hawaii is burning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=0.0s)]
*  The islands are one of the most remote inhabited places in the entire world, sitting more than [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=4.16s)]
*  2,300 miles from California to the east, nearly 4,000 miles from Japan to the west. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=7.76s)]
*  Right now, wildfires are ravaging the state. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=13.48s)]
*  You've probably seen some of these terrifying scenes that have come out of California in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=16.84s)]
*  the past few years, but they're now tearing through the island of Maui. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=19.88s)]
*  This is what it looked like yesterday as the fires destroyed businesses in Lahaina, an [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  area rich with native Hawaiian history. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=29.16s)]
*  Nearly 2,000 buildings have been burned down, 53 deaths confirmed on Maui. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=31.68s)]
*  A number of the governor now says he expects to rise in updates just later tonight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=37.84s)]
*  The state office of emergency management says it is still trying to get a handle on the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=42.96s)]
*  fires as thousands of tourists and residents rush to evacuate the island. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=47.08s)]
*  Airlines are canceling flights to Maui, repurposing those planes to assist in the evacuations. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=51.84s)]
*  The fires are the result of a number of factors, from invasive plant species and grasslands [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=57.28s)]
*  to drought. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  They come as atmospheric carbon is producing record heat in a climate far more extreme [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  and unstable than any of us have experienced in our lifetimes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=68.2s)]
*  Senator Mazie Hirono is a Democrat representing Hawaii, and she joins me now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=73.44s)]
*  Senator, first of all, I just want to say that everyone in the country is watching these [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=77.68s)]
*  scenes appalled and sending support to the state of Hawaii. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  I know it's brutal there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=86.36s)]
*  What's your read from what you're hearing from the folks you're in touch with? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=87.92s)]
*  First of all, we want to thank everyone for the support that they want to provide to people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=94.2s)]
*  of Hawaii. And they can certainly go to Maui County dot gov. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  But and they will direct you to ways that you can help. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=103.56s)]
*  But, Chris, it's very clear that we are all experiencing the frequency and severity of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=107.0s)]
*  major weather events such as hurricanes, flooding, drought, tornadoes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=113.4s)]
*  And we had Hurricane Dora, which did tremendously created tremendous windy conditions [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  that caused the flames on Maui to spread in unpredictable ways. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  So climate change is something that we are experiencing on a regular basis. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=132.0s)]
*  And it certainly exacerbated the damage that is happening on Maui. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=136.52s)]
*  But we thank everyone for their good wishes and support. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=141.24s)]
*  I mean, on Maui, you've got you've got an entire town with rich, obviously, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=146.0s)]
*  native Hawaiian history was once, if I understand correctly, the capital of the Hawaiian [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  kingdom has been essentially leveled. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=157.44s)]
*  Obviously, the islands are going to need a lot of a lot of help in reconstruction. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  Very much so. And that's why it's all hands on deck with the county, the state, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=166.04s)]
*  federal government. And right now we have what we call the family of federal agencies [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=170.64s)]
*  that are either on the island or getting there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=176.64s)]
*  So this would be, of course, FEMA, the Department of Defense, Transportation, Energy, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=179.44s)]
*  Agriculture, Army Corps of Engineers. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=185.64s)]
*  And I expect the SBA Administrator Guzman to be on Maui. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=188.44s)]
*  I will be accompanying her if she is able to come because the recovery is going to be long. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=194.44s)]
*  We're going to need all the support that we can get for our homeowners and our businesses. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  And SBA is very much a part of that kind of recovery. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khndvMHdTbI&t=205.83999999999997s)]
