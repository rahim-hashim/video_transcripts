# The truth behind the Trump-Vance ‘concepts of a plan’ on health care
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc)
*  In the past decade, the Affordable Care Act has gotten health coverage to almost 50 million Americans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans have gotten their butts kicked fighting it so many times, you could be forgiven for thinking they've given up repealing it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=4.0s)]
*  But they haven't. They're hoping to take away a key feature that makes it all work. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=10.0s)]
*  JD Vance explained how on the campaign trail last week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=15.0s)]
*  We're going to actually implement some regulatory reform in the health care system that allows people to choose a health care plan that works for them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=19.0s)]
*  Now what that will also do is allow people with similar health situations to be in the same risk pools. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=27.0s)]
*  So that makes our health care system work better. It makes it work better for the people with chronic issues. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=33.0s)]
*  It also also makes makes it work better for everybody else. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=38.0s)]
*  It doesn't make it work better for the people with chronic issues. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=41.0s)]
*  In fact, if you stick people in different risk pools, depending on their pre-existing conditions, chronic issues, that sounds familiar, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=44.0s)]
*  It's because it was part of the Republican House attempt to repeal and replace EACA all the way back in 2017. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=50.0s)]
*  I remember I covered it night in night out. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=56.0s)]
*  A tiered system of insurance, the Congressional Budget Office said, would create a situation for people with expensive conditions in which premiums would be so high in some areas that the plans would have no enrollment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=58.0s)]
*  The whole point of health insurance is that premiums from healthy people help subsidize benefits for people with chronic conditions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=69.0s)]
*  If you start segregating by risk, well, that's great for young, healthy people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=78.0s)]
*  They'll pay less because they'll need less. They need less care. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=82.0s)]
*  But if you're old or sick, your premiums are going to skyrocket. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=85.0s)]
*  And the thing about human life is that all of us will go from one category to the other, which is why you want one risk pool. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=88.0s)]
*  So Trump and Vance's concept of a plan is to go back to the exact same bad idea Americans have rejected over and over again for the last 10 years. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=97.0s)]
*  Javier Becerra has served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services of the Biden administration since 2021, and he joins me now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=106.0s)]
*  Secretary, it's good to have you here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=113.0s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=114.0s)]
*  Let's just talk about the structure of the EACA. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=115.0s)]
*  Just as a matter of policy, as the man who probably more than any other individual in the government oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=116.0s)]
*  What would happen if you changed it structurally so that you started segregating out different risk pools? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=125.0s)]
*  What would happen was we would see what we saw before 1965 when President Johnson enacted Medicare. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=133.0s)]
*  Old people had a hard time finding insurance. Why? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=139.0s)]
*  Because, as you said, if you're old, you're probably getting sicker faster more often and you're costing an insurance company more. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=143.0s)]
*  So insurers did not want to insure older Americans. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=150.0s)]
*  It was it took Medicare, where the federal government came back and financed and backed up the system to finally get 65 and older Medicare health care coverage. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=154.0s)]
*  Right. Because like, why do you want to take premiums from a 69-year-old or 72-year-old? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=163.0s)]
*  Right. You don't. You want a 21-year-old. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=168.0s)]
*  As you said, you want these healthiest, youngest, wealthiest people to be on your plans. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=170.0s)]
*  And in fact, the old system sort of worked through this kind of cherry picking. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=176.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, even after you have Medicare, right, so people 65 or older are in that pool. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=181.0s)]
*  But I remember looking at some of the ACA repeal plans estimating premiums for someone who's 63. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=185.0s)]
*  Right. And maybe has had some health issues. You're looking at $20,000 a year, $26,000 a year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=192.0s)]
*  Like, there's no way to make the math work. Is there? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=197.0s)]
*  No. What happens is people will pool to where they can pay least. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=200.0s)]
*  And if you're 26 years of age, you're not going to go in with someone who's 56 years of age. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=205.0s)]
*  And so what happens is all those 50-year-olds are going to be stuck in plans that are very expensive because nobody wants to be pooled with them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=210.0s)]
*  And the ACA made sure we prevented that. That's why we have the protection against preexisting conditions. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=218.0s)]
*  You cannot watch an insurance company say to you, Chris, I'm not going to insure you because you have an existing condition which would cost a lot of money. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=223.0s)]
*  You cannot discriminate that way anymore. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=232.0s)]
*  Just to be clear, you couldn't – I actually don't know the answer to the question. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=235.0s)]
*  Could you – what Vance is proposing or what others are proposing, could you do that administratively from the helm of HHS or you'd have to pass something, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=239.0s)]
*  I think something – we couldn't do it that way. Well, certainly not – [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=249.0s)]
*  The law requires what's called community rating and the law requires this regulation of insurance companies, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=252.0s)]
*  And the law doesn't allow you to pool the way that I think they're speaking about because it would be discriminatory. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=257.0s)]
*  It would now be based – [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=264.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. So they'd have to change the law. You can't do it from the executive position. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=266.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=270.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you another question about a public health crisis we've been battling in this country, and I think it's gotten not that much attention. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=271.0s)]
*  It's overdose deaths. Now, it's almost impossible to articulate the insanity of the growth of overdose deaths. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=277.0s)]
*  I think in – I was reading a piece today by David Walliswells in The Times. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=286.0s)]
*  I think in 1982, it was like a thousand overdose deaths total in the country. Last year it was about 100,000. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=295.0s)]
*  Right? That said, we have new data on overdose deaths that have continued to drop. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=296.0s)]
*  They're now at their lowest level in three years. There has been progress over the last few years of overdose deaths. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=301.0s)]
*  What do you attribute that progress to? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=307.0s)]
*  Remember that many of the Americans who are dying today are dying without expecting to die. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=309.0s)]
*  These are not folks who are so addicted that there's no – eventually they were going to overdose. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=314.0s)]
*  These are Americans who in many cases are taking a particular drug, don't realize that it's laced with something like fentanyl. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=321.0s)]
*  The fentanyl ends up killing them. That's why you see such high overdose rates. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=328.0s)]
*  We are beginning to see a drop, I think, because we have – in this administration, we decided to tackle overdose in three important ways [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=332.0s)]
*  and then added one new one. Obviously, prevention, treatment, and then follow-up care. But we added a fourth component, harm reduction. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=343.0s)]
*  If you are about to take a drug because you're addicted and if you can check to find out if it's laced with fentanyl, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=350.0s)]
*  it might stop you from taking that drug if you find out, oh my God, I realize this drug is laced with fentanyl. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=357.0s)]
*  Fentanyl strips, which are out there today in many, many programs, the federal government would prohibit programs from getting federal dollars [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=362.0s)]
*  if they provided fentanyl strips. We have said the evidence proves that you can save a life by giving someone a fentanyl strip [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=370.0s)]
*  so they can find out if fentanyl is laced in their drug. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=377.0s)]
*  You know, this harm reduction, we've had – I've covered multiple iterations of the harm reduction debate. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=379.0s)]
*  I remember people demagoguing on needle exchanges and things like this during HIV. Fentanyl strips seem to me like an obviously sensible thing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=385.0s)]
*  Simply. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=392.0s)]
*  Has there been – has this been a controversial program or not? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=393.0s)]
*  On the ground, no, because it's saving lives. At the federal level, because you get into this politic of drugs and so forth, yes, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=397.0s)]
*  but it's proving itself a winner. And today, more people are living. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=404.0s)]
*  We've also made naloxone more available to folks so that if you're ODing, somebody finds you there, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=408.0s)]
*  you can provide them with a drug that will help reverse that overdose. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=413.0s)]
*  Yeah, naloxone being a drug that can interrupt and stop an overdose, but has to be given essentially within a few minutes of the actual – [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=417.0s)]
*  And so now that's available over the counter. That wasn't before, but this administration has made it available so we can save lives. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=424.0s)]
*  Secretary of Health and Human Services Javier Becerra. Thank you so much for coming by. Come by the studio anytime. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=431.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=437.0s)]
*  Join New York. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=438.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=439.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo23YjzYlc&t=454.0s)]
