# ‘Remarkable’: GOP voters not convinced by Pence's Jan. 6 defense
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Mike Pence is in the very first presidential contest state of Iowa tonight in the midst of a three day campaign swing there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=0.0s)]
*  And while there is nothing more predictable than a former vice president making his own run for the White House, Mike Pence is of course in a rather unique position. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=9.0s)]
*  Not only was he number two to the twice impeached, twice indicted ex-president Donald Trump, he is now running against his former boss for the Republican nomination. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=18.0s)]
*  I have to say Mike Pence has always struck me as a somewhat ridiculous figure. He always sounds like he's doing a bad impersonation of a politician. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=28.0s)]
*  But his biggest obstacle in the Republican primary is that the voters do not seem to like him very much. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=37.0s)]
*  Despite his real advantage on name recognition, just seven percent of Republican primary voters say they would vote for Pence if the primary election were held today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=43.0s)]
*  And this is even more damning for him. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=52.0s)]
*  Thirty seven percent have a negative opinion of the former vice president compared to 33 percent of primary voters who view him positively, according to that same NBC News poll. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=54.0s)]
*  That's what we call in the business underwater unfavorability. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=65.0s)]
*  There's a very clear reason for that. Donald Trump, the still quite popular front runner for the Republican nomination, blames Mike Pence. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=69.0s)]
*  On January 6th and over and over and over again in the two and a half years since then, Trump has told his followers that it was Mike Pence's fault that Trump wasn't able to pull off his coup. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=78.0s)]
*  The morning of the insurrection in front of an angry crowd gathered at the Stop the Steal rally, Trump made one last appeal to Pence that sounded more like a threat. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=89.0s)]
*  Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=100.0s)]
*  And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=108.0s)]
*  And gone by the president, a violent mob hell bent on finding Pence, then marched to the Capitol. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=113.0s)]
*  As we know, they broke in and they ransacked the building, roaming the halls and chanting Hang Mike Pence, Hang Mike Pence. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=119.0s)]
*  Someone even erected a gallows with the noose outside of the building. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=126.0s)]
*  As the danger became apparent and imminent, the Secret Service evacuated the vice president from the Senate chamber where he was presiding over the election certification proceedings. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=130.0s)]
*  He eventually moved Pence to an underground parking garage beneath the Capitol where he learned that Donald Trump was attacking him on Twitter. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=139.0s)]
*  He was in this concrete like parking garage and, you know, with his family and I mean, this is the vice president of the United States and he's like holed up in a basement. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=149.0s)]
*  His chief of staff, Mark Short, showing him his phone and it's the tweet of Trump saying Mike Pence didn't have the courage. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=161.0s)]
*  This is the guy who like fled the rioters and Trump is saying he didn't have the courage. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=169.0s)]
*  And you can see it kind of looks like Pence is grimacing, but you can never really tell. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=174.0s)]
*  Donald Trump quite clearly and almost explicitly painted a target on his vice president's back on January 6 when he had every reason to know that he was in physical danger. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=179.0s)]
*  Trump left Pence alone to decide what to do on his own with a mob invading the Capitol. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=190.0s)]
*  Where to go left him furtively making phone calls like this one to speaker Nancy Pelosi. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=196.0s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Vice President. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=203.0s)]
*  Hi, we're OK. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=206.0s)]
*  We're here with Mr. Schumer, Mr. McConnell, the leadership, House and Senate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=208.0s)]
*  And how are you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=212.0s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=215.0s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=216.0s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=219.0s)]
*  I worry about you being in that Capitol. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=220.0s)]
*  Don't let anybody know where you are. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=223.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, at this point, the leadership Pelosi had been evacuated out of that building. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=227.0s)]
*  So when she says, I worried about you being that capital, she's saying you are physically trapped in a building that is being overrun with people that want your death. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=232.0s)]
*  Donald Trump sicked the mob on his own vice president. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=242.0s)]
*  He left him to the walls and he still blames Mike Pence for not doing his bidding that day. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=244.0s)]
*  And so even now, a big contingent of diehard Trump supporters think that Mike Pence is a traitor, even though he's the opposite in the sense that he actually fulfilled his constitutional duty on January 6th. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=250.0s)]
*  And the Republican voters who want to move past Donald Trump, well, they don't like the fact that Pence was a toady on pretty much every other day of his entire term. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=263.0s)]
*  And that leaves Pence pretty much stock with just 7 percent support. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=271.0s)]
*  But ambition makes people do amazing things, doesn't it? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=275.0s)]
*  Crisscrossing the state of Iowa, trying to convince people the mob calling for your death had it all wrong. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=279.0s)]
*  And that's really the task the former vice president set for himself yesterday in Sioux City, Iowa. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=285.0s)]
*  It's a small campaign event, sort of typical thing at a pizza ranch, a meet and greet with the county Republican Party. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=290.0s)]
*  And to be clear, and this is important, this was a room full of rank and file Iowa Republican caucus goers who came to see and speak to Pence. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=295.0s)]
*  It was not some rowdy MAGA crowd at a Trump rally. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=304.0s)]
*  But as you will hear in this clip, one voter did ask about his role on January 6th, as Donald Trump would describe it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=307.0s)]
*  And based on the reaction in the room as Pence entered, the crowd sure seemed pretty skeptical of the broadly true story Pence told. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=313.0s)]
*  If it wasn't for your vote, we would not have Joe Biden in the White House. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=322.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=328.0s)]
*  Joe Biden shouldn't be there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=330.0s)]
*  And all those wonderful things that you and Trump were doing together would be continuing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=332.0s)]
*  And this country would be on the right path. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=338.0s)]
*  Do you ever second guess yourself that was a constitutional right that you had to send those votes back to the states? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=342.0s)]
*  It was not like you were going to personally elect him. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=350.0s)]
*  We all know by the number of votes that were there who won that election. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=354.0s)]
*  You changed history for this country. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=361.0s)]
*  Let me speak to the issue. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=364.0s)]
*  Because I think it's an issue that continues to be misunderstood. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=366.0s)]
*  But I know by God's grace I did exactly what the Constitution of the United States required of me that day. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=370.0s)]
*  I kept my promise. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=377.0s)]
*  Let me be very respectful of the question and tell you, look, states conduct our elections. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=379.0s)]
*  You never want to let Washington, D.C. run elections. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=389.0s)]
*  You certainly would never want one person in Washington, D.C. to decide who's the president of the United States. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=393.0s)]
*  You weren't deciding. You were just sending it back to the states. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=399.0s)]
*  Let me explain it to you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=402.0s)]
*  States conduct elections, Iowa or I live in Indiana. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=404.0s)]
*  And after there were questions in a half a dozen or so states, we had reviews of the results, 60 different lawsuits that went to the courts. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=408.0s)]
*  Where there are questions, there's two ways that they're reviewed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=419.0s)]
*  Number one is you take those issues to the legal process in the state for free counsel. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=422.0s)]
*  Secondly, you take them to the courts, which we did very aggressively. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=427.0s)]
*  Now, there were voting irregularities that took place. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=432.0s)]
*  You had a half a dozen states that changed the rules in the name of COVID. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=435.0s)]
*  But the courts upheld those changes in virtually every instance. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=439.0s)]
*  And in every instance where they would have any impact whatsoever. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=443.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, when Iowa certified your results and sent them to Washington, D.C., when Indiana certified our results, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=447.0s)]
*  the Constitution of the United States in Article 2, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=454.0s)]
*  the job of the vice president is to serve as the presiding officer of a joint session where you open and count the bubbles. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=458.0s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. Go read the Constitution. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=466.0s)]
*  Not really. I say this with great affection and respect. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=469.0s)]
*  The Constitution is very clear. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=472.0s)]
*  My job was to oversee the session of Congress where objections could be heard. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=475.0s)]
*  And I made sure that objections would be recognized so we would hear whatever evidence or whether debate there was. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=481.0s)]
*  But the Constitution says you open and count the votes, no more, no less. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=488.0s)]
*  The Constitution affords no authority to the vice president or anyone else to reject votes or return votes to the states. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=493.0s)]
*  Never been done before. Should never be done in the future. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=501.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's actually what the Constitution says. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=505.0s)]
*  No vice president in American history ever asserted the authority that you have been convinced that I hadn't. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=508.0s)]
*  But I want to tell you, with all due respect, I said before, I said when I announced, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=514.0s)]
*  President Trump is wrong about my authority that day, and he's still wrong. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=519.0s)]
*  I believe it with all my heart. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=524.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not a huge bit of applause, not a rising crescendo, that there are some claps. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=528.0s)]
*  Imagine having to do that at every campaign stop. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=533.0s)]
*  It's a remarkable clip. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=536.0s)]
*  I mean, for a whole bunch of reasons, but just to name a few. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=538.0s)]
*  First of all, what stands out, again, I never thought Mike Pence was a particularly impressive politician, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=541.0s)]
*  but after so many years following Donald Trump, it is just surprising, almost bracing, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=546.0s)]
*  to just hear a politician attempt to persuade people with a series of sequential arguments by drawing on facts, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=551.0s)]
*  making a kind of persuasive point. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=557.0s)]
*  Still, though, it does not feel like that crowd was all that receptive. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=560.0s)]
*  The woman who asked Mike Pence that question later told a reporter she believes Pence is a good man, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=564.0s)]
*  but his decision to not reject the Electoral College votes makes it difficult for her to back him in the upcoming primary. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=569.0s)]
*  Quote, I really do feel like he altered history. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=575.0s)]
*  And that event and that exchange that we just saw is such a clear illustration of not only Mike Pence's problem, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=579.0s)]
*  but our collective political problem right now. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=587.0s)]
*  I mean, here he is in a room with a selection of interested Republican caucus goers in Iowa, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=589.0s)]
*  people who make up the base of one of the two major parties and coalitions, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=593.0s)]
*  and he cannot get them to buy his explanation for why undoing the entire American constitutional order was not the right thing to do. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=597.0s)]
*  I mean, think of that small room and that man having that interaction and watching him try to do it [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=608.0s)]
*  is like watching someone try to drain the ocean with a teacup. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=612.0s)]
*  How many iterations of that spiel would Mike Pence have to have face by face, voter after voter, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=615.0s)]
*  to convince Republican voters of the basic inescapable truth? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=625.0s)]
*  And it really makes you wonder why Pence is even trying at all. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=631.0s)]
*  I mean, again, like I said, ambition makes people do crazy things. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=635.0s)]
*  But I will also say you have to remember that Mike Pence knows the actual facts of what happened on January 6 better than almost anyone. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=637.0s)]
*  He had conversations with Donald Trump that day that no one else had. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=646.0s)]
*  He has also cooperated with special counsel Jack Smith's investigation, testifying before the federal grand jury this year. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=648.0s)]
*  So he probably has a good sense about where that case is going and what it may look like. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=656.0s)]
*  And maybe Mike Pence is making a bet. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0kY5ZZyLlg&t=660.0s)]
