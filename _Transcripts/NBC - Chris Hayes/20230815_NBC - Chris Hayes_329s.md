# Mark Meadows seeks to move Georgia conspiracy case to federal court
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io)
*  I am giving the defendants the opportunity to voluntarily surrender no later than noon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=0.0s)]
*  on Friday, the 25th day of August 2023. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=10.1s)]
*  Yesterday, District Attorney Fonny Willis said all 19 defendants charged with racketeering [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=14.72s)]
*  in Georgia have until next Friday to appear voluntarily in court in Fulton County rather [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=20.2s)]
*  than face arrest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=25.72s)]
*  One of those defendants, Mark Meadows, is already asking the court to move his case [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=27.2s)]
*  to federal court. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=30.96s)]
*  Today, lawyers from Meadows filed that the case should be in a federal court because, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  quote, the contact giving rise to the charges in the indictment all occurred during his [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=35.9s)]
*  tenure and as part of his service as chief of staff to Donald Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=40.46s)]
*  Meadows is the first of the 19 defendants charged in Georgia to file challenge to the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=44.76s)]
*  case, but I think we can safely say he will not be the last. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Anna Bauer is a correspondent for Lawfare, who's been covering the Fulton County investigation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=52.8s)]
*  She watched it all unfold at the courthouse yesterday and she joins me now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=57.52s)]
*  Anna, first of all, I've been following your coverage. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=62.2s)]
*  It's been super useful. So thank you for that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=64.32s)]
*  And second of all, what do you make of the Meadows filing? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=66.56s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=71.08s)]
*  So I make of the Meadows filing that it is very much expected. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=73.16s)]
*  We anticipated that many of these defendants would make their first move, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=77.24s)]
*  move to federal court. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=82.64s)]
*  There is a statute that allows federal or federal officials or formal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  former federal officials to seek to remove state criminal cases [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=89.44s)]
*  to federal court. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=94.44s)]
*  Many of them will likely seek to do that, whether because they want to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=96.36s)]
*  delay proceedings or because they think they will have a friendlier jury pool [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=100.88s)]
*  there. In terms of what I think about Meadows filing, you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=105.52s)]
*  it's it's kind of something that I've talked to a lot of attorneys in Georgia [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  about. And it's something that I've thought a lot about in terms of doing my own [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=115.36s)]
*  research. And I really think he actually does have a pretty good chance of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=119.6s)]
*  removing the case to federal court. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=124.44s)]
*  You know, it's a very low standard. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=126.88s)]
*  All that you have to really show is that you are a federal official who was doing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=128.8s)]
*  something related to your federal duties. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  He kind of says that he was making phone calls as chief of staff and he was setting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  up meetings. And I think that because it's a quite low standard, you just have to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=140.92s)]
*  make a plausible claim. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=146.2s)]
*  Meadows probably does have a pretty good chance of removing it to federal court. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=148.16s)]
*  There seems to be some agreement amongst legal scholars and attorneys in Georgia [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=152.64s)]
*  that that he will have a pretty good chance of it as well, especially considering [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  that the Eleventh Circuit has interpreted the federal removal statute quite [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=162.72s)]
*  liberally. Yeah, let me read from his the filing of his lawyer saying nothing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=166.88s)]
*  Mr. Meadows is alleged in the indictment to have done as criminal per se, arranging [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=172.52s)]
*  over law office meetings, contacting state officials on the president's behalf, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=176.64s)]
*  visiting a state government building, setting up a phone call for the president. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=180.04s)]
*  One would expect a chief of staff to the president. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=183.36s)]
*  I see you do these sorts of things. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=185.28s)]
*  So to your point, they're making the argument this was done in his line with [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=186.8s)]
*  federal duties, although we should note that the allegation in the RICO charges [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=189.64s)]
*  that one of the things he did was illegal per se, which is the solicitation of this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=194.16s)]
*  violation of an oath of a public officer. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=198.92s)]
*  That's that says that that Donald J. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=201.12s)]
*  Trump and Mark Randall Meadows, with the offense of are charged with solicitation of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=203.48s)]
*  violation of oath by a public officer in that call with Brad Raffensperger. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=207.56s)]
*  Should it be removed to federal court, though? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  And here's where I get a little wonky on the law. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  It still gets tried under Georgia law, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=217.6s)]
*  It's not the the the the the sort of venue of jurisprudence changes, but the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=220.84s)]
*  jurisdiction, the state laws, all the stuff that is the undergirding [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  law is still Georgia state law. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=230.88s)]
*  That is correct. It still is. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=234.76s)]
*  Georgia state law charges. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  Fonny Willis and her team will still prosecute the case. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=239.76s)]
*  The only difference is that they will prosecute the case a few blocks down the road at [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  the federal courthouse in the northern district of Georgia in federal court. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Federal procedural rules will largely apply and a federal judge will [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=252.24s)]
*  preside over the case. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=257.08s)]
*  The the defendants who are able to remove will also have a federal jury pool. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=258.6s)]
*  So that's the difference. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=263.6s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that the charges are any different or that the prosecutorial [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=265.16s)]
*  team is any different. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=269.92s)]
*  It won't be federal prosecutors. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=271.56s)]
*  It will still be state prosecutors. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=273.24s)]
*  And importantly, Trump or any other future president will still not be able to pardon [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump under a federal pardon, because, again, these are still state charges if he is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  convicted or if others are convicted. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=288.76s)]
*  That's a really key point. I want to just reiterate that should Meadows be convicted, even [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=291.32s)]
*  after a successful removal of federal court, it's still a Georgia offense. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=295.16s)]
*  It still can't be pardoned by whichever president will come will come later. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=299.44s)]
*  Anna Bauer has been doing fantastic work covering this for lawfare. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThqotn78Io&t=307.35999999999996s)]
