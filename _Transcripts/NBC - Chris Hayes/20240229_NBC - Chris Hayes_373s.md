# Pelosi rips GOP anti-IVF bill: They 'need a lesson in the bird and the bees’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw)
*  Nancy Pelosi had not yet begun her career in politics when the Supreme Court enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion review aid. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=0.0s)]
*  Nearly 50 years later, she was the first female Speaker of the House when the Court overturned Roe, throwing out a half century of progress. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=6.7s)]
*  Under her leadership, the House immediately passed legislation to restore abortion rights nationwide. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=12.9s)]
*  Those efforts went nowhere in the Republican-led Senate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=17.8s)]
*  Now as Speaker of America, Nancy Pelosi continues to fight against the Republican project to eliminate reproductive rights in America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=21.0s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  It's great to have you, Congresswoman. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=29.0s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=30.4s)]
*  Lovely to be with you as we talk about matters that relate to America's families. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=31.8s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask just about this bill because it was so wild to me to watch them all rush out with these statements, which I understood [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=37.0s)]
*  because obviously it was a political crisis. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=46.6s)]
*  I think probably 90 percent of Americans found the Alabama ruling awful. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=48.0s)]
*  And then to just Google the fact that they've got a majority of our co-sponsors on this bill that just plainly does what Alabama does, what the Alabama ruling does. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=52.8s)]
*  Do you think they know that they're on that bill? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=62.0s)]
*  Do you like are they pretending to not know? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=65.8s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=68.4s)]
*  Well, let's see what the title is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=69.2s)]
*  Life at Conception Act. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=72.0s)]
*  So they have to know what that means. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=74.4s)]
*  I've said for years that I think the people on the other side of the aisle need a lesson in the birds and the bees because sometimes they don't seem to understand. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=76.8s)]
*  But the fact is that 125, a majority of the House GOP are co-sponsors of this legislation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=85.8s)]
*  That doesn't mean there aren't more who would be supporting it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  But it comes at an interesting time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=97.8s)]
*  And instead, we have in the House a place for them all to go if they disagree with the Alabama decision. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=100.2s)]
*  Congresswoman Susan Wild of Pennsylvania has early on introduced a bill with Senator Duckworth in the Senate, a corresponding bill called the Access to Family Building Act. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And this would enable families to have a statutory right to have access to the technology and the rest for in vitro fertilization. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=120.8s)]
*  It would also empower the Justice Department to act upon those who would deprive women of those rights and give women a right of private action. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  If someone tried to deprive them of that, it does more. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=140.6s)]
*  But that's the essence of the bill. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=144.0s)]
*  They could easily sign on to this bill to contain their enthusiasm for in vitro fertilization. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=146.0s)]
*  Instead, they have Life at Contraception Act, which is a contradiction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=152.8s)]
*  Well, what's striking here, too, is that I actually think, you know, when you look at Alabama, right, they move very quickly because they understood the politics of it, that it was completely upside down. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=156.8s)]
*  It strikes me as honestly just as a pure political play that a Mike Johnson led House teaming up with the Schumer led Senate to pass legislation that federally protected IVF would probably be a political benefit to Republicans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=166.8s)]
*  But my sense is that there's enough of the caucus that actually doesn't think it's OK that they're not going to move to a vote on that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's hope that that's not the case. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  As you've heard me say again and again, President Lincoln said public sentiment is everything. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  There's nothing more eloquent to a member of Congress than the voice of his or her own constituents. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=195.4s)]
*  Lincoln didn't say that. I'm saying that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=201.8s)]
*  So we want people to weigh in with their members of Congress. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=202.4s)]
*  I've heard from people of faith about Catholics, even nuns, saying this is a gift of God to enable families to have babies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=206.8s)]
*  And they spend their life saying that that's what they want. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=216.0s)]
*  And now when they have that opportunity, they have the life at contraception at Conception Act. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=220.8s)]
*  Let me ask you. Not contraception, mind you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=226.6s)]
*  Only eight of them in the House, eight Republicans in the House voted for women to have a right to contraception. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=228.6s)]
*  That meant one hundred and ninety five of them voted. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=235.9s)]
*  Eight of them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=238.7s)]
*  Women shouldn't have a right to contraception. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=239.2s)]
*  There's a lot going on in Congress this week. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=242.3s)]
*  Mike Johnson is very clearly, I think everyone would agree in over his head. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=245.0s)]
*  I don't even think that's a controversial assessment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=248.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell has announced that he'll be stepping down a Senate majority leader. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=251.1s)]
*  And I thought of you when I saw that announcement because your careers have been both parallel and at times intertwined. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=254.7s)]
*  And I thought, I wonder what Nancy Pelosi thinks about Mitch McConnell's announcement. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=259.9s)]
*  Well, I've worked with Mitch for years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=265.7s)]
*  We had a similar position in the 90s as we had a corresponding role as the top Democrat and top Republican House and Senate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=267.4s)]
*  On the foreign operations of appropriation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=274.9s)]
*  So I've known and worked with him for a long time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=277.2s)]
*  I've disagreed with him a lot. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=279.7s)]
*  In fact, he's wrecked us with the court in terms of women's right to choose and so much else that this rogue court is going down a path of. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=281.7s)]
*  But we've worked on other issues together. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=290.0s)]
*  It's interesting to me, though, if I just may say I for 20 years was in leadership, either this leader of the House or the speaker of the House passed landmark legislation. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  Affordable health care list goes on and on rescue package infrastructure bill as a compact act for our veterans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=304.6s)]
*  I.R.A. to save our planet and to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  Chips bill just to bring some things that are new. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=319.5s)]
*  When I stepped aside, they said she stepped aside, but she's still here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=323.1s)]
*  When he stepped aside, end of an era. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=327.3s)]
*  It's a guy thing. I know. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  But I have to just say for women, we want our proper attention to so in any event, I wish him well in his decision. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  I worry about his health. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=341.0s)]
*  I'm sad for his family's loss recently. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=342.2s)]
*  Elaine losing her sister and we'll just see how it goes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=345.3s)]
*  But a very strategic player in the Congress. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=349.2s)]
*  You [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWp8AWx5emw&t=361.8s)]
