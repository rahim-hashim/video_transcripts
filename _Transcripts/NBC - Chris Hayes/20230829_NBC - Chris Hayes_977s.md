# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 28
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY)
*  So as of this morning, we now have a date for the start of what is possibly the highest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=0.0s)]
*  stakes trial in history, Donald J. Trump's criminal trial for trying to steal the election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=5.04s)]
*  It's going to start on March 4th, which is also the day before Super Tuesday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=11.52s)]
*  This means the Republican front runner will not be rallying supporters at MAGA rallies [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=16.1s)]
*  on the day before 15 states vote. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=19.64s)]
*  Instead, he will be sitting in a federal courtroom in D.C. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=22.12s)]
*  So for a guy who spent the majority of his life controlling the narrative and almost [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=25.84s)]
*  always getting away with things like, say, joking about grabbing women or asking Russia [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=29.56s)]
*  to find Hillary Clinton's emails in 2016, Donald Trump has never faced criminal consequences [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=35.28s)]
*  or real accountability. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't even expect to. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  I mean, remember, he joked about how his supporters would still like him even if he shot someone [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=44.64s)]
*  in the middle of Manhattan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=48.64s)]
*  But that seems like it is changing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=50.3s)]
*  The ex-president wanted a trial date in 2026 and then he got one two years earlier in 2024. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=52.44s)]
*  While Judge Tonya Chutkin flatly rejected his attorney's plea in court this morning, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=59.42s)]
*  Judge Chutkin repeatedly asked Attorney John Lora to come up with a compromise trial date. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=64.08s)]
*  The Trump lawyer refused. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=68.7s)]
*  So Judge Chutkin set one just two months after what the special counsel's office requested. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=70.62s)]
*  Trump seems to have lost control. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  His entire life has been stagecrafted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=77.78s)]
*  But this time, he's not the one in charge of producing the show. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=79.9s)]
*  Joining once again are two veteran federal prosecutors. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=83.38s)]
*  Thank you for sticking with me, Mary and Shantz. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  So I want to start just with how firm this March 4th date is. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=87.64s)]
*  As people are surking on their calendar, Trump has said he wants to appeal that date. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=91.78s)]
*  He can't do that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=96.2s)]
*  Could it still change? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=97.88s)]
*  It could still change. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=99.88s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't just the trial date that Judge Chutkin set. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=100.88s)]
*  She set all kinds of interim dates, the dates for pretrial motions, the dates for the government [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=104.2s)]
*  to turn over its witness list, the dates for it to turn over its exhibits. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=108.52s)]
*  So there's a whole bunch of interim dates on the schedule. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=112.56s)]
*  There could be legitimate reasons, either on behalf of Mr. Trump or the government, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=116.0s)]
*  for one or two of those dates to slip by a day or two of factual or legal reasons that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=122.04s)]
*  bring them into court to ask for it to slip. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=127.12s)]
*  There could be reasons for that date of March 4th to slip by a day or two or even a week [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=129.08s)]
*  or two. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=133.2s)]
*  But it's not going to slip to pass the election. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=134.2s)]
*  This is going to happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=136.84s)]
*  It's going to happen before the election. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=137.96s)]
*  I think it's going to happen before the convention. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=139.28s)]
*  But people shouldn't be alarmed if something happens and there's a day here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=142.8s)]
*  If it's March 7th or 8th, it's OK. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=147.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  So, Shannon, one of the references is he can't actually appeal the date, but he can delay [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=155.96s)]
*  His lawyers can through pretrial motions, and Mary was referencing these. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=156.96s)]
*  What do some of those look like? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  What are some of the examples of what they could try to do? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think he will have some issues with genuine scheduling issues. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  For example, they might have conflicting other appearance dates in the other cases. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  He might actually be scheduled for a campaign appearance, which is not going to give him [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=171.08s)]
*  a magic bullet for it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, let me just stop you there for just a second. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=176.28s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt you, but if he has a campaign rally, is that a good enough reason to delay [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  a trial? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  Probably not, but it could delay things leading up to the trial. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=184.08s)]
*  And that's the key for him is to try and make some of those deadlines get delayed so that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  it might cause the actual trial date to move a bit. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=193.0s)]
*  All else failing, it might be a good time for him to pull a muscle suddenly so he can't [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=196.44s)]
*  get there that day. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  Pull a muscle or schedule a lot of rallies. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=201.76s)]
*  So whenever the date starts, how long should we expect? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=203.2s)]
*  You don't know the exact amount, but what's the scope of the amount of time that this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=207.2s)]
*  kind of a trial could take? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=210.32s)]
*  I think the government has said four to six weeks, and that's because they've taken a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=211.72s)]
*  look at what witnesses they expect to call, what exhibits they expect to introduce. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=217.56s)]
*  They've made an estimate about cross-examination time for each one of those witnesses. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=222.04s)]
*  But even that is an estimate based on the state of affairs now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=226.04s)]
*  There could be more people cooperating by then. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=230.68s)]
*  There could be some legal rulings that change what evidence is admissible and what is not. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  So there's all kinds of things that could affect that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=237.96s)]
*  But I do think we're looking at at least probably a month-long trial. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=240.36s)]
*  And if we count, also jury selection is going to take time, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=243.8s)]
*  They're going to have to have questionnaires to make sure people can be fair and unbiased [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=247.56s)]
*  and haven't prejudged the case. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=251.12s)]
*  That can take a while in a case like this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  And that could make it take a little bit longer. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=256.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  They already have done those jury questionnaires before March 4th, and they're hoping to actually [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=259.12s)]
*  swear the jury on March 4th. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=263.52s)]
*  But if they have a hard time getting enough people, you know, that could push off a little bit. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  I would disagree with Shand though that the judge is going to give him a pass for things [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  like campaign rallies. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=276.52s)]
*  I think she was pretty clear today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=277.76s)]
*  That seems like it's a bit of a give. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  I think she was pretty clear today. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=281.32s)]
*  People have jobs, and when you're a criminal defendant, you know. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=282.94s)]
*  That's part of your job. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=285.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=286.84s)]
*  He might miss a plane. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  He might miss a plane. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Don't give him ideas. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so also Shand today... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  He has his own plane. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  He does. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  He can't really miss it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Judge Chuckin says she's, quote, watching carefully for anything that might affect or [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=295.84s)]
*  poison the jury pool. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=299.84s)]
*  This really stuck out to me today. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  She says that if Laura intends to poll D.C. residents as part of a change of venue motion, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  he must inform the court. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=307.7s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=309.44s)]
*  And kind of what might she do? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=310.62s)]
*  What does she mean by that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=312.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's really the big looming question here is how do you interpret all the stuff [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=313.56s)]
*  he says as trying to poison the jury pool? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=319.28s)]
*  And there's a very... [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=323.08s)]
*  In a normal case, all of it would be tainting the jury pool. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=324.08s)]
*  And here she's trying to fairly balance the idea of you got to let him campaign. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=327.64s)]
*  He has a right to say, you know, I'm innocent, et cetera. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=331.48s)]
*  If he keeps going really over the line with that, DOJ will be forced to bring that to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=335.44s)]
*  the judge's attention. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=341.36s)]
*  The judge will have to rule on it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=343.24s)]
*  I don't think she'll be shy about ruling on that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=344.24s)]
*  I'm sure she'll give him a couple of passes with stern warnings. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=346.24s)]
*  But I don't think that DOJ is very chomping at the bit to want to bring that because they're [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  so worried about being hit on the First Amendment concerns. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=354.36s)]
*  They're also worried it'll look like it's political persecution, which is what he's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=357.56s)]
*  running on right now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  So Judge Chuckin, I mean, many people described her as not messing around. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=363.04s)]
*  There's lots of ways to describe her. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=367.12s)]
*  But watching the ruling this morning and how she's behaved to date, what is your take? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=368.44s)]
*  What do you read from it and how she's going to operate this trial? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=373.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, she is committed to treating him like any other criminal defendant. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=375.52s)]
*  Now, he's already not being treated exactly like any other criminal defendant, but she [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=379.52s)]
*  wants to do so as much as possible. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=383.72s)]
*  And I think what she did today, like Judge Chuckin was a criminal defense attorney. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=385.68s)]
*  She has defended cases and prepared for trial herself many, many times in her careers, never [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=391.52s)]
*  defending somebody like Mr. Trump, but, you know, defending complicated criminal cases. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=397.04s)]
*  So she's able to really assess how long will it take in a case like this to get ready? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=402.28s)]
*  And I think she's bringing all of her experience both as a criminal defense attorney and as [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=406.92s)]
*  a judge to bring here and try to give him, well, not try, she will give him a fair trial, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=412.1s)]
*  try to respect his rights to due process, but not let him run the show. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=418.02s)]
*  The campaign messages from Republican candidates for president in 2024 are pretty full of darkness, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=423.88s)]
*  division and a big sense of foreboding about the future of the country. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=429.36s)]
*  That stands in stark contrast to what we've been hearing from President Biden's campaign [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=433.56s)]
*  for reelection. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=437.12s)]
*  They made that point with a huge, that's huge for this period of time, $25 million add by [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=438.12s)]
*  the week of the Republican debate to send a different message, including about how the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=443.04s)]
*  United States has come back since the pandemic. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=446.92s)]
*  In small towns and big cities, we're coming back stronger than ever. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=451.12s)]
*  Manufacturing jobs are coming home. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=455.2s)]
*  High speed computer chips are getting made right here. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=457.64s)]
*  America is leading the world in clean energy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  There are some who say America is failing, not Joe Biden. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=463.92s)]
*  He believes our best days are ahead because he believes in the American people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=467.72s)]
*  Those who bet against America are learning how wrong they are. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=473.0s)]
*  It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=476.44s)]
*  Never. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=479.48s)]
*  Julie Chavez Rodriguez is the campaign manager for President Biden's reelection campaign. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=481.92s)]
*  Previously, she was a senior advisor to President Biden and was also a special assistant to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=486.08s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=490.6s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=491.6s)]
*  First of all, I'm so grateful you are here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=493.32s)]
*  You are running a campaign, which by the way is a very busy job and you're moving to Delaware. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=494.8s)]
*  So thank you for being here with me tonight. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=498.48s)]
*  So I wanted to start just with some of the news we learned today. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=501.26s)]
*  And you're a very savvy political operator. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=505.04s)]
*  Obviously you're running a campaign. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=506.48s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction to the prospect of a criminal trial starting on the day before [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=508.24s)]
*  Super Tuesday. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=514.08s)]
*  Well, look, Jen, thank you one for so much for having me this evening. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=515.08s)]
*  And it's just, you know, I think we've seen such incredible support. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=519.04s)]
*  And, you know, I definitely understand that those are matters that will continue to play [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=522.2s)]
*  out in the courts and obviously, you know, for their campaigns that contend with. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=526.36s)]
*  But what we're really focused on is just making sure that the American people really know [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=530.48s)]
*  what President Biden has done, what Vice President Biden has done to be able to support [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  the American voter, what they're doing to lower drug prices, to lower costs for families [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=541.44s)]
*  and to make sure, as you saw in the ad that you just showed, that, you know, we're really [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  reminding folks that America is back and that this president and vice president have made [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=551.0s)]
*  a tremendous investment, not just in the country, but in our people. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=555.76s)]
*  I know you were probably watching the Republican debate last week, even as you're, of course, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  talking about and portraying to the American people all the things President Biden has [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=565.84s)]
*  done. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  What stuck out to you from that debate as you were watching it? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  What was a moment that stuck out to you? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, I think for me, it was really seeing that it was a consistent sort of race [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=575.2s)]
*  to a real extreme agenda. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=580.56s)]
*  What we saw on stage were was maybe not necessarily certain candidates, but definitely their agenda [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=582.52s)]
*  and their policies were front and center. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=587.76s)]
*  And it was a real extreme conversation about, you know, banning abortion and having a national [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=589.88s)]
*  ban on abortion, being able to, you know, take different approaches to, you know, addressing [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=595.36s)]
*  such critical issues. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=601.6s)]
*  It wasn't about real solutions for the American people. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's what we're really focused on, is making sure that we're communicating that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=606.44s)]
*  contrast. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=610.2s)]
*  And what we saw on the debate stage, again, was a real race towards this extreme agenda [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=611.2s)]
*  that we've continued to see from so many of the GOP primary candidates right now. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=616.28s)]
*  And it's out of touch with the American voter. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=622.64s)]
*  It's so extreme. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=625.4s)]
*  And we know that, you know, that's something that's not a real winning agenda or a, you [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=626.72s)]
*  know, winning sort of campaign. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=632.24s)]
*  Well, I know you guys did an ad on abortion after the debate last week. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=633.76s)]
*  And it's always telling where campaigns spend money, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=639.0799999999999s)]
*  Because it's where it sticks out in your mind and where you think you can have the biggest [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=641.24s)]
*  impact. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=644.6s)]
*  How do you combat this argument, which also drives me insane, that many of these Republican [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=645.6s)]
*  candidates are making, that Democratic candidates want to, they support more abortions in a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=650.16s)]
*  third trimester. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=656.7199999999999s)]
*  They support abortion till 40 weeks, till birth. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  It's just not accurate. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=660.88s)]
*  And I think, you know, what do you wish people, what do you wish people were saying out there? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=661.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I wish that people really understood that, you know, the president and the vice [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=665.8s)]
*  president are focused on restoring fundamental freedoms for the American people. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=670.48s)]
*  the Dobbs decision was, I think, a real eye opener for so many women across this country, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=675.28s)]
*  for so many families across this country, where all of a sudden, you know, today in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=681.04s)]
*  America, you know, my younger niece has less rights than I do. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=685.04s)]
*  And that's what, you know, people are really starting to see and understand about how just [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=688.64s)]
*  extreme their agenda is. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=694.28s)]
*  And what the president and vice president are focused on is restoring Roe v. Wade and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=696.06s)]
*  ensuring that that becomes the law of the land, because that's an important, you know, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=699.78s)]
*  that's an important sort of right that we have fought for and we need to continue to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=705.14s)]
*  fight for. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=709.5s)]
*  One of the moments that stood out to me in that debate was when the majority of candidates [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=710.86s)]
*  raised their hand and said they would support Donald Trump, even if he was convicted of [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  a crime. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=720.98s)]
*  Now, I know you're focused on a positive proactive agenda that the president is implementing, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=721.98s)]
*  which is hugely important, what impacts the American public. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=727.18s)]
*  But what was going through your head in that moment? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=729.9s)]
*  Well, you know, I think it just shows that all of them are really, you know, trying to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=731.5s)]
*  take the more extreme position and really trying to sort of take that race for the MAGA [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=735.7399999999999s)]
*  base and take, again, sort of just extreme positions that are out of touch with voters. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=741.42s)]
*  I mean, by saying that climate change is a hoax is one example. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=746.0999999999999s)]
*  It's just absolutely out of touch with the reality that we're facing as a nation and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  that we're facing as a world. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=756.38s)]
*  So I think, you know, we want to continue to just make sure that we are really showing [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=758.42s)]
*  how extreme those positions are and that they're all sort of coming from the same kind of policy [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=763.1s)]
*  agenda that we saw continue to lose in election after election. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=770.14s)]
*  I think one thing for us that's really exciting, in addition to seeing the kind of enthusiasm [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=774.66s)]
*  for our campaign, is knowing that in the last 38 special elections, Democrats have outperformed [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=779.1s)]
*  by 10 percent. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=785.5s)]
*  And that's something that we're going to continue to grow and continue to build on. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=786.46s)]
*  That's an important statistic. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=789.74s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people know. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=791.26s)]
*  Now, there are a lot of backseat drivers when it comes to running political campaigns. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=792.94s)]
*  I don't have to tell you, you're probably living that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=798.3000000000001s)]
*  I know that from working in the White House. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=800.0600000000001s)]
*  And what do you say to Democrats who say the president and the campaign, they should all [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=802.14s)]
*  be talking about Trump's legal issues and these criminal indictments much more. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=807.6600000000001s)]
*  And it's a missed opportunity. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=811.34s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the president, when he ran for office in the first place, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=813.1s)]
*  was really adamant about ensuring that the Justice Department was an independent [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=817.34s)]
*  department and that they were able to execute effectively in the ways that they needed to. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=824.22s)]
*  And so, you know, we're going to continue to ensure that the Justice Department has [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=829.4200000000001s)]
*  the ability to do their job. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=835.02s)]
*  And what we're going to continue to focus on is just, again, the accomplishments that [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=836.5400000000001s)]
*  this president and vice president have achieved, thanks to, again, incredible legislation that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=841.74s)]
*  we've been able to pass, but also the choice that's before voters right now and really [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=846.14s)]
*  what's at stake in this election. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=850.62s)]
*  And, you know, when we're dealing with a Republican field that is scapegoating immigrants, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=852.38s)]
*  that's talking about banning books, that again continues to focus on a national abortion ban, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=857.42s)]
*  we just know that those are out of touch with so many voters across this country. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=861.98s)]
*  So every campaign looks different because they're happening in different moments in time [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=866.46s)]
*  and you're trying to win to state the obvious. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=870.46s)]
*  What should people expect about how this campaign will be different from President Biden's [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=872.94s)]
*  election campaign back in 2020? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=878.22s)]
*  Well, we're really excited to be able to be headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=880.62s)]
*  As, you know, many folks know, it just it really is a home for President Biden. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=884.86s)]
*  That's where he's raised his family. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsiULXxOaqY&t=890.14s)]
