# RFK Jr.'s CDC plans study on long-debunked link between vaccines and autism
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw)
*  There are now measles outbreaks in at least 12 states as cases jump by a third week over week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=0.0s)]
*  Last year there were only 285 documented cases of measles in the whole United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=6.0s)]
*  This year it's only March and there are already 246 cases. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=11.0s)]
*  Disease killed a six-year-old in Texas last week, the first death from measles in the U.S. in a decade. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=16.0s)]
*  And then this week an infected adult died in New Mexico. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=22.0s)]
*  Both were unvaccinated. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=26.0s)]
*  Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=28.0s)]
*  We have a vaccine that is 97% effective in preventing it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=31.0s)]
*  But we also have a secretary of health and human services who says the decision to vaccinate is a personal one, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=35.0s)]
*  while touting vitamins and steroids and ambulance rides instead. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=40.0s)]
*  Right now we have, we're delivering vitamin A. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=45.0s)]
*  We are providing assistance if people need ambulance rides. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=50.0s)]
*  And they're getting very, very good results. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=55.0s)]
*  They report from butasinide, which is a steroid that's a 30-year-old steroid, and clarithromycin, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=58.0s)]
*  and also cod liver oil, which has high concentrations of vitamin A and vitamin D. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=72.0s)]
*  Dr. Peter Hotez, the co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=82.0s)]
*  is also dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=86.0s)]
*  and author of The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science, a Scientist's Warning. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=90.0s)]
*  He spoke at a press conference on the measles outbreak in Texas just this week, and he joins me now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=93.0s)]
*  Doctor, I'm trying to not be, I'm trying to be open-minded or at least charitable, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=99.0s)]
*  but it seems strange to me that the secretary of health and human services in the midst of a deadly measles outbreak [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=105.0s)]
*  has not on camera urged people to get vaccinated once, so far as I can tell. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=110.0s)]
*  And he actually wrote an opinion piece for the Fox News website where he started talking about the vaccine, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=115.0s)]
*  but then he didn't talk about its effectiveness and why it's safe, instead pivoted to everything else, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=123.0s)]
*  including some of the things that he mentioned and what you just played. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=130.0s)]
*  The point is that, Chris, this is a very dangerous measles epidemic here in West Texas and now moving into New Mexico. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=134.0s)]
*  The official numbers are close to 200, but the actual numbers, according to people on the ground, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=142.0s)]
*  suggest there could be much higher. There could be several hundred cases right now and more than 20 hospitalizations, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=147.0s)]
*  two deaths already. And you know what? This is still accelerating, Chris. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=155.0s)]
*  This is, we're still, we still may not have peaked and may still be in the early stages. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=158.0s)]
*  So it is the only thing we can really do to slow this epidemic right now is to encourage people to get their MMR vaccine, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=163.0s)]
*  one of the safest, most effective vaccines that we have. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=172.0s)]
*  And he seems to be talking about everything else but the vaccination. It just makes no sense. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=175.0s)]
*  Fortunately, we have a very good state health department here in Texas, great local county health departments, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=181.0s)]
*  and they're doing the hard work to make that happen. But it's the secretary is not helping at this point. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=187.0s)]
*  Let me ask you a question, informational question. So Gaines County, which is the place where the where the I think the outbreak started, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=194.0s)]
*  as far as we can tell, or at most intense, has one of the highest vaccine opt out rates in the state. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=202.0s)]
*  It's nearly 18 percent vaccine exemptions that puts you at 82 percent far from the herd immunity you need at sort of 95 in the midst of an outbreak. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=209.0s)]
*  If people haven't vaccinated, does it help to go get vaccinated like tomorrow? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=218.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. In fact, Chris, not only that, even if you've been exposed to measles, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=224.0s)]
*  if you get vaccinated within 72 hours after exposure, it will have mitigating effects to either prevent you from getting sick or or or reduce the severity of illness. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=231.0s)]
*  It's called post exposure prophylaxis. And that's what we're pushing for because there is a lot of measles exposure going on and it's never too late to get vaccinated. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=243.0s)]
*  So it's all hands on deck. I know I sound like a broken record, but that's it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=251.0s)]
*  Vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate right now in order to say literally save lives since we've already had two deaths. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=255.0s)]
*  Let me just show the 19 this chart that shows sort of what our trajectory of measles have been. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=262.0s)]
*  Nineteen sixty three when the vaccine was licensed, the second dose is recommended in 1989 there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=266.0s)]
*  And then you see elimination declared in 2000. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=272.0s)]
*  You know, not so limited right now, but but I mean, that's what the vaccines that's what the vaccines did. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=277.0s)]
*  The the CDC has also announced it again. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=284.0s)]
*  I have to imagine this is coming directly from the top from our of K that they plan to study vaccines and autism. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=288.0s)]
*  This is a a much debunked link. There was quite notoriously a Lancet study published several decades ago that was subsequently retracted. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=297.0s)]
*  It did a tremendous amount of harm. This is actually something you have spent a lot of time on and even wrote a book about. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=306.0s)]
*  Vaccines did not cause Rachel's autism. My journey is a vaccine. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=312.0s)]
*  Tynatus pediatrician, autism and autism dad as someone who has specific expertise here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=315.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to the CDC announcement? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=321.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I wrote that book after for a year having long conversations with Robert F. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=324.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. in 2017 at the request of the National Institutes of Health. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=328.0s)]
*  And what it does is it details the strong evidence, two decades of evidence showing there's absolutely no link between vaccines and autism. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=332.0s)]
*  And the goalposts keep moving. At first it was the MMR vaccine. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=341.0s)]
*  They said then R.F.K. Jr. wrote an article in Rolling Stone magazine saying it was the thimerosal preservative that used to be in vaccine. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=344.0s)]
*  Then it was HP. Then it was the HPV vaccine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=351.0s)]
*  And then it was spacing vaccines too close together. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=354.0s)]
*  Alam and vaccine each time the scientific communities debunked it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=357.0s)]
*  But the other point, Chris, and this is probably the most important point, is the lack of plausibility. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=360.0s)]
*  Autism begins with fetal brain development in the first and second trimester of pregnancy well before kids ever see vaccines. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=366.0s)]
*  We have detailed knowledge of this. We have 100 autism genes that have been identified. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=373.0s)]
*  We even sequenced my daughter's, Rachel's, autism gene, along with my wife and I, Ann and I, in order to find her autism gene. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=378.0s)]
*  So it's a lack of plausibility. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=386.0s)]
*  Interestingly, it doesn't mean there can't be any environmental influence, but if it is, it's around the time of conception in the first trimester of pregnancy interacting with autism genes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=389.0s)]
*  So for instance, one of the things I remember talking to R.F.K. Jr. about back in 2017 is if you're pregnant but are not aware of it and you're taking an anti-seizure medication called Depakote, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=398.0s)]
*  also known as Valproic Acid, it's a very common medication. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=407.0s)]
*  Your child has a higher likelihood of being born with an autism type phenotype because it's interacting with the genes early on in pregnancy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=410.0s)]
*  And there are other chemicals that can do that as well. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=417.0s)]
*  I said, Bobby, you're an environmental attorney. This is what you should be all over this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=420.0s)]
*  And I really couldn't engage him. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=425.0s)]
*  So there is a need to have a good relationship with the genes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=427.0s)]
*  So there is a need to understand more about autism and understand environmental influences associated with pregnancy, nothing to do with vaccines. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=432.0s)]
*  So there is a need to have a good relationship with the genes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=439.0s)]
*  So there is a need to have a good relationship with the genes. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=442.0s)]
*  So there is a need to have a good relationship with the genes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=445.0s)]
*  So there is a need to have a good relationship with the genes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=448.0s)]
*  So there is a need to have a good relationship with the genes. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v_bcljRrw&t=462.0s)]
