# Trump doesn’t get his ‘Legally Blonde’ moment, storms out of court
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8)
*  Today, for the first time, Donald Trump took the stand in one of his many trials. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=0.0s)]
*  Not the two federal trials, not the George Racketeering trial, not the hush money trial, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  the civil fraud trial underway in Manhattan right now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=8.88s)]
*  Trump's been attending every day, doesn't apparently have anything better to do, and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=12.0s)]
*  he was summoned to the witness stand by the judge himself to answer for a potential violation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=14.96s)]
*  of a gag order the judge imposed three weeks ago. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=21.92s)]
*  That gag order came after Trump posted a photo to social media of the court's clerk attacking [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=25.42s)]
*  her. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  And the gag order banned Trump from, reasonably, I'd say, quote, posting or speaking publicly [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=32.900000000000006s)]
*  about the judge's staff. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=37.94s)]
*  Well, this morning, Trump went to the cameras outside the courtroom and he said this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=39.34s)]
*  We had a jury. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=44.78s)]
*  It would have been fair, at least, even if it was a somewhat negative jury, because no [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=45.78s)]
*  negative jury would vote against me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  But this judge will, because this judge is a very partisan judge, with a person who's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=52.42s)]
*  very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=57.86s)]
*  So he said, the judge, the judges with a partisan person sitting alongside him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=63.42s)]
*  The judge took issue with that comment, summoned Trump to the witness stand to answer for it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=68.9s)]
*  He asked him, quote, to whom were you referring when you said the person sitting alongside [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  of him? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  You and Cohn, Trump said. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=79.06s)]
*  The judge asked, are you sure you didn't mean the person on the other side of me, my principal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=80.5s)]
*  law clerk? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=85.14s)]
*  Yes, I am sure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=86.14s)]
*  Later, the judge asked Trump, quote, don't you always refer to Michael Cohn as Michael [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=87.14s)]
*  Cohn? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=91.5s)]
*  No, Trump said. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=92.5s)]
*  His attorneys jumped in to help him out, with Chris Kyes insisting, many things even worse [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=93.86s)]
*  than that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=97.7s)]
*  Alina Haba adding, quote, yes, your honor, I can confirm that, much worse. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=98.7s)]
*  The judge then made his decision. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=102.54s)]
*  And I quote the judge here, as the trier of fact, I find the witness is not credible that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=104.22s)]
*  he was referring to my law clerk, who is principal law clerk, who is sitting much closer to me, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=110.42s)]
*  who doesn't have a barrier, whom I believe has been accused by the defendant of being [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=115.8s)]
*  partisan or Democrat or partisan Democrat. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  I hereby fine you $10,000, which is on the low side, to be paid within 30 days to the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=122.66s)]
*  lawyer's fund for client protection. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=128.06s)]
*  Now, about 45 minutes after that, the judge denied a motion by Trump's lawyer. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=130.78s)]
*  And to the apparent surprise of his attorneys, Trump stormed out of the courtroom with Secret [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=134.66s)]
*  Service chasing behind. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=138.9s)]
*  Irate and red-faced, he stopped, only to talk to the scrambling cameras outside the courtroom. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  The witness just admitted that we won the trial, and the judge should end this trial [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=147.18s)]
*  immediately. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  The witness admitted no such thing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=156.94s)]
*  Joining me now are two people who are in the courtroom for that incredible scene in different [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=160.46s)]
*  roles. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=163.3s)]
*  Former federal prosecutor, Donya Perry, who represents Michael Cohen, and MSNBC legal [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=164.3s)]
*  analyst Lisa Rubin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=168.62s)]
*  I feel like in the times that I've reported from court, I have occasionally witnessed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=170.62s)]
*  dramatic scenes, but largely it's actually been pretty boring and rotted, not like television. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  Today was wild. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  Today, as Donya and I were discussing before we came on set with you, it was a little bit [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=185.9s)]
*  like watching Legally Blonde. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=188.94s)]
*  For our viewers who know this movie well, there's a moment at the end of the movie where [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=191.02s)]
*  a witness on the stand breaks down and admits to a crime, and then the judge essentially [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=195.02s)]
*  rules the trial over because Elwood's client is not guilty. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=199.06s)]
*  And that is exactly what Cliff Robert, who represents the Trump sons, expected to happen [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=203.66s)]
*  today. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=208.82s)]
*  He moved for what's called a directed verdict. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=209.82s)]
*  That's asking the judge basically, truncate the trial, end it now, and fine for us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=211.18s)]
*  And he didn't do that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=215.98s)]
*  But that's what they expected to happen. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=216.98s)]
*  And they honestly seemed surprised. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=217.98s)]
*  And Trump seemed just downright angry that that's not what happened. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=219.62s)]
*  It was definitely like television or a film. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=222.98s)]
*  So your client, was he in the room today as well? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=225.86s)]
*  He was. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=228.74s)]
*  He started the day on the stand, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=229.74s)]
*  He was on the stand almost the entire day, other than for the portion of the day where [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=230.74s)]
*  the judge found Mr. Trump not credible. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=234.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=237.06s)]
*  So what happens is Trump comes out and says that thing, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=238.06s)]
*  Which, I don't know, you guys were in the room and sort of caught the vibe. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=242.94000000000003s)]
*  It seems to me obvious he was talking about the judge's clerk who he has a fixation on, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=246.22s)]
*  who the lawyers apparently have a little bit of fixation on. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=250.9s)]
*  Is that a fair reading? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  Do you think there's any context clues he was actually talking about your client, Michael Cohen? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, when he wants to talk about Michael Cohen, he says Michael Cohen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=258.22s)]
*  In fact, he did in a true social post last evening. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=261.74s)]
*  He did in front of the cameras today. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=265.82s)]
*  So he certainly knows how to direct his vitriol in Mr. Cohen's general direction. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=267.72s)]
*  So I certainly think the judge had ample support for his credibility determination. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, without the rest of the quote, it's a little bit arguable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=279.92s)]
*  You could even be generous to Trump and say it's ambiguous. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=283.72s)]
*  But there was a portion of that quote that we didn't have an opportunity to play on air, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=286.44000000000005s)]
*  where he returns to talking about Michael Cohen. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  And that to me makes it even more clear that at the very beginning, he is indeed talking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=293.16s)]
*  about the judge's principal law clerk, because then he changes subjects to talk about Michael Cohen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  And just again, to be clear here, like just you guys putting on your like experience in a courtroom. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=302.36s)]
*  I mean, going after a judge's clerk, posting them on social media when you are a person [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=306.88000000000005s)]
*  who when you draw attention to people, often they will receive, they will have security concerns. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=312.82000000000005s)]
*  So you're posting a picture, being ordered by the judge to take it down, not taking down one of them, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=318.16s)]
*  getting a fine for that, and then coming out and in your veiled and clever way talking about that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=322.0s)]
*  I mean, that's totally out of bounds, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  Totally. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=332.8s)]
*  I'm like, how is this? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=334.8s)]
*  And it just seems like one of these things where from the beginning, this started, this is a guy who's got one mode. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=336.0s)]
*  Test, test, test, test. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  And now we're seeing it in every different venue with Judge Shutkin, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=343.8s)]
*  Judge Shutkin gives him a gag order. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=348.24s)]
*  Then she temporarily lifts the gag order pending an appeal. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=350.44000000000005s)]
*  And he goes on to social and violates. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=355.04s)]
*  He's not violating gag order stayed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=358.12s)]
*  The failing New York Times story leaked by deranged Jack Smith, blah, blah, blah, goes after a guy who might be a witness like exactly go like. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=360.44000000000005s)]
*  Kyle Cheney of Politico said it right this morning. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  He said it was like a checklist of how to violate the gag order. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=370.32s)]
*  You know, Chris, I'd also point out to you, though, that even if the gag order stayed, he still has conditions of release that include not violating any state, federal or local statutes. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=374.88s)]
*  There is a witness tempering statute, 18 USC 1512. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=384.24s)]
*  I encourage our viewers to look it up. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=387.8s)]
*  It's arguable that he violated that even if that federal gag order stayed. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=390.0s)]
*  But you're right. He's trying to test at every front. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=393.36s)]
*  And sometimes he might not even be trying. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=395.92s)]
*  I really do think he has a problem with impulse control and certainly has a problem with listening to his lawyers. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=397.32s)]
*  So I should note in the same way that there's like this colorable claim it was about Michael Cohen in this case, the social post was about the documents case, right, which is not Tonya [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=401.92s)]
*  Shetkin's case. Now, at the same time, all this drama is happening, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=410.68s)]
*  Trump gets pulled up onto the witness stand to testify in his own defense by the judge about whether he's going to find him in violation. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Your client is in the room and he gets a subpoena today. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=420.32s)]
*  Last night. Last night. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=423.6s)]
*  About cross examination in the Manhattan District Attorney's criminal case, Trump's lawyers in that case, and there's some overlap and they were in the courtroom today, issued a subpoena to him. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=424.68s)]
*  And I don't want to get into it because I haven't had time yet to formulate my legal strategy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=437.24s)]
*  But it's certainly subpoena to testify in that case for documents for documents. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=442.88s)]
*  Yeah, documents that, you know, clearly it has the stink of witness intimidation once again, at least to me. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=446.84s)]
*  After all of this, I mean, there's the this judge has tried hard to keep these this trial going right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=456.52s)]
*  And there's been back and forth about the different arguments that are made. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=463.84s)]
*  Where is the trial now in terms of its arc? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  There are about 27 witnesses that the New York attorney general intends to put on. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=471.6s)]
*  I'd have to go back to the list to see where we are. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=476.56s)]
*  I don't think we're halfway through that yet. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=478.88s)]
*  Tomorrow, we're expecting testimony from Sherry Dillon, who is the Morgan Lewis partner, who was principally in charge of Trump's legal tax work. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=481.16s)]
*  She's a person known to us because she was at that infamous press conference with the huge stacks of paper. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=489.12s)]
*  Yes. Yes. See, I say that to someone who's a cable news host. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=493.6s)]
*  Oh, Sherry Dillon. I know that sound. We play that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=496.36s)]
*  But I think we'll be here for a few more weeks. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=499.0s)]
*  And certainly they are trying to delay install at every turn. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=501.16s)]
*  You saw that yesterday they made a huge issue out of a covid outbreak on the attorney general's side, trying to use that to delay trial a day further. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=504.36s)]
*  And yet nobody on the Trump side of the courtroom was wearing a mask, which Judge Angoran noted to them were widely available and they were free to wear. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=511.72s)]
*  No one's more, you know, covid neurotic Donald, Donald J. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=519.08s)]
*  Trump, Dona Perry, Lisa Rubin. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=523.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpkgZlp0K8&t=526.28s)]
