# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY)
*  For the first time in over 100 years, the U.S. is a Marine Corps commandant. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=0.0s)]
*  And that is because of one senator who represents roughly 1.5 percent of the American population, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=5.0s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who is also on the Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=10.36s)]
*  You have probably been hearing a lot about Senator Tuberville lately for insisting that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=14.64s)]
*  white nationalists are just American. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=19.2s)]
*  Tuberville has also been holding up hundreds of top military promotions because he wants [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=21.84s)]
*  to impose forced birth on every American service member and their families. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=26.44s)]
*  Now, to be clear, abortion procedures are not covered by the Department of Defense unless [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  the mother's life is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  But after the Dobbs ruling last year, the Pentagon issued a new policy granting leave [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=41.0s)]
*  and covering travel expenses for service members in states where abortion is illegal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=45.64s)]
*  And that is not a small number. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  About 40 percent of all women in active duty or DOD civilian jobs now have limited or [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=54.52s)]
*  no access to abortions, a RAND study shows. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Congresswoman Mickey Sherrill, a former Navy pilot, noted this today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=62.88s)]
*  To do this because he wants to impose, Tuberville wants to impose his own, extremist views on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=68.44s)]
*  service women and military families is really unconscionable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=77.2s)]
*  Right now we have women serving across the country who have no access to quality reproductive [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=81.04s)]
*  health services. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=87.04s)]
*  We are now talking about women who are not just service women, but the families of service [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  members who are stationed in places like Texas, which has about 120,000 active duty service [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=94.2s)]
*  members. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Imagine that you have a high risk pregnancy in Texas right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Senator Tuberville is determined to grind the American defense apparatus to a halt so [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  he can force those women to carry pregnancies to term against their will. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=109.48s)]
*  Doug Jones, the former Democratic Senator of Alabama who preceded Tuberville, now distinguished [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=114.64s)]
*  senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and he joins me now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=119.04s)]
*  Well I guess my first question is, what do you think of what Mr. Tuberville is doing, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  the Senator is doing, and do you think it plays well in the state that you represented [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=127.84s)]
*  of Alabama? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=132.76s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure which thing you're talking about. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=133.76s)]
*  Are you talking about his white nationalist views? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  Are you talking about his military nominations? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=138.76s)]
*  Or what are we talking about? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  There are so many things that I think that he is doing that, quite frankly, Chris, is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  just embarrassing to the state. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=147.28s)]
*  Even though there are so many people that might say they support it, I don't think they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=149.48s)]
*  really fully appreciate, especially on the nominations process, what he's doing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=152.66s)]
*  We've got a state that is a strong military presence, strong veteran presence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=158.76s)]
*  They understand the need to have these generals promoted to have them go up the chain, how [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  important that is to morale. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=168.12s)]
*  That's incredibly important. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=170.6s)]
*  And the thing involving the abortion policy, Chris, it's not really completely a new policy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  in the sense that the Department of Defense has paid for people to go out of state, out [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=178.2s)]
*  of area, if it was needed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  That's a policy that's been in effect because we've got to support our military. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  We've got to support folks. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=191.54s)]
*  So this is nothing really new. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=192.94s)]
*  I really think that this is an attack, again, on women. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=194.84s)]
*  I don't think it likes them in the service, doesn't want them in the service. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=199.0s)]
*  And he's doing what he can to drive them out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=202.32s)]
*  You mentioned, of course, before the controversy that the senator has engaged in about appearing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  to defy, it's unclear, does he not know what white nationalism is? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=211.2s)]
*  He seems to be skeptical of any efforts by the Department of Defense to find and block [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=215.52s)]
*  from joining the service, outright white nationalists, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=222.46s)]
*  And he doesn't like that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  He thinks that it's unclear what he understands about this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=228.06s)]
*  This is him talking to our own Ryan Nobles, giving his sort of latest version of this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=230.66s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  I wonder if you could kind of clarify for us what you meant on CNN about white nationalism [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  and generally your thoughts on it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=244.46s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I'm totally against any racism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  And I'm told that white nationalism, they consider racism. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=248.46s)]
*  I'm totally against that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=252.78s)]
*  What is he doing here? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=255.78s)]
*  Is he playing like he doesn't understand or does he not understand? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  I think he is bending to pressure from his colleagues that finally said enough is enough, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  Senator. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=267.62s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=268.62s)]
*  This is wrong to be in the military. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=269.62s)]
*  White nationalism is pure racism. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=272.14s)]
*  It's racism in its rawest form. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=274.54s)]
*  Nobody knows that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=278.34s)]
*  It was just stunning to me that he said, I'm told that it was white racism. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=279.34s)]
*  He told CNN the other night, well, it was just her opinion it was white race, that it [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  was racism. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=289.34s)]
*  It is very difficult with him when he says these things, which, by the way, was not his [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=290.34s)]
*  first rodeo on talking about white nationalism and including some other racist comments. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=295.58s)]
*  This is not the first time that has happened. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=302.4s)]
*  So I think he's bending to some pressure. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=304.7s)]
*  It's clear that he really didn't believe it or want to say it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=307.7s)]
*  At least that's the impression you get with watching and listening to him, that he was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=311.82s)]
*  begrudgingly trying to clarify for his colleagues' sake, not his. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good and important point. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=323.3s)]
*  Every bite at the apple, he keeps doing the same thing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=327.06s)]
*  Well, you say it's this, and if they say that, then I guess. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=329.02s)]
*  But it's like you could, I mean, you're a U.S. senator. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=331.62s)]
*  You can go read a few books, spend a few hours trying to figure out what the term means, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=334.7s)]
*  Google it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=338.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=339.94s)]
*  But this thing of like, well, they keep telling me. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=340.94s)]
*  More importantly, he's from Alabama. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=343.3s)]
*  He should know things like this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=347.9s)]
*  Remember, this is a guy who, as a candidate, did not know what the Voting Rights Act was. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=350.3s)]
*  I keep coming back to that because that was the first telltale sign about where he actually [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=355.9s)]
*  stands on things when you don't even know what it is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=362.44s)]
*  And he didn't. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=365.2s)]
*  It was clear that he didn't know that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=366.2s)]
*  So a senator from Alabama ought to know our history, ought to know where we are, ought [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  to be on the right side of history and not the wrong side. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=372.76s)]
*  And he has clearly consistently been on the wrong side of history on this issue as well [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  as the military issue. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=381.67999999999995s)]
*  Doug Jones, who served as senator from Alabama, thank you very much. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=384.67999999999995s)]
*  Over the next few months in Florida, around 100,000 homeowners will find that their homeowners' [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=390.52s)]
*  insurance is ending in the middle of hurricane season. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=394.76s)]
*  That is because farmers' insurance is now the fourth major home insurer to leave the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=398.08s)]
*  state. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=403.12s)]
*  It's pretty clear why. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=404.12s)]
*  Florida, of course, has always been subject to lots of extreme weather, but things have [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=405.12s)]
*  gotten much worse as climate change ramps up. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=408.44s)]
*  For instance, take a look right now at the ocean temperatures around Florida on Monday. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=411.64s)]
*  Florida's in white there. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=417.0s)]
*  That's the ocean around it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=418.0s)]
*  That is 90 degrees or higher water temperature. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=419.32s)]
*  90 degrees. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=422.32s)]
*  That's bathtub, hot tub, border, nearly unheard of. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=424.12s)]
*  And this is crucial because the warmth of the ocean is the energy that powers hurricanes. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=428.44s)]
*  So farmers is just doing the math. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=434.84s)]
*  The administration of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has no actual response to this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=437.64s)]
*  pressing issue. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=441.4s)]
*  And so what they've decided to do is, wait for it, attack farmers' insurance for being [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=442.4s)]
*  too woke. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=447.36s)]
*  The state chief financial officer released a statement saying, quote, I sincerely believe [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=448.84s)]
*  that today's actions, farmers' insurance is well on its way to becoming the bud light [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=454.44s)]
*  of insurance. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  But no amount of culture war is going to solve the basic problem here. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=460.2s)]
*  Insurers are fleeing the market and insurance premiums are shooting up. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=465.44s)]
*  Ben Keyes is an economist and a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=469.28s)]
*  Wharton School of Business. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  He's been studying the cost of the climate crisis for years, particularly insurance, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=473.84s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  Ben, you've given testimony before the Senate on this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=478.64s)]
*  You wrote a New York Times op-ed on this. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=481.48s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=484.8s)]
*  This, farmers is not the first, but why are they leaving? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=485.8s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Chris. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=489.72s)]
*  This is not about wokeness. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=492.2s)]
*  It's about the weather. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=494.2s)]
*  Storms have gotten more severe, more frequent. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  We've already had 12 storms this year across the country, or 12 disasters that have been [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=498.88s)]
*  more than a billion dollars in verified damages. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=503.68s)]
*  So that's factor number one. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=506.32s)]
*  Factor number two is that the costs of rebuilding have gone up faster than inflation. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=508.64s)]
*  The cost of materials is very high and the cost of labor in our tight labor market is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=513.9599999999999s)]
*  also very high. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=518.12s)]
*  And the third is maybe the least woke aspect, which is the reinsurance market. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=519.64s)]
*  And this is how insurers protect themselves on the back end. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=523.52s)]
*  And the reinsurers have said, we see the models, we see the data, and we're not willing to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  ensure these portfolios in the ways that we were in the past. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=532.16s)]
*  And so those three factors are driving insurers to raise premiums, cut coverage, or leave [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=535.16s)]
*  the state entirely. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=540.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=541.56s)]
*  So on that last thing, and just to do a little insurance 101, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=542.56s)]
*  So you're running an insurance company, you're taking premiums from people, they're taking [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=545.4s)]
*  little payments as a hedge against catastrophic risk, right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=548.6s)]
*  So you're taking in that money, then you got to do something with that money, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  And when a storm hits, right, all of a sudden you've got lots of claims, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=556.24s)]
*  You got to pay that out. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=559.72s)]
*  And so what the insurers do is they have their own insurers as a way of hedging their own [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=560.8s)]
*  risk that are like reinsurance companies. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=566.0s)]
*  And those companies, I understand, have been sort of at the forefront of thinking about [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=568.8399999999999s)]
*  climate models, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=572.88s)]
*  Yeah, they have a lot of money at stake. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  This is their business, is protecting themselves from these types of disasters and pooling [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=577.56s)]
*  risk and spreading it as widely as possible. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=583.24s)]
*  And so when the alarms go off for the reinsurers, that's when they pass on the changing costs [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=586.5s)]
*  to the insurers, and the insurers then pass it on to the homeowners directly. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=591.66s)]
*  You write that even with higher premiums, unpredictable losses are wreaking havoc on [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=597.22s)]
*  the bottom lines of insurers. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=601.22s)]
*  Ten insurers, ten insurers have gone belly up in Florida in just the last two years. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=602.54s)]
*  And here's the other thing that is notable to me. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=606.06s)]
*  I was talking to someone who was in California and talking about the parts of California. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=607.66s)]
*  It's one thing if your premiums go up, which is terrible, and I think the average, the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=611.94s)]
*  median in Florida is like $6,000 a year in home insurance. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=616.0200000000001s)]
*  But it's a whole other thing if insurers just say, no, it's uninsurable. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=619.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think there are parts of California that are very exposed to wildfire risk where [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=623.5s)]
*  it's just like, it's not a question of what premium you could pay. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=629.0600000000001s)]
*  It's just you can't find insurers. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=631.94s)]
*  Yeah, and the absence of an insurance policy is deeply troubling for that community because [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=634.22s)]
*  without an insurance policy, you're not going to be able to get a mortgage. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=641.86s)]
*  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't issue a mortgage unless you can attach an insurance policy [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=644.78s)]
*  to it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=648.7s)]
*  And without a mortgage, without that kind of financing, housing markets can collapse [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=650.38s)]
*  or seize up in very dramatic ways. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=654.28s)]
*  And so I think what we're going to see more of is more dependency on these state-run insurers [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=657.34s)]
*  of last resort. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=662.82s)]
*  So like Citizens Insurance in Florida, which now has 1.3 million policyholders, is the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=663.9s)]
*  largest insurer in the state. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=669.1s)]
*  And this was set up to be very much a stopgap kind of program. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=671.74s)]
*  And instead, it's taken on a predominant role in the entire market. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=676.66s)]
*  So I think we're going to see much more of a role for the state to play when there are [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=680.34s)]
*  no private insurers willing to bear the risk. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=684.5s)]
*  Well, this is where it's all headed, right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=686.74s)]
*  And this is, again, you've got to be a little skeptical that the insurance companies, I [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  can't quite always take them face value, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=692.58s)]
*  I mean, they want to keep their premiums high and their claims low. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=694.5s)]
*  I think they're also, everyone's looking around for public subsidy, right? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=698.14s)]
*  So what ends up going to be the case, right? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=701.3s)]
*  The free market, up by your bootstraps, big bad government folks, are going to have to, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=704.06s)]
*  in all these places that are very weather exposed, Texas, Florida, and all throughout [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=710.74s)]
*  the Southeast particularly, are basically, it's going to fall to the government, which [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=714.62s)]
*  is the insurer of last resort, right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=718.5s)]
*  And it always is. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=721.8199999999999s)]
*  And so I think when we're thinking about this idea of the free market, the free market is [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=722.8199999999999s)]
*  a very circumscribed, plays a very circumscribed role in the insurance market. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=726.9s)]
*  Insurance markets are very highly regulated. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=730.9s)]
*  And we have a number of programs at state and federal levels that provide a ton of support. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=733.16s)]
*  So the National Flood Insurance Program being the clearest example of an insurance market [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=739.02s)]
*  where private insurers were unwilling to provide the degree of coverage necessary. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=744.3s)]
*  And so we needed to nationalize that market and create an entire national market. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=748.84s)]
*  And you may need to see something similar for wildfires, for instance, going forward [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=752.42s)]
*  or other types of backstops that are going to be more resilient than what any individual [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=757.1s)]
*  state could put together because the uncertainty is whether these state run entities will have [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=762.54s)]
*  the political will to charge people the right price. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=767.42s)]
*  And that's what this partly comes down to is, is the price going to be set to really [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=770.06s)]
*  induce adaptation? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=774.82s)]
*  Are we going to see meaningful behavior change? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=776.14s)]
*  And that happens when people are forced to pay premiums that reflect the risk. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=778.62s)]
*  So that's, I mean, let's just talk about the risk for a second. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=783.38s)]
*  Obviously, I just want to show people again to remember where we are as I speak to you [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=785.6600000000001s)]
*  this summer of 2023. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=789.0200000000001s)]
*  This is daily temperature, summer 2023. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=790.38s)]
*  You'll see that curve there. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=793.5s)]
*  And then there's a line at the top. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=794.5s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=796.14s)]
*  We're sort of off the chart. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=797.14s)]
*  Daily temperature 2023. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=798.96s)]
*  That's us right there at the top. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=800.5400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=802.5400000000001s)]
*  This is sea surface temperature. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=803.5400000000001s)]
*  You can get a sense of what's going on in the water, the sea surface temperature. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=806.0200000000001s)]
*  Again, that's us at the top in red 2023, right off the chart. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=809.98s)]
*  That point about adaptation is the ultimate one, which is it's not good. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=814.38s)]
*  I mean, what's going to happen, what I fear is that we subsidize people living in the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=820.22s)]
*  path of disaster. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=824.14s)]
*  And that's going to be really destructive. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=826.58s)]
*  But that looks like the way we're headed in states like Florida. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=829.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=832.14s)]
*  Well, that's what we've done for decades. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=833.14s)]
*  So through the National Flood Insurance Program, through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=835.5s)]
*  don't price geographic risk of their loans, through many other federal programs, we subsidize [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=839.58s)]
*  living in harm's way. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=846.38s)]
*  And I think the big question that's going to face local, state, and federal policymakers [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=847.86s)]
*  is who's going to bear those risks going forward? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=852.9200000000001s)]
*  Are we going to be willing to continue to subsidize that type of living, or are we going [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=855.4000000000001s)]
*  to make those who are choosing to live in the most exposed areas pay the price? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=860.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=865.5799999999999s)]
*  Ben Keys, who's been a really key resource on this for me. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3j3p1YoGY&t=866.5799999999999s)]
