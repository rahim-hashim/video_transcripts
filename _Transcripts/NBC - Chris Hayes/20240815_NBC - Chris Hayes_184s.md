# Harris campaign hits JD Vance over his ‘weird’ politics
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo)
*  JD Vance is not winning the weirdness issue. Last night, Trump's running mate went on Fox News so [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=0.0s)]
*  Laura Ingraham could do what she could for him. Vance was pitched this softball about how Republicans [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=5.12s)]
*  can better appeal to suburban women, and then it got weird. Senator, one of my dear friends [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=10.48s)]
*  tonight said to me, well, all these suburban women, all these suburban women, all they care [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=16.88s)]
*  about is abortion and they don't understand that decision is with the states now. It's not banned [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=21.52s)]
*  nationally, even if people, some people want it to be banned nationally, it's with the states. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=26.4s)]
*  What do you say to suburban women out there who are marinating in this propaganda? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't buy that, Laura. I think most suburban women care about the normal [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=38.64s)]
*  things that most Americans care about. The normal things. I would argue that most women in this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  country hack most voters that it's perfectly normal to be concerned that some bearded politician [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=47.76s)]
*  is going to tell them what they can and can't do with their bodies. But apparently JD Vance knows [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=52.56s)]
*  better. Even his polls consistently show that abortion rights rank among the most important [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  issues facing Americans. And his ballot initiatives enshrining abortion rights continue to see [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  massive support among voters, even in deep red states. This latest debacle from Vance comes [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=66.64s)]
*  after dozens of other statements that are equally as weird and alienating to normal people. From his [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=72.16s)]
*  disparaging comments about so-called childless cat ladies, to his participation in a weird podcast [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=77.68s)]
*  conversation about quote, post-menopausal women, to his forced folksy fundraising email describing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=83.36000000000001s)]
*  how my mamma never beat around the bush and neither do I. Doesn't help when even Donald [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=90.72000000000001s)]
*  Trump is trying to avoid being associated with you. That's a New York Times report. At a recent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=95.84s)]
*  fundraiser, a donor asked about Democrats trying to paint the Republican ticket as weird. Mr. Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  replied, not about me. They're saying that about JD. Reassuring stuff. And it's not just Donald [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=106.64s)]
*  Trump who's apparently put off by his running mate. Vance's history of being genuinely very strange [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=112.88s)]
*  has shaped the narrative of how the American public perceives him, resulting in polling that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=118.08s)]
*  paints him as historically unpopular for a vice presidential nominee. A new morning consult poll [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=122.48s)]
*  shows that nearly half of those surveyed were dissatisfied with Vance's VP pick with just [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=128.16s)]
*  barely over a third approving of the choice. Those numbers are nearly flipped for Tim Walls [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=133.2s)]
*  and the Democratic ticket, with 43% approving the Walls and only 36% dissatisfied. So it's not going [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=138.16s)]
*  great for JD Vance and things like this don't help. My favorite image of the day. Check out this photo [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=144.56s)]
*  posted by a Republican congressman on the campaign plane with Vance as they head out to try to tell [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  Americans the economy is in shambles when it isn't. The headline on the Wall Street Journal on the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=154.64s)]
*  table says it all. Inflation hits lowest levels since 2021. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE06h_Zxfjo&t=159.28s)]
