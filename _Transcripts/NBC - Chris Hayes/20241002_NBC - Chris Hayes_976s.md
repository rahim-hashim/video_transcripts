# Full Ta-Nehisi Coates interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M)
*  Tana Hasi-Kotz is a New York Times bestselling author and recipient of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=0.0s)]
*  National Book Award among other accolades. His latest book The Message is [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=4.16s)]
*  in bookstore now and he joins me. Good to see you man. Good to be back. Back at it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Yeah well I'm gonna start with this from the book because I think it sets up our [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=14.4s)]
*  conversation and all the conversations people will see you having over the next [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=19.72s)]
*  few weeks. You said the late Jamal Khashoggi, the murdered writer from Saudi [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=22.88s)]
*  Arabia, was fond of the Arabic proverb say your word then leave. I try to live [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=28.04s)]
*  by that because I am at my worst out there defending you say my children [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=32.4s)]
*  with your books defending my books and I'm at my best making more of them. This [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  part of the gig I think is your least favorite. Well being here with you is nice. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=41.24s)]
*  You know the thing I was actually thinking of was this sort of discourse [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=47.84s)]
*  that happens when writers write what they write and then somebody replies and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=52.16s)]
*  the writer decides that they need to clarify. I've engaged in that in the past. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=57.72s)]
*  It's a trap a little bit. Oh yeah I don't think it's really helped me. Well part of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=64.0s)]
*  what makes it hard and part of this book this book as much as anything and someone [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=67.6s)]
*  asked me the other day I was raving about it and they said what's it about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=71.16s)]
*  and I was brought up a little short. Right. It's gonna be both. Well it's as much as [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=73.48s)]
*  anything it's a love letter to writing. Yes it is. It's a love letter to writing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=79.68s)]
*  Yes and part of what comes through is that the work that goes into the clarity [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=83.08s)]
*  of writing is almost impossible to do in any other medium. Yeah and that was like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=88.28s)]
*  a really really important thing for me. I think people forget that you know in an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  era where you know obviously video is so important here but I think people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=98.44s)]
*  really forget that at the base of it you know somebody has to write something [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=104.12s)]
*  down you know and you know when I was teaching at Howard University which so [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=107.56s)]
*  much still am teaching with so much of this book comes out of you know the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=111.44s)]
*  thing I was trying to impress upon my students is even if all you don't go on [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=114.6s)]
*  to be essayist poets fiction writers the process of learning to express yourself [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=118.32s)]
*  with clarity is valuable. It's valuable no matter what you go on to do the things [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=124.28s)]
*  that I try to do you know in the extreme in order to write a book like that is no [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=129.6s)]
*  different than the things I try to do when I'm trying to write a memo or email. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=133.04s)]
*  There are three essays in this book. The one that I think is probably going to get [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=136.84s)]
*  the most attention. Dakar. Yeah exactly. You know most attention and the most [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=142.08s)]
*  controversy and the most discourses about your trip to both Israel and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Palestine to the West Bank and Tel Aviv and other parts of Israel. Just start by [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=154.84s)]
*  talking about your way into that story like what you read a little bit about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=161.96s)]
*  that in the essay about a few lines in the case for reparations that you felt [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=166.8s)]
*  like maybe you were glib about a history that was much more complex. I think [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=173.84s)]
*  glib is the correct word. You know when you're writing something radical as it [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=178.0s)]
*  was at the time you know in 2014 for the case of reparations you're really always [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=182.72s)]
*  trying to ground it in some sort of real thing so that people can perceive it and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=186.84s)]
*  in the case of case for reparations it was reparations and I want to be very [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=190.92s)]
*  clear about this from the state of Germany to the state of actually West [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=194.96s)]
*  Germany to the state of Israel not necessarily directly to Holocaust victims. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=199.16s)]
*  Right. I neglected to ask a very important question which is what is the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=203.48s)]
*  nature of that state because for me the case for reparations was not simply [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  about compensation for something that has been done but about making the world [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=215.2s)]
*  safe from a particular kind of oppression at large and as it turned out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=220.4s)]
*  as was very clearly revealed to me when I you know did my travels to use the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=225.88s)]
*  state of Israel, reparations to the state of Israel as an example actually [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=231.16s)]
*  undermined the very message of the thing I was trying to get across in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=235.24s)]
*  article. And why is that? Because Israel is an apartheid state and I don't mean [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=239.24s)]
*  that as a slur. I mean that in repeating the reports of Amnesty International. I [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=246.44s)]
*  mean that in reporting repeating the reports of the human rights campaign. I [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=251.04s)]
*  mean that in reporting the reports of Israeli human rights group B'tselem. I [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  mean that in reporting the fears of Israel's own prime ministers Ehud [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=261.24s)]
*  Barak, Ehud Omert. And I mean that in terms of what I actually saw which was a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=266.28s)]
*  society in which half the people live and have the benefits of full [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=272.04s)]
*  citizenship and the other half live on various tiers somewhere below that. This [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  was immediately clear to me the first day I got there and certainly by the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  second day when I was walking through Hebron and I literally saw streets [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=286.36s)]
*  where certain people could walk down and certain people couldn't. Where I could [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  walk down as long as I was clear that I was not Muslim and other people could [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  not. When it was made clear to me that I was with a group of people and spending a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=297.36s)]
*  group of people spending time with a group of people who should they fall [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=301.28s)]
*  into any sort of trouble or get into any sort of trouble would be treated by the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  military justice system while all around them were Israeli Jewish citizens who [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=308.84s)]
*  were subject to the benefits of the civil system. You can imagine the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=313.79999999999995s)]
*  difference in the degree of harshness there and it went on. It went on. You [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  know it's pretty clear across the board in terms of the laws and the policies. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=321.23999999999995s)]
*  I've been on the same streets in Hebron and had the same reaction which is that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  this is obviously a moral abomination. Obviously. Obviously. Obviously. But I [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=328.68s)]
*  thought about your case reparations essay because the gap from the case for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=334.52s)]
*  reparations is to me irrefutable and rock solid moral footing. Yes. It is the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=338.64s)]
*  case that American wealth was built in the plunder that there is something owed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  From that moral certainty to the okay well what are we going to do about it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  Things do start to get more complex. Yes. And from the moral certainty of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=353.36s)]
*  standing on a street in Hebron to this is not morally acceptable to how do we [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=356.68s)]
*  have 15 million people between the river and the sea with full equality peace [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  and flourishing. That is more complex. Yeah that is that is. But you know what. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  In many ways the next step is a lot clearer to me in fact than actually was [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=369.64s)]
*  the case for reparations because the other thing I was confronted with was the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=373.32s)]
*  extent to which Palestinian voices have been completely pushed out of the frame. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=377.12s)]
*  So the first step is actually an easy one to elevate you know the voices of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=382.2s)]
*  the people who are actually having the experience and ask them what should [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=386.2s)]
*  happen here. You know and not you know one or two of them you know but in some [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  sort of mass where you know in many ways that essay is about my complex [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=394.4s)]
*  relationship with journalism which I love which is a process I love which is [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=400.0s)]
*  one that I actually applied right there. But I have to tell you and I've said [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=404.12s)]
*  this and I'll continue to say is I would be very interested in how many major [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=407.96s)]
*  media organizations have a bureau in Jerusalem where they have a Palestinian [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=413.44s)]
*  correspondent or bureau chief. I would love to see those numbers. You know [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=418.12s)]
*  obviously I think you know anybody and anybody should have the opportunity to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  work that kind of job. Just like I think anybody should have the opportunity to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  cover a race in America. But if there were no black people doing it or very [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  few we'd have a problem with that. It's interesting you say that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=434.52s)]
*  It's interesting you say that because I thought about you choosing to write about [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  this topic. I thought of a conversation that you and I had before I wrote my [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  second book calling a nation which is about race and policing and the criminal [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  justice system in which I we were just talking as as friends and I was like I [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  don't know like I want to write this book but is it a little weird for a [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=458.72s)]
*  white guy to write this book. And you were like well you're an American. It's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  as much it's your story as much as anyone. So you should write about it. And [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=465.52s)]
*  you know in the case of this neither neither you or I or either Jewish [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=469.32s)]
*  Israeli Palestinian or Arab. But we're Americans and the American America is [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=473.4s)]
*  not some small part of what's going on over there. We're a large part of it and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  it's marked everywhere. You know there's an essay I talk you know an exhibit I [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=484.0s)]
*  talk about the city of David where I went to it is an actual plaque that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=487.44s)]
*  thanks America for its support. I was recently reading a report by a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=490.64s)]
*  Palestinian American scholar Nora Erica and Josh Paul who resigned from the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=496.24s)]
*  State Department and one of the points they made was every plane that drops a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=500.76s)]
*  bomb on Gaza was gotten from here. Those are our bombs. We're responsible and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=505.28s)]
*  that's what you know a lot of times a pushback is well look they're bad things [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=512.72s)]
*  happening you know all over the world. Why particularly are you picking on this [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=515.36s)]
*  one thing. I'm picking on because I'm responsible because it is the president [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=519.24s)]
*  of this country who have said we have a special relationship with Israel. So if [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=523.8s)]
*  we have a special relationship then I have to treat it specially if that's a [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=527.76s)]
*  word especially me. And so that that to me was what you know very much called me [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=532.04s)]
*  there. I want to talk about some other things in but I want one more point on [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=537.96s)]
*  this. The thing that I have already started to see people say about you and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=542.96s)]
*  the thing that I think you will see a lot of will be basically of the curve of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=548.0s)]
*  this form. That you are well meaning but naive smart and curious but essentially [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=551.36s)]
*  got led on a very one sided sort of propaganda tour a kind of Potemkin tour [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=559.48s)]
*  in which the full complexity you could have been taken to Sirot and you would [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=565.24s)]
*  have met Israeli families living under rocket fire right. You could have you [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=569.96s)]
*  could have this all happened for October 7th but you could have been taken to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=573.24s)]
*  Israeli victims of brutality and terrorism and things like that and that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=577.8s)]
*  you came away with this very one sided image from this one sided experience. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=583.08s)]
*  Well I'll say two things. The first thing is it is very very difficult to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=588.68s)]
*  spend almost 30 years in media as I have and not be very much exposed. In fact [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=594.52s)]
*  you live in America and be a thinking person and not be exposed to the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=604.04s)]
*  defenders of this project. It's just it's hard to do that. It's all around us. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=607.12s)]
*  So I was not that was not the thing I was lacking in familiarity with. The [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=611.68s)]
*  second thing I would say is look I am against the death penalty. OK. I don't [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=615.76s)]
*  care if the guy slaughtered 10 children and ate half of them. I don't think that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  person should be killed. There is nothing I would see that would change my opinion [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=628.2s)]
*  apartheid. Absolutely nothing. My case is not based on a higher or elevated [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=634.24s)]
*  Palestinian morality. It's not based on a notion that that Palestinians are [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=641.12s)]
*  somehow angels or somehow morally better than. This is what I believe about human [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=646.28s)]
*  beings and there's no thing that I would see that would make that go away. I am [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=650.5999999999999s)]
*  against segregation. I am against apartheid. I am against Jim Crow. Nothing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  will make that OK. Nothing nothing they can do would make that OK. There's a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=660.0s)]
*  line in the book that I think is kind of the thesis of the Ta-Nehisi project. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=664.36s)]
*  You were talking to two. There's an amazing organization called Breaking the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=670.08s)]
*  Silence. Yeah two folks that are Israelis who had served in the IDF and who then [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=674.28s)]
*  come out later to talk about what they had done and how morally vulnerable the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=679.28s)]
*  occupation is. And you say they were raised under the story that Jewish [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=685.56s)]
*  people were the ultimate victims of history but they had been confronted [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=689.88s)]
*  with an incredible truth that there was no ultimate victim that victims and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=693.56s)]
*  victimizers were ever flowing. This is true of human beings. This is true of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=698.1199999999999s)]
*  human beings and just like Zionism doesn't represent a particular Jewish [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=704.3599999999999s)]
*  exception or something that you know is being perpetrated and human beings [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  haven't done before that humans aren't capable of doing. You don't get an [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=712.44s)]
*  exception from the fact that victims victimize all the time. You know that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=717.5600000000001s)]
*  that is the nature of the thing and something that frankly I is you know a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=722.6s)]
*  black American carrying all of that you know in present and presently wrestling [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=727.7600000000001s)]
*  with. I mean you write about that in the Beautiful Struggle just at the micro [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=732.36s)]
*  level of your block in Baltimore. That's right. There is no inherent deep [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=735.6400000000001s)]
*  nobility. You know and now I'm speaking of my own people for having been [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=740.52s)]
*  subjected to enslavement Jim Crow etc. It's bad. It's wrong. Hopefully it confers [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=744.48s)]
*  some degree of wisdom upon you but sometimes it doesn't. You know what I [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=750.0s)]
*  mean? And sometimes people just decide hey the lesson actually is power. You [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=753.96s)]
*  know and so I look that part that you just quoted is actually very very [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=758.12s)]
*  important to me because the people you are quoting are people who served in the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=763.56s)]
*  IDF in the actual occupation. So it's like what was I supposed to do? You [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=768.44s)]
*  know I talked to people who were victims of it. I talked to people who did it. Is [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=775.4000000000001s)]
*  it that I did not talk to the right people who did it? You know I mean I'm [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=779.12s)]
*  just not that's that's hard for me. That's hard for me. In one of the essays [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=783.6s)]
*  the book you travel to South Carolina where you meet an English teacher who [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=788.08s)]
*  teaches an AP English class who had assigned Between the World and Me your [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=791.32s)]
*  second book. She signed it Between the World and Me. Yeah yeah yeah. Just checking. Just making sure. Between the World and Me to her AP English class and and pursuant to the sort of [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=796.72s)]
*  critical race theory panic that we saw come in the wake of 2020 and South [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=807.84s)]
*  Carolina law and complaints by local school board members it gets pulled and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=812.28s)]
*  you go down. I love it's a beautiful essay but I also just love the scene [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=816.0400000000001s)]
*  because you go there expecting basically this like full reactionary high. I was [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=821.56s)]
*  ready for it. Ready for it. And what you get what do you get when you get down? I [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=828.16s)]
*  think that we forget that when somebody says this is a very very red district [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  like that means like 70 30 and 30 percent is actually a lot of people who [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=837.52s)]
*  are fully capable of organizing themselves and and that's what I saw [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  that's what I saw. I saw that people were quite upset with the prospect that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=846.4799999999999s)]
*  this teacher Mary Wood who is from Chapin by the way. Homegrown. Teachers in the high school she went to that she would be driven out because she [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=851.52s)]
*  deign to expose her AP English class by the way you know to this book and folks [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=860.04s)]
*  turned out to support her you know and it was um it was magnificent to see. I do [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  think like there's a deep humanism that runs through this whole through I think [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=873.04s)]
*  your intellectual project and your writing project and through the book which comes back to this like there are no fixed categories that of [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=878.24s)]
*  human this and that the the the the race craft the desire to create these fixed [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=885.04s)]
*  categories is always in the tool of creating some hierarchy. Yeah. But that and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  that the work of writing and the intellectual work of clarity is to constantly be pulling away at that fiction. It is on what you just [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=897.36s)]
*  said is extremely uncomfortable and true. It's like the great difficulty of you know in my mind of being a writer because you never completely at home. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=907.56s)]
*  You never really like you never have the luxury of saying these are my people. We're right. We're OK. This is my side. No no these are my people [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=916.4399999999999s)]
*  culturally. These are my people historically. But I can't tell you that tomorrow I might not have to say something you know and I saw that I saw that in [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=924.16s)]
*  Israel by the way. Like I saw that up front that I might not have to say something I might have to say something that might you know find me an [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=933.96s)]
*  outcast you know from my own home. You know. Ta-Nehisi Coates is the author of The Message which I heartily heartily recommend you read. It is out now. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=941.08s)]
*  You can get it wherever you get your books. Thank you so much Chris. Thanks for having me back. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLzKy2N4s2M&t=951.76s)]
