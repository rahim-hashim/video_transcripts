# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights March 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0)
*  Eric Levitz wrote an interesting piece in your magazine where he says you get all this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=0.0s)]
*  demographic freak out on the right about like they're importing voters so that they can [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=3.92s)]
*  and it's like I don't think those people come over necessarily are even gonna vote against [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=8.34s)]
*  like you are doing more sort of a stereotyping of how people might vote that has actually [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=13.88s)]
*  worked and in fact you might be able to build a multiracial right-wing movement in America. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=20.92s)]
*  Imagine if you weren't talking about internment camps. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=26.52s)]
*  I mean just imagine what you could do if you really put your mind to it but I mean I think [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=28.88s)]
*  that first of all it's been really under reported the way in which disinformation has really [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=32.12s)]
*  grown and spread on Spanish language media right like the Biden campaign started early [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=37.96s)]
*  with outreach to Hispanic and black communities they need to keep up that outreach but I was [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=42.12s)]
*  reading the Tord DeForest profile of Joe Biden and the New Yorker this week by Evan Osnes [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=46.92s)]
*  and he talks to Sarah Longworth the bulwark and she has a really smart point which is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=51.34s)]
*  if Biden is not great at selling this where are the surrogates? Flood the zone. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=55.82s)]
*  Everywhere. The right wing is so adept at this right everything from talk radio to social [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=60.82s)]
*  media to the main networks I mean everybody's saying the same thing over and over and over [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=66.58s)]
*  and over again and the lies become truth. Here the truth needs to be accepted as the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=70.7s)]
*  truth and he needs so many ambassadors on his side saying that thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=75.34s)]
*  I keep thinking I think it's exactly correct because I think that you can't I mean the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=80.18s)]
*  word media is because we are an intermediary right like things happen here and you're here [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=84.46s)]
*  and what our job is to do literally is be like yeah right we're right in the middle [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  that's what we do we mediate okay that has collapsed to a degree that I haven't I mean [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=97.38s)]
*  not us but generally out there like I just don't know where anyone's getting their information [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=103.1s)]
*  right and I thought about that voter we had last night was talking about like health care [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  she had like real concerns like tangible this is like a real voter that you can really talk to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=111.5s)]
*  yeah health care an IEP for a kid and it's like how voters are connecting the dots like these are [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  the things I care about and these are the candidates and like even just the basic here's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=121.26s)]
*  where they are on the issues that to me is a big challenge too. Oh yeah and it's I think you're [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  right that the mediating role of there being a formal media in between things that happen in the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=130.38s)]
*  world and how people find out about them that's sort of dissolving a little bit as we move to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=136.3s)]
*  different forms and democratized forms of media is absolutely true but the other thing that is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=140.7s)]
*  like less comfortable to talk about is that what's replacing it to a large degree is bad faith bad [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  actor disinformation not misinformation not people you know getting stuff wrong by accident [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=153.98s)]
*  but deliberate disinformation and that space in Spanish language media and English language media [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=159.42s)]
*  and social media and all the other ways that people access information online is absolutely [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=165.58s)]
*  toxic right now and deliberately so it is not people trying hard and failing it is bad actors [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=170.62s)]
*  trying to destroy us as a country and the fact that that information space is policed almost not [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=176.46s)]
*  at all or is policed by actors who actually want that yes like Elon Musk yes exactly that is really [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=184.46s)]
*  that's a national security problem for the United States yeah and it's a Democrat I mean it's a real [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  Democratic challenge I mean it's a it's a short-term challenge for anyone trying to get any message out [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=194.38s)]
*  about what's going on yeah but it's also it's also just a profound it is the environment in which [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  this campaign is going to take place I have to say like having covered this and sort of watched it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  like this is the worst I've seen that information environment I would say since 2016 which is a bad [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  year for that and to your point about like surrogates and also the other thing they're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=213.74s)]
*  talking about like they're going to do a lot of paid media now where that paid media is going to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=218.7s)]
*  go and who it's going to reach and how well you can target it's going to matter a lot but there's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  going to be a lot of direct outreach to people that is going to matter a tremendous amount for [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=226.94s)]
*  precisely this reason they need to make an incredible volume of content yes they need to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=232.38s)]
*  make a lot of content from a gazillion different sources going to a gazillion different places and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=237.82s)]
*  I do not know if they are staffed for that they also I mean I I don't mean to indict the American [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  public because I'm guilty of this myself we've become very selfish in our media habits we want [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=247.34s)]
*  stuff that feels good looks good is funny is entertaining and that reality is often at odds [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=251.34s)]
*  with you know politics and policy and they have got to find a way to marry something that can go [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=257.18s)]
*  viral to a really important message that Biden needs to spread ahead of yeah and it's much easier [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=262.3s)]
*  to make stuff go viral when the message is our country is a disaster it is being beset by a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=266.86s)]
*  cabal of shadowy and all-powerful enemies we need somebody to break the rules and to come in here [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=273.1s)]
*  and to take over with an iron fist and vanquish all of our countries you know but like that's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=278.94s)]
*  something that you can do virally very easily the message that we're taking care of your student [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=284.3s)]
*  loans and you're going to be able to hold on to your health insurance and by the way we're bringing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=289.66s)]
*  inflation down and the economic yes the job market is good that's really hard to make sing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  the republicans give lots of fodder to the end of days thesis yeah I mean there's definitely a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=299.82s)]
*  fire and brimstone message that Biden could could perpetuate that would not be untruthful [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=304.7s)]
*  there's also the fact that this touches on something Steve's talking about I mean anytime [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=310.14s)]
*  you see a president whose approval rating is say you know in the 38 39 40 41 and that right [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=314.46s)]
*  what it means is that that person is losing parts of their own coalition their own voters [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=321.26s)]
*  right that's that's the so when you saw that 87 percent number again all these numbers like this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=326.7s)]
*  is all guesswork everyone's just taking like sampling has gone to hell in the world of polling [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=330.94s)]
*  people are doing their best but there's enough aggregate data over time to show certain things [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=335.74s)]
*  and it seems to me that like those kind of swing voters are the swing voters who won the first [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=341.18s)]
*  time are a key part but also like finding out like who are the people that voted last time [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=345.98s)]
*  in that 13 percent and where are they now and why not it's like the most low-hanging fruit and the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=349.98s)]
*  most well yeah I mean there I think the good thing is the information on voters the data that we have [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=354.7s)]
*  with the right resources is pretty extraordinary like they can find them if they want to find them [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=361.26s)]
*  it's terrifying it's very Orwellian but they can find them and I actually do have confidence in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=366.3s)]
*  their ability to find them whether they can convince them whether they can bring them back [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=370.62s)]
*  whether they can bring them back home again I think is an open question but I do think the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=374.86s)]
*  states the states are so enormously high that the recruitment of compelling characters and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=379.18s)]
*  interlocutors for this movement that is really the movement against tyranny to save American [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=384.94s)]
*  democracy it shouldn't be that hard popular funding to save American democracy and that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=389.9s)]
*  urgency I do think that you know one of the people things that people have been pointing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=394.38s)]
*  out is like people are not tuned in yet and they are pretty checked out and and and and Joe Biden [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=397.9s)]
*  has not been an omnipresent sort of person out there in the world and certainly not in the way [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump was but not in the way Barack Obama was how do you see that like you are really focused [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=408.38s)]
*  on this question of the survival of American democracy and and stitching together a popular [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=413.9s)]
*  front that will defend it yeah and it's happened before and it's what the project that you see [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=418.86s)]
*  happening now like how confident are you that that part of that is just a focus that like when people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=422.06s)]
*  lock in they get it well I mean I think that the idea the idea that wins is that there is a super [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=427.5s)]
*  majority in America that is for democracy I agree and it is a non-partisan super majority of people [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=434.86s)]
*  who disagree with each other on a million different things but there is one thing that is a very clear [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=441.82s)]
*  choice in this election and it is between having a democracy and not and if you can get people to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=447.9s)]
*  accept that basic idea which is a popular front idea if you can get people to see that Chris Hayes [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=453.58s)]
*  and Liz Cheney are in the same room for some reason and that might mean something I mean there's a [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=458.53999999999996s)]
*  million different you know dyads like that that you can draw I do think that you can get there over [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=463.41999999999996s)]
*  the next eight months this is an early time for the Republicans to be locking up their nominee but [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=468.78s)]
*  this is around the same time that John McCain locked it up in 2008 and John Kerry locked it up [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=474.06s)]
*  in 2004 and Al Gore locked it up in 2000 and there is this feeling when you get an early lockup in [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=478.94s)]
*  the primary wow this campaign's got a head of steam they've got they're going to carry this all the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=484.62s)]
*  way to the fall all three of those guys I just mentioned lost in the fall and and I think we [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=489.42s)]
*  should keep in mind what the timeline is here there's a lot of time and and a country that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  fundamentally I agree with you like I think a lot of work a lot of wood to chop yeah [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=498.54s)]
*  Alex Wagner what this is just a delight let's do this all the time I would just you want to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=504.38s)]
*  just go through nine yeah I'll let you go get back to iNews and that'll be all right thank you Chris [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=509.82s)]
*  in 2020 one of the crucial swing states that went for Joe Biden was not one you might have [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=518.22s)]
*  expected Arizona the longtime conservative bastion elected Barry Goldwater to the Senate and then [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=522.3000000000001s)]
*  nominee for president and elected John McCain to the Senate six times Arizona may prove to be a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=529.34s)]
*  pivotal state again this November not just for Biden but for control of the Senate tonight [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=535.02s)]
*  we know what the matchup will be in Arizona's key Senate race this year it will be hard right [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=539.6600000000001s)]
*  Republican Kerry Lake a bona fide Trump sick fin election denier against the Democrat congressman [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=544.86s)]
*  Ruben Gallego and Iraq were veteran there is no incumbent in the race here this year and that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=551.1800000000001s)]
*  is because in case you missed this news yesterday Kirsten Sinema the former Democrat turned [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=555.82s)]
*  independent who currently holds that seat and now she's dropping out of the race and leaving the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=560.94s)]
*  Senate at the end of her term it was the cause of jubilation of liberals everywhere but Sinema could [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=565.34s)]
*  be replaced by something even worse Kerry Lake ran for governor in 2022 and felt just very shy of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=571.82s)]
*  almost pulling it off Ruben Gallego represents much of Phoenix in Congress he's also the Democratic [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=578.3000000000001s)]
*  candidate for Senate from Arizona he joins me now it's first national TV interview since Senator [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=583.1s)]
*  Kirsten Sinema announced she is dropping out of the race and let's start with that congressman [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=587.98s)]
*  it's good to have you on the program were you surprised by that announcement which seemed to [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=592.46s)]
*  catch a lot of people by surprise outside of political circles or even inside political circles [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=597.74s)]
*  you know I don't know if I could say I was surprised or not surprised the way that we [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=603.66s)]
*  operating this campaign from day one was that we were going to win no matter who we were running [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=607.1800000000001s)]
*  against and I operated in that manner by going out to Arizona and going to some of the hardest [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=612.86s)]
*  places to reach talking to voters that had not been reached out to quite a while rural Republican [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=619.58s)]
*  voters went to urban Latino voters went to some of the hardest reaches places to reach when it [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  comes to Native American voters and we spoke to them about the issues they cared about every day [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=631.74s)]
*  and so I had confidence that whether or not Senator Sinema ran or any other person ran whether it was [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=636.94s)]
*  Republican was that if we took this approach that it was going to be a winning approach [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=643.26s)]
*  and I still feel that way and I you know very much thank Senator Sinema for her career in the United [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=647.74s)]
*  States Senate we may not have agreed on everything when it comes to our approaches about politics [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=656.06s)]
*  but she did great work for Arizona and I look forward to working with her in the future [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=662.38s)]
*  um your opponent uh Carrie Lake ran statewide two years ago uh she came very close to winning she's [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=666.94s)]
*  a former newscaster she's a she's a gift in her mind she's still running she's she sometimes [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=675.1s)]
*  declares herself the uh shadow governor of uh Arizona to be clear yeah I should I should say [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=679.9000000000001s)]
*  that one of the things that happened in 22 and people 2022 people may not recall this is that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=684.3000000000001s)]
*  after a number of Republicans lost races there was a question about whether anyone would attempt [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=689.1s)]
*  to pull a Trump and basically say that you know they were robbed and really [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=694.22s)]
*  Carrie Lake's the only one who really tried to do it who basically she tried to trump Trump it was [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=700.22s)]
*  it's very impressive yeah so she and she I think she even entered into litigation like her position [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=705.98s)]
*  is still that she won that election I take it she's still in litigation she is still trying to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=710.78s)]
*  contest a governor's uh race and I think it's actually quite ridiculous there were other there [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=715.98s)]
*  were two other Republicans actually won statewide on the ballot against her uh two other Republicans [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=720.3s)]
*  Republicans actually won more votes than she did there are Republicans that went and voted for two [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=725.9799999999999s)]
*  other statewide Republicans but they decided not to vote against her because they just did not find [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=731.5s)]
*  her a attractive uh candidate uh and yet she continues this litigation which obviously costs [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=736.14s)]
*  the taxpayer money but also it's actually costing people um some personal uh you know you know [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=742.14s)]
*  some actual personal issues you know we have elected officials that have gotten death threats [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=749.4200000000001s)]
*  that are not running for office anymore because uh you know Carrie Lake continues to deny the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=753.58s)]
*  outcomes of 2020 election to this day uh and I say to this day uh she actually just recently [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=759.82s)]
*  actually yesterday rejected again the outcome of the 2020 election and the 22 election uh in [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=767.0200000000001s)]
*  the rotunda of the Senate so this um uh she's not moving she's not moving she's not changing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=773.9000000000001s)]
*  she's a you know participating in the same election denialism uh that [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=779.9000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump engaged in in 2020 and has continued to be a danger to our democracy [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=784.22s)]
*  I want to ask you two specific policy questions um one is about legislation that actually Kirsten [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=789.6600000000001s)]
*  Sinema uh the current Arizona senator was key in negotiating which was the border legislation [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=795.9000000000001s)]
*  negotiated uh with Republicans um that was then immediately killed by Donald Trump and Mike Johnson [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=801.34s)]
*  would you vote for that if it did make it over to the house do you support that legislation [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=810.38s)]
*  when I was very public about this as soon as the legislation came out yes I would support it [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=815.4200000000001s)]
*  you know we have to recognize that we are in divided government we're not going to get [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  everything that we want there were some good elements to that bill for example the um uh you [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=825.1s)]
*  know afghan resettlement act was extremely important uh in that there was elements to bring in uh more [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=830.46s)]
*  uh workers through a visa program uh it also was really truly dealing with the issue at the border [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=837.26s)]
*  when it comes to our border communities that are very affected by our breakdown uh in immigration [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=844.7s)]
*  that's been happening for not just any administration but all administrations and so there are border [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=849.82s)]
*  communities that are hurting uh just trying to keep up uh with uh the broken immigration system [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=854.5400000000001s)]
*  and so this is a very good response it wasn't perfect and I think we have to accept that uh but [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=859.98s)]
*  you know it was really indicative that you know Carrie Lake didn't even read the bill [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=866.7s)]
*  she actually just rejected it outright and encouraged uh Republicans to reject it outright [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=871.02s)]
*  because Donald Trump said to reject it not because it was a bad bill but because it's a bad bill [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=875.58s)]
*  against their politics and so the difference between me and Carrie Lake is that I'm going to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=881.26s)]
*  really work for Arizona solutions she is just going to work for whatever Donald Trump wants [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=887.58s)]
*  and that's not what we need uh in Arizona uh final question for you the president uh will be [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=893.1s)]
*  offering a state of the union uh tomorrow what are you telling Arizona voters about what an agenda [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=899.1s)]
*  you see to be part of were you to to join the Senate and had a democratic majority and democratic [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=904.22s)]
*  president well number one I think the most important thing we need to talk about is a [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=911.0200000000001s)]
*  freedom agenda number one freedom for women to control their bodies the fact that we are about to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=915.02s)]
*  potentially elect a president who appointed the justices that overturn Roe v Wade and turn back [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=922.62s)]
*  the clock when it comes to uh you know women having control over their lives um again uh I [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=929.74s)]
*  think is something that we cannot discount so that's step one if you elect Donald Trump and [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=938.06s)]
*  Carrie Lake they're going to put Supreme Court justices uh on that Supreme Court they're going [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=943.98s)]
*  to assure that Roe v Wade will continue to be not the law of the land uh number two freedom real [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=948.62s)]
*  economic freedom we have done a lot of work in this administration to bring down the cost of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=956.14s)]
*  precision drugs to bring down the cost of insulin and continue to do other great work such as [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=960.38s)]
*  especially in Arizona of the expansion of a great economy especially when it comes to the CHIPS Act [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=967.58s)]
*  now we're not there yet there's still a lot of costs that we have to really bring down housing [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=972.62s)]
*  costs cost of other things and we're going to be able to do that in this administration with me as [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=978.46s)]
*  a senator are going to work to that do that for everyday Arizonans okay congressman Ruben Gallego [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=983.34s)]
*  thank you very much appreciate it [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=988.46s)]
*  you [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VGPoDQMn0&t=1002.62s)]
