# Trump must 'pay dearly for what he's done,' E. Jean Carroll lawyer tells jury
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs)
*  Donald Trump has made history in lots of ways, probably too many to count, but they include [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=0.0s)]
*  racking up an all-time record of impeachments and indictments for a president or ex-president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=4.24s)]
*  He has also, as far as I know, and at least in the modern era, come the closest of any [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=8.92s)]
*  president to being found guilty of sexual assault. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=13.08s)]
*  Last year, Trump was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming magazine writer E. Jean [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=16.96s)]
*  Carroll. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=21.56s)]
*  Now, it was litigated in a civil trial. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=22.56s)]
*  She sued him, which has a lower standard of proof than a criminal proceeding. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  But still, the jury deliberated on this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=28.38s)]
*  They got evidence. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=30.74s)]
*  They found him liable. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=31.74s)]
*  And the details are horrific. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=32.74s)]
*  I think it has largely escaped penetrating the American consciousness because there is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=34.58s)]
*  so much terrible stuff about him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=38.5s)]
*  Carroll accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room in the Bergdorf-Grunman department store [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=41.34s)]
*  in Manhattan in the 1990s. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=46.3s)]
*  He called her a liar. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=48.56s)]
*  She sued him for defamation, and she won, with the jury awarding her $5 million in damages [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=49.82s)]
*  last May. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=55.14s)]
*  Today, the day after his win in the Iowa caucus, the frontrunner for the Republican [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=56.14s)]
*  nomination was in court for the start of a second defamation trial over other instances [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=60.18s)]
*  of his dismissing Carroll's accusations as false. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=65.56s)]
*  The jury will be asked only to determine damages because, as the judge said in court today, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=68.78s)]
*  quote, it has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=72.98s)]
*  that he knew when he made the statements about Ms. Carroll the statements are false, that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=78.06s)]
*  he made them with reckless disregard. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=81.94s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Ruhmann was inside that courtroom today, and she joins me now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=84.9s)]
*  It's so good to have you here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=89.22s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=90.22s)]
*  So first of all, do you have any sense of why he went to the trial today? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=91.5s)]
*  I was a little surprised. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=95.62s)]
*  So I think there are two reasons that he went. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=98.18s)]
*  One is a convergence of a legal and political strategy because Donald Trump seems to understand [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=99.84s)]
*  full well that his popularity rises in proportion to his playing the victim. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=104.42s)]
*  And here, rather than allow Eugen Carroll to rope herself in the victimhood that she [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=109.5s)]
*  has, in fact, earned, he instead decided he would play the victim so that when he goes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=113.7s)]
*  back to New Hampshire, he can say, oh, I was trapped in that courtroom all day. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  I had to be there when I would so much rather be here with you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=121.42s)]
*  But I think the other reason that he went was to make eye contact with as many of the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=124.54s)]
*  people who are either decision makers or accusers here as possible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=129.5s)]
*  And just like at his arraignment in Florida last year, when he turned around, faced the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=133.62s)]
*  gallery and stared down a gallery full of press, including me, today, those stairs [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=138.1s)]
*  were reserved for the prospective jurors. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=143.54s)]
*  And it included not only looking at them as they answered the judge's questions, but also [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=145.5s)]
*  a lot of gesticulating. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  For example, when Judge Kaplan asked, does anyone here believe President Trump has been [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  treated unfairly by the justice system, two prospective jurors stood up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=157.42s)]
*  But former President Trump also answered the question, even though it wasn't directed at [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=161.14s)]
*  him by going like this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=165.34s)]
*  And he's a jury. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=167.5s)]
*  He's trying to sort of manipulate the jury as much as he can. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=169.1s)]
*  Now, the legal posture of this case, I had to go back and remind myself of it today. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=172.1s)]
*  So remind us, obviously, there was a trial. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=175.9s)]
*  We covered that trial. You covered that trial. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=178.66s)]
*  He was found liable in order to pay damages. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=180.58s)]
*  This is another trial. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=183.78s)]
*  What is the origin of this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=185.38s)]
*  So the trial last spring was about statements that Trump had made in October of 2022 on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=187.34s)]
*  the verge of a deposition in the case that's being tried right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=193.02s)]
*  After he was president. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=196.26s)]
*  Correct. And because he was no longer president, there was less legal wrangling about his [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=197.14s)]
*  liability. That case went to trial first. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=201.74s)]
*  Consider this trial about the book ends of defamation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=204.02s)]
*  This is principally about two statements he made in June of 2019 when E. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  Jean Carroll first came forward and published an excerpt of her memoir in New York [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=211.34s)]
*  magazine. But it's also from a punitive damages perspective about all the different [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=215.18s)]
*  times Trump has repeated those defamatory statements since, including, as her lawyer [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=220.22s)]
*  Sean Crowley pointed out today, as many as 22 times just today in a truth storm as he [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=226.17999999999998s)]
*  was sitting in court. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=233.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he has been again, this is this sort of connects to what I was saying in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  first. I mean, the way that he has talked about her on Truth Social is so despicable, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=237.33999999999997s)]
*  so disgusting, so beyond the pale and so unrepentant. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=242.05999999999997s)]
*  Right. Yes, right. Exactly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=245.82s)]
*  I mean, it's really. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=247.22s)]
*  Yes. And one of the things I think Sean did really effectively today in her opening was [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=248.22s)]
*  ask the jury not to consider a specific monetary number and punitive damages, but to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=252.82s)]
*  think about how to make that award significant, very significant. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=258.14s)]
*  And she said, I want you to think about this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  How much will it cost to make him stop? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=265.74s)]
*  And then paused and said, after all, this is a man who's a self professed billionaire. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  So when we talk about the quantum of damages here, even though E. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=275.7s)]
*  is not talking about specific monetary amounts, I think what they are aiming for is something [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=279.7s)]
*  that really feels like a punch in the gut to former President Trump and causes him to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  think twice about continuing to do what he has done even as recently as this morning. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=289.17999999999995s)]
*  Right. And what he has been found civilly liable for doing and is causing damage, damage [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  we should mention again over and above the sexual assault that he was found liable for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=299.82s)]
*  by a civil jury. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  And this trial isn't about the sexual assault. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  In fact, the jurors have to presume that that sexual assault happened, that it is true, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=308.42s)]
*  that it was proven. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=312.94s)]
*  There was so Trump's lawyer also made her case today or opening arguments. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=314.3s)]
*  What I read of it again, gross. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=320.1s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=321.94s)]
*  Anyway, it was gross. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=323.74s)]
*  There was an interesting exchange between her and Judge Kaplan that I thought of you, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=326.7s)]
*  because the last time you were sitting this table, we were talking about lessons from [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=330.58s)]
*  the civil trial in New York of Judge Ngoran and how to deal with Trump lawyers and how [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  to deal with Trump. And one of the things you and I discussed was no has got to mean [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=340.18s)]
*  no. You can't let them to keep litigating thing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=343.86s)]
*  And Kaplan said something in court today almost literally like it was he had watched our [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  segment when she tried to push on something. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=351.1s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'd like to take credit for Kaplan watching our segment where we talked [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=354.86s)]
*  about sort of the vending machine theory of parenting and how it applies to judging. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=358.22s)]
*  Right. You put a quarter in and you get something out. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=362.3s)]
*  You're going to keep doing it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=364.14s)]
*  Kaplan has always been that person. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=365.82s)]
*  And I think you could have a dozen former federal prosecutors from New York come on [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=367.26s)]
*  your show and tell you he has always been very tough on litigants. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=371.14s)]
*  And when he says no, he's always meant to know. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=376.02s)]
*  The question was, was that the Lou Kaplan that was going to show up at this court, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=378.41999999999996s)]
*  particularly with Donald Trump in front of him? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=381.7s)]
*  And indeed, today it was. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=383.86s)]
*  And I hope it remains so. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=385.06s)]
*  Yeah. He said, Ms. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=386.3s)]
*  Saba, that when I say when I issue a ruling, it is the end of discussion, not the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=387.74s)]
*  beginning of an argument, which I thought was a very clear message about how he wants [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=391.98s)]
*  us to go. There's going to be another another day in court tomorrow. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=397.38s)]
*  And we're expecting the former president to be there as well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=401.3s)]
*  And E. Jean Carroll will be in that courtroom. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=403.78s)]
*  That's right. And instead of staring at the back of her head, which was the only glimpse [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=405.58s)]
*  he got of her today, he's really hoping to stare down the barrel of the courtroom right [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=408.9s)]
*  into her eyes, something no person who's been victimized by Donald Trump should have [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=413.06s)]
*  to face. Truly despicable. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=417.1s)]
*  All around all of it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=420.98s)]
*  Lisa Rue, thank you very much. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=422.26000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZkQOH5TMVs&t=423.58000000000004s)]
