Video Description: “The trains of thought have gotten shorter and shorter and shorter. They've gotten more digressive. And he's doing a lot of media, mostly with very friendly outlets—but when you look at the answers, it is just nonsense,” says Chris Hayes. Michelle Goldberg and Faiz Shakir join to discuss that and the state of the race.

# ‘Unintelligible’ Trump’s mental decline on display in final stretch to election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU)
*  Donald Trump has been canceling interviews left and right in the waning days of his campaign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=0.0s)]
*  But still found time to appear in a conservative podcast that was released earlier today where he blamed Ukraine's president [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=4.14s)]
*  For his country getting invaded by Russia. I [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=11.3s)]
*  Think Zelensky is one of the greatest salesmen I've ever seen [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=15.72s)]
*  Every time he comes in we give him a hundred billion dollars who else got that kind of money in history [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=19.2s)]
*  There's never been and that doesn't mean I don't want to help him because I feel very badly for those people [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=24.259999999999998s)]
*  But he should never have let that war start [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=30.779999999999998s)]
*  That war is a loser [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=34.86s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg is an opinion columnist New York Times her latest column is titled America's on the brink of a great political realignment [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=37.4s)]
*  It's already visible in Arizona fashion care serves as the campaign manager for the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=43.26s)]
*  He's now the co-founder and executive director more perfect union and they join me now [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=48.62s)]
*  First of all, I'm just to start with like a sort of somewhat superficial but to me [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=53.38s)]
*  Legitimate thing he sounds really weird Donald Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=58.7s)]
*  He's got this Bryant Brando and apocalypse now thing going on with his voice [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=61.94s)]
*  At all the things he the trains of thought have gotten shorter and shorter and shorter [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=66.58s)]
*  They got more aggressive and he's doing a lot of media [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  Mostly with very friendly outlets like that podcast, but when you look at the answers there it is just nonsense [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=73.66s)]
*  It's unintelligible it is on you like if you printed it in the newspaper just kind of verbatim [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  It would look like it was a random word generator and yet and he's I still think that we club the collective [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=84.54s)]
*  We are under reacting to that bizarro [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=91.08s)]
*  Kind of musical event that he did the other night. I mean if Joe Biden had done anything [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=94.92s)]
*  Remotely similar if he'd done it for five minutes [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=102.04s)]
*  Nevermind 40 minutes swaying on a stage while playing music and saying nothing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  Well, everybody sort of pretended it was normal and looked around awkwardly and tried to figure out how to respond [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=108.4s)]
*  The calls for Joe Biden to get out of the race the calls for anyone else to get out of the race [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean our ability to our kind of ability to understand or talk about what's normal is so out of whack and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=119.4s)]
*  obviously, you know Trump being senescent is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=128.12s)]
*  Pretty far down the list of kind of reasons why he shouldn't be president [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=131.6s)]
*  Unless there's something going on here. Yes. I joke the other day is a little like the food is terrible and the portions are too small [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=136.56s)]
*  One who kind of can't accomplish anything [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=145.32s)]
*  Faz it's interesting to me. So there's there's a there's always a sort of choice with Trump on what you're hitting him on and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=148.44s)]
*  It's interesting to me two things one that they have been really going on the democracy stuff [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=153.84s)]
*  Millie that the threats he's been making January 6th hammering that at the same time when you're looking at their ad spend [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=158.88s)]
*  The ads are running are very meat and potatoes. He's for billionaires. He's gonna get billionaires a tax cut [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=165.36s)]
*  We're gonna look out for middle-class folks and it seems to me like they're they're kind of covering both those lanes in different ways [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  What do you think? I? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=177.44s)]
*  Think you're right about the ad strategy. I want to see more of it as an appeal to working-class people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=179.8s)]
*  When you look at the events that they have done and they stand with Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney and then you've got Mark Cuban [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=185.56s)]
*  Today and you've got efforts to speak to crypto and you've got efforts to distance from Lena Conn [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=190.56s)]
*  I'm like, that's all I understand. We got a big tent. We got appeal to everybody, but don't forget [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=195.14s)]
*  Here's a you know, Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren AOC working-class people Sean Fain [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  I think she's gonna do an event with her with him tomorrow [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=203.56s)]
*  I think knock on wood, but I think don't lose that we work best right Biden 2020 work best with it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=205.64s)]
*  It's all of the above coalition [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=210.8s)]
*  I think in a recent column Michelle reminded us of the old quote of 2016 in which Democratic leaders were saying hey [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=212.08s)]
*  You get for every working-class vote. We lose out Western PA will gain two in suburban [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=217.56s)]
*  Philadelphia that was wrong and why is it wrong because when you're looking when you're leaking from the working-class bucket [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=222.24s)]
*  That's a big bucket Chris. You don't leak from that bucket. You want to fight for that bucket? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=227.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the thing about this realignment, which is what I mean this look everyone's swimming upstream of the realignment [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so the realignment is happening and and the Biden administration has done a ton to try to and by realignment [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=237.52s)]
*  I mean, you know non college voters moving towards Republican MAGA ism across racial and demographic lines [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  College-educated voters women voters particularly single women particularly women with degrees and advanced degrees moving towards towards Democrats [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=251.08s)]
*  The question of like how you what do you do with that gravity, right? How do you right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=258.56s)]
*  Is the big question for both campaigns right you go to war with the coalition you have not the coalition that you want [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  right, and so I think that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=268.38s)]
*  You know dumb Joe Biden had a theory of the case [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=270.86s)]
*  Which is that Democrats have lost working-class have been bleeding working-class support [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=273.94s)]
*  Because of their economic policies, you know because of NAFTA because of free trade because of offshoring all these things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=278.86s)]
*  And he is going to start kind of making the investments that a pro-worker Democratic party needs to make [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=285.94s)]
*  Having the industrial policy that a pro-worker diamond Democratic party needs to make and those things I think are correct [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=293.1s)]
*  regardless of the political [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=299.86s)]
*  Benefits but the political benefits have been scant [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=303.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know and it could just be that it takes much a much longer time to rebuild that kind of trust [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  But Kamala Harris doesn't have a much longer time, right? And so there really are a lot of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=312.5s)]
*  There weren't enough disaffected Republicans to save Hillary Clinton in 2016 [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=318.82s)]
*  But there are a significant lot of them out there [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  They're the reason that Arizona is now a state completely dominated by Democrats when it used to be a state completely dominated by Republicans [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=326.58s)]
*  And where Democrats are still the third smallest party in the state [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=332.94s)]
*  Do you think the question about Trump Trump how much Trump is doing media and how much she's talking to media? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=336.78s)]
*  There are different views on this which is that one school is more attention to him the better for him because that's the thing that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=343.48s)]
*  He feeds off of the others at the more attention him the worst for him because people actually when he's in their face [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  Don't like him that much. He is doing a lot of sort of friendly media. He's canceled a whole bunch of interviews [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  Where are you on that particularly down the stretch here because it's this is the key point. I [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  Mean for there, you know, I tend to believe that a majority of Americans are not for Trump [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=364.36s)]
*  You know 81 million votes against him last time I'd like to believe that will still remain the case will defeat him [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=369.36s)]
*  I think they know that they've got a cap too [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=374.44s)]
*  so for them that the cost of being mocked by their critics is less because is baked in with their sense of they just need to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=376.5s)]
*  mobilize a certain number of people who they've identified and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  However, he's gonna continue to say whatever he's gonna say is somehow gonna try to mobilize that base [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=388.44s)]
*  And that's who all who they're talking to and there's less persuasion for him [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=393.4s)]
*  Whereas for Kamala Harris my response to Michelle and some of that is that I having gone through Michigan, Wisconsin [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=396.84s)]
*  I think that the people are open to her even in union halls [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  They were not sold fully and they're open to her [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  So that the case for her is stronger and that's why I don't want to see us lose on just talking to some of these [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  Folks I feel like you know, even you and I have watched her try to distance herself from Biden [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=412.52s)]
*  There's a way in which you do that successfully. I think you say hey, you know [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=416.9s)]
*  I wish that Joe Biden got harder at housing costs as one of my first things I'm gonna do [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm gonna go after this. I wish she had gone stronger in Social Security [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=424.21999999999997s)]
*  I wish she had raised the minimum wage [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  That's a way in which you distance and do it in a way that appeals to some of these votes that we really need [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=428.58s)]
*  It is interesting how much housing has been has been central on the policy agenda [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  Although again, I also at this point remain a little skeptical about how much policy matters truly [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=437.21999999999997s)]
*  I would like it to but I just I'm just not quite it's not clear as it as an empirical matter [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=442.86s)]
*  It may not it may not be policy, but it is a knowledge and understanding of I know your life [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  I know what you're going through that does matter [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdfxwqXVWaU&t=453.82s)]
