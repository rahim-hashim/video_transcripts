# 'They quietly did their job' Hayes on the truth about Biden’s economic recovery
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are just a few weeks from the first votes actual vote votes being cast in the early [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=0.0s)]
*  nominating contest for the presidential election and one of the main [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=7.0s)]
*  points of discussion central [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=11.16s)]
*  Focuses heading into this election centers around the economic well-being of our country [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=13.44s)]
*  That's because generally speaking how people feel about the economy writ large is largely predictive and how an incumbent president [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=18.52s)]
*  Will perform if and when they run for reelection a lot of people have noticed that there's a strange [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  Paradox at the center of our economy, which is that if you look at many if not most of the empirical [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=31.52s)]
*  Metrics the economy is doing surprisingly well if you look at economic sentiment [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=37.44s)]
*  However, how people feel about the economy the numbers are near? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=42.8s)]
*  historically pessimistic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=47.04s)]
*  There's a real gap between how the economy is actually doing at least based on most of the measurements [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=48.68s)]
*  We normally use and how people think the economy is doing or I should say at the very least [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=54.96s)]
*  How they tell pollsters they feel about it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=61.04s)]
*  You can see it here on this chart [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=64.04s)]
*  You see how the the blue line how you'd expect people would feel about economic numbers and the red line [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=65.72s)]
*  How they actually feel have usually been in sync right like when things get worse people feel worse when they get better people feel [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=70.64s)]
*  better [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=76.84s)]
*  Right now there's a huge gulf between them [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=77.6s)]
*  That gulf it is worth noting does not exist in similar wealthy countries like France and Germany in the UK [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=81.08s)]
*  it's only here even though we're doing a lot better than those places and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=87.88s)]
*  Because of this this huge debate is broken out about how to explain this fundamental gap [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  Now one argument is that people feel so badly about the economy because well, they're still [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=97.16s)]
*  frustrated by the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Experience of the last few years or that there are certain things like housing prices right now that are still very high [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  And it's true housing prices are high right now, and that's hard [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=109.78s)]
*  Others argue that Americans are just getting inundated with negative messaging about the economy [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=114.38s)]
*  Now I gotta say I'm definitely very invested in understanding this phenomenon [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=119.7s)]
*  But it's worth actually taking a step back just to kind of look at the actual economic record of the incumbent president [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=123.26s)]
*  What sort of circumstances has he inherited? What has he accomplished? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=129.3s)]
*  independent of the public perception [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=133.98s)]
*  Let's look at how we got to where we are now [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=136.02s)]
*  The theme of the Biden presidency has been inheriting a succession of essentially [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=139.38s)]
*  unprecedented crises crises that have afflicted the entire world and have produced way worse economic outcomes in other pure countries [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean the source of all this of course right the original sources that we had as you might remember a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=151.82s)]
*  Once-in-a-century pandemic globally that killed millions of people shut down most of the world economy shut down entire industries [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=157.66s)]
*  And then we tried to come back out of it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=165.62s)]
*  That's the basic thing to remember now as president you get credit for things when things are good [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=168.54s)]
*  You get blamed on when things are bad, even if they're out of your control in both directions [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean we saw this in 2019 when Donald Trump had done essentially nothing to help the American economy [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=178.45999999999998s)]
*  In fact tried his best to hurt it with those massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations in a ridiculous trade war [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=183.98s)]
*  But he still presided over an economy that was finally recovering after financials crisis a decade later [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=191.18s)]
*  And he got the credit for it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  We also saw it in 2020 to a certain extent when kovat annihilated the US economy and the incumbent president Donald Trump lost [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  And once Joe Biden took over basically from the very moment [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  He was sworn in we became inundated with negative messaging about the economy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=209.78s)]
*  Some of it out of it was rooted in real crises the administration had to tackle a lot of it was overhyped [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=214.82s)]
*  Now this collective freakout about the economy happened across the media ecosystem, but it was most pronounced on Fox News [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  I think it's worth taking a look at what exactly Americans have been hearing about the economy over the past three years and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  Compare that with the actual circumstances and crucially how the Biden White House responded, right? They inherit the circumstance how they responses up to them [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's start with the issue of labor of workers [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  Biden took office amid an unprecedented global pandemic remember there was not even a widely available vaccine when he was sworn in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=247.48s)]
*  As a result the Biden administration continued the economic stimulus from the Trump pandemic response, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=255.0s)]
*  They passed on a party line vote the American rescue plan [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=260.56s)]
*  huge huge huge amount of aid to families directly included additional direct cash payments an additional [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=263.8s)]
*  $300 a week in unemployment benefits. This was a big risk. Let's remember and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  Fox's response to labor shortages, which were real amid a deadly global pandemic was that suddenly? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=274.24s)]
*  No one wanted to work anymore [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  Biden created a labor shortage because he gave workers way too much free money [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=285.36s)]
*  183,000 people dropped out of the labor force Biden created a labor shortage labor shortage labor shortage an 81 year old woman [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  Pitches in during the nationwide labor shortage [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  They just can't find people with the labor shortage your people are making more money to stay home [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=301.76s)]
*  They're bringing out the robots now some businesses had trouble finding workers [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=306.76s)]
*  It was a real challenge for the White House [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  Especially when the Delta variant hit that summer and more than a hundred thousand people were still being hospitalized every week [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=312.28s)]
*  But then what happened? Well, the Biden administration continued its vaccination campaign [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  The virus subsided in its acuity to a level where people were comfortable going to work in person [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  Equally as important the bold and agenda of economic stimulus really worked unemployment rates dropped massively [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=328.84s)]
*  From six point three percent when President Biden took over to three point nine percent in the last jobs report [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  Again, you can see it right there on the chart. That's a chart that you want to go down, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=341.96s)]
*  That's the unemployment rate you want it to go down [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  And you don't need an to be an economist to understand that the line did just that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=350.04s)]
*  People definitely do want to work. It's a hot job market [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=355.04s)]
*  So, okay Fox mostly moved off the nobody wants to work any more narrative once the jobs numbers improved [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  It was clear people did not work [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=364.72s)]
*  Then there was a new boogie man in town the supply chain now again to be clear these issues were very very real again [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=366.44s)]
*  Especially in the aftermath of kovat which disrupted just about everything [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  Fox took the opportunity starting all the way back in October 2021 [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=377.68s)]
*  spinning the yarn that Biden was both responsible for the supply chain issues and apparently doing it to room Christmas for [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=382.24s)]
*  America's children [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  The Christmas presents you want probably stuck on a ship somewhere [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  Economists are warning many Christmas presents for your kids [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=395.36s)]
*  They're not gonna be arriving in time the holidays have been harder this year for many Americans. Thanks to Joe Biden [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=398.16s)]
*  Can we call Joe Biden Scrooge or the Grinch yet the Grinch who stole Christmas the Grinch who stole Christmas and American greatness [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=403.64s)]
*  Democrats are going to be stealing our children's future [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Just like the Grinch in the middle of the night slithering around those presents [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=414.84s)]
*  You get that you got the comparison to the Grinch the famous dr. Seuss character ruins Christmas [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=418.88s)]
*  But months before Fox started its latest war on Christmas [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=423.84s)]
*  President Biden had already put together this task force to combat the supply chain issues by the fall [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=426.76s)]
*  He announced the Port of Los Angeles will be working 24 7 to clear the backlog as well as additional [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=431.76s)]
*  Investments from UPS and FedEx to make sure packages got moving by November [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=437.0s)]
*  The heads of a bunch of major retail companies were shouting from the rooftops that there was no supply chain issue affecting holiday shopping [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=441.24s)]
*  In fact holiday spending in 2021 grew nearly 15% from the year before [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=447.88s)]
*  Shattering all kinds of records crisis averted the presents were under the tree [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=453.76s)]
*  To be clear it was not just Christmas presents early last year [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=458.64s)]
*  But administration was also dealing with a very real and very scary forage of shortage of baby formula [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=461.68s)]
*  It put together another plan to increase supply and fix allocation issues [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=467.88s)]
*  Which were caused both by a shuttered factory and a product recall the White House later declared that production had actually increased [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=471.8s)]
*  Year over year under their watch by October shell stock rates were back where they were before the crisis started [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=479.2s)]
*  Okay, so by this point Biden's been present for two years the midterm elections were approaching [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=486.36s)]
*  Republicans didn't have a ton to run on especially after that Dobbs decision struck down abortion rights their best [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=490.88s)]
*  Hope the central hope was to run on the economy and specifically inflation [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=496.48s)]
*  which really had been spiking for a whole bunch of neat reasons including around the world and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=500.44s)]
*  partly because of a hot labor market as well as those lingering disruptions from the pandemic and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=505.72s)]
*  Fox News did its level best to act as the messaging arm of the Republican Party spending day after day after day talking about [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=511.04s)]
*  eggs [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=519.32s)]
*  Egg prices for the month of December up [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=521.32s)]
*  60% 59.9 percent on eggs eggs now are through the roof the price of eggs prices on eggs egg prices [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=524.76s)]
*  Inflation is real eggs are so expensive the egg has become so expensive [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=532.76s)]
*  No more Easter eggs everybody I know is getting chickens so they can have their own eggs [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=538.4s)]
*  Now inflation is actually an interesting case in that it really wasn't about broader inflation at all in early [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  2022 an avian flu outbreak killed tens of millions of egg laying chickens yet [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=549.1600000000001s)]
*  Another example of the supply crunch out of the president's control. Guess what the ship corrected course [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=554.0400000000001s)]
*  Farmers were able to raise new chickens egg prices came right back down your omelet is not in danger [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=559.4s)]
*  But believe it or not eggs were not the primary target of Fox's breathless inflation coverage [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=564.52s)]
*  No, Fox saved the big guns for perhaps the most salient political issue of our time [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the pain at the pump [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=576.72s)]
*  We're paying some of the highest gas prices per gallon in American history at another daily record high gas prices [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=578.48s)]
*  They're through the roof gas prices are through the roof gas prices are through the roof gas prices are now through the roof [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=585.12s)]
*  Gas prices are through the roof gas prices are through the roof pain in the gas gas prices surging [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=591.04s)]
*  Republicans and their allies in the media were nothing if not on message again the 2022 midterms were supposed to be about one issue inflation [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=597.88s)]
*  Specifically at the pump where you see the prices every day and in theory that should have been a pretty clear attack after all [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=605.0s)]
*  There was a major land war in Europe any mass blockade of Russian oil and oil prices [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=610.88s)]
*  Really really went up at one point gas was averaging more than five bucks a gallon did Joe Biden cause that no he did not [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=616.8s)]
*  Does it matter? Well? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=622.68s)]
*  This single-minded campaign message was not particularly effective [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=624.4s)]
*  Especially when being delivered by some truly terrible candidates and the big red wave did not materialize [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=627.84s)]
*  So you got to think that many voters simply did not blame the Democrats for high gas prices even after months of folks [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=634.5s)]
*  Plastering stickers of President Biden labeled I did that at gas pumps those stickers by the way might be sending quite the different message these days [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean for better or for in my opinion worse [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=648.28s)]
*  Domestic oil production is booming under President Biden [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=652.8399999999999s)]
*  We're producing more oil than Saudi Arabia and Russia and guess what gas prices are way down from their highest peak last year [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  The national average is hovering at about 322 a gallon the lowest in nearly a year following a steady decline [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  And that tracks of all kinds of prices inflation has cooled [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  Dramatically over the past year with rates steadily declining from a peak of about 9% last year down to about 3.2% [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=674.24s)]
*  So again, you don't really hear Fox News talking too much about the price of gas these days or the price of eggs or Christmas presents [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=681.68s)]
*  And so the story of the Biden presidency so far has been almost like this the series of metaphorical meteors hitting the earth [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  Unexpected in many cases unprecedented crises, but the White House had to attend to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=695.76s)]
*  And each one has caused huge cycles of negative coverage enormous around-the-clock panic [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  across the media [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  And in basically every case the Biden administration has attempted to do something about the problem in many cases. They saw real tangible success [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=708.0s)]
*  Which is to say in most cases they just quietly did their job then they moved on to the next crisis [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  But that is not the message getting through on Fox News. No, the message on Fox is that the entire economy is going to collapse [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=722.24s)]
*  any minute now [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=728.72s)]
*  First, let me say for the record. It's a recession. I i'm telling you it's a recession [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  It smells like a recession it walks like a recession [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=734.6400000000001s)]
*  It's a recession. We begin tonight with the Biden recessions the Biden recession the Biden recession the Biden recession [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=738.08s)]
*  The auto industry is in recession. The housing industry is in recession retail is in recession [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  Advertising is in recession recession. That's a certainty. We have dismal consumer and business confidence because [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  We're hearing recession recession recession [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's interesting because she's right at one level [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=760.56s)]
*  The dismal confidence is probably because they're hearing recession recession recession, except there is no imminent recession [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=764.2399999999999s)]
*  According to a recent survey business economists the overwhelming majority of them more than 75 percent [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=770.7199999999999s)]
*  Do not believe a recession is that a recession is likelier than not in fact [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  The fundamentals of the economy are much sounder than you might think they are [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=780.24s)]
*  GDP GDP is absolutely booming even more importantly. This is central real wages are rising [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=784.48s)]
*  That means wages right now are rising faster than inflation, which means working people have more purchasing power [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=790.64s)]
*  In fact, the largest wage gains have happened in the bottom 40 percent of workers [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=796.56s)]
*  from the bottom up [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=803.28s)]
*  The certain recession is now far from certain it may even appear unlikely which itself is a minor miracle [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=805.2s)]
*  We are left in this weird environment where people do genuinely feel very bad about the economy [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=812.32s)]
*  And i'm not telling anyone how to feel or what their finances are people feel how they feel if they're stressed [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=816.24s)]
*  They're stressed housing prices are fine. That's true [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=821.36s)]
*  But as I said the weird thing about presidents the way that credit and blame work in the public consciousness [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=824.4s)]
*  Presidents get blamed for the bad stuff praised for the good [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=828.8s)]
*  Even when say the fed had more to do with cooling inflation the white house does [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=831.6s)]
*  But I also think that from the perspective of economic management dealing with what's dealt you [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=836.48s)]
*  President biden is just not getting the praise he deserves [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=841.76s)]
*  If you are evaluating presidential performance, you got to keep the rules consistent [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=844.96s)]
*  Donald trump and his buddies on fox want to praise him for the great economy from 2017 through 2019 [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=849.76s)]
*  While ignoring the 2020 disaster that unfolded under his watch [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=855.2s)]
*  They want you to believe trump's term only lasted three years and then he just disappeared [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=858.88s)]
*  Before biden took over and a bunch of bad stuff happened under his watch [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  The actual record is that donald trump oversaw the biggest job loss of a president in [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=867.76s)]
*  American history along with math's death and abject disaster [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=874.38s)]
*  Now you might say that was not all trump's fault and fair enough [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=879.52s)]
*  But inflation the supply chain and eggs and russia's invasion of ukraine and spiking gas prices and shipping backlogs [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=883.4399999999999s)]
*  Those are not president biden's fault either [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=890.24s)]
*  But he has gotten to work putting together an economic vision [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=893.52s)]
*  Completely opposite of donald trump who cut taxes for corporations and rich people as his signature economic move [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=896.3199999999999s)]
*  As president biden likes to say he wants an economy from the middle up [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=903.36s)]
*  From the bottom up [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  And it's actually produced tangible [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=909.36s)]
*  Benefits more workers unionized higher pay [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=911.76s)]
*  And the best economic performance of any president under extremely difficult conditions this nation has seen [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=915.92s)]
*  Since franklin delano rosenbaum [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  You [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1nZv9Lusnk&t=941.36s)]
