# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 5
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo)
*  While Donald Trump is slated to head to trial in March for his role in the attempted coup, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tarrio, who is 39 years old, will spend the next 22 years behind bars for trying to carry [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=4.48s)]
*  out a conspiracy to steal the election, overthrow the government, and keep Trump in power. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=9.92s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland released a statement saying, quote, Today, the leader [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=15.3s)]
*  of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, learned the consequence of conspiring to oppose, by [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=18.6s)]
*  force, the lawful transfer of presidential power in 22 years, is 22 years in federal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=22.92s)]
*  prison. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Tom Jackman is a reporter for The Washington Post. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=29.84s)]
*  He's actually at the courthouse for the sentencing, and he joins me now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=31.56s)]
*  Tom, take us inside today. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=35.12s)]
*  I was getting dispatches from some of the reporters in that media room where you were [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=36.72s)]
*  watching the proceedings. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=39.84s)]
*  It seemed like a long process and like the judge had a lot to say. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=41.54s)]
*  Well, it was four hours. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=44.28s)]
*  It might have been the New World Record for longest sentencing in one of these cases. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=46.36s)]
*  And the judge did have a lot to say. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=50.56s)]
*  There was a lot of talking that went on in this trial, not by him. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=52.84s)]
*  So here was his chance to say, I don't think this guy feels sorry about what he did. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=55.64s)]
*  As you mentioned earlier, Tarrio did stand up and say, I apologize to law enforcement. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=61.42s)]
*  I apologize to the people of Washington, D.C. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  The people of the law enforcement people are heroes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=69.76s)]
*  And the people of Washington didn't deserve to have their city turned upside down. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=72.68s)]
*  And after he was done, the judge said, I think we're talking past each other. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=76.52s)]
*  I don't think I've heard any remorse from this guy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=80.48s)]
*  He's not addressing the whole seditious conspiracy thing, which he didn't. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=83.72s)]
*  That's striking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=89.28s)]
*  And, you know, we had the news last week of Dominic Pizzola, who said he was sorry, that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=90.28s)]
*  it was a mistake. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=96.96s)]
*  And I think he might even shed a tear or two. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=97.96s)]
*  And then cried a lot. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=100.56s)]
*  He cried a lot. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=101.8s)]
*  And then once it was once it was done, you know, after he had his 10 year sentence, he [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=102.8s)]
*  yelled Trump won. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=107.52s)]
*  We also have that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  We have Joseph Biggs, who is on Infowars. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  I want to play him, too, because this gives you a sense of the preamble to this judge [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=113.52s)]
*  deciding to take their time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=118.12s)]
*  This is Joseph Biggs on Infowars Saturday calling for a pardon. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=120.36s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=123.36s)]
*  Oh, I know he'll pardon this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=124.36s)]
*  I believe that with all my heart. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=126.48s)]
*  You know, the thing is, is hopefully getting him, you know. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=128.2s)]
*  For him to be able to get into the position where he can at least be, I think, on the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=132.96s)]
*  ballot to run right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=137.44s)]
*  Because once you have one minute remaining. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=138.44s)]
*  I do believe that Donald J. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=141.76s)]
*  Trump will pardon us. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=143.04s)]
*  And he should. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=145.0s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=146.28s)]
*  You know, we're his supporters. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=147.88s)]
*  We went there like he asked. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=149.64s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  I wonder, you know, how much you can't read the mind. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=153.04s)]
*  But that was an interesting context, given what this judge decided to do today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=156.2s)]
*  Did you hear that recording that said you have one minute remaining? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=160.76s)]
*  That's the recording you get when someone calls collect from jail. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=163.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  He only had one minute left in that interview. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=166.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  These people have been waiting for Trump to save them for a long time, and they may be [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  waiting a lot longer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=173.88s)]
*  But that's definitely their their last best hope. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=175.55999999999997s)]
*  But in the meantime, they're going to be spending time in prison. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=179.56s)]
*  Big Scott, 17 years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  He was, you know, on the front lines that day with them bullhorn directing people through [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=184.92s)]
*  the police into the cap. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  Today is the first day of the impeachment trial, one of the most notorious figures in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  Republican State Attorney General Ken Paxton. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=198.6s)]
*  Paxton is facing 20 impeachment articles from the Republican State Senate, including [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=228.6s)]
*  corruption, misuse of public funds and abuse of public trust. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=234.76s)]
*  In many ways, Paxton is a Trump before Trump kind of figure. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Back in 2015, he was even indicted on security fraud charges, although he denies them and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=242.12s)]
*  has yet to go to trial. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Eight years later, he hasn't faced trial. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=249.16s)]
*  Back in October 2020, eight former top officials in Paxton's own office accused him of bribery [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=251.68s)]
*  and abusing his powers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=258.0s)]
*  A.G. He settled a lawsuit for more than three million dollars with those former employees. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=259.2s)]
*  And then he tried to use state funds to pay it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=263.64s)]
*  Now, a lot of Paxton's record has been in the public record for years. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=267.48s)]
*  Republicans have stuck by him until now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=272.0s)]
*  And that is the large part because, like Trump, Paxton has a keen sense for where the party [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=275.6s)]
*  base is at politically. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=280.0s)]
*  He sued the Obama and Biden administrations more than two dozen times each. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=281.96s)]
*  He also helped lead Trump's legal challenge to overturning the 2020 election. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  It's no surprise that the ex president is publicly defending Paxton, writing on social [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  media, quote, Hopefully, Republicans in the Texas House will agree is a very unfair process [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=294.36s)]
*  that should not be allowed to happen or proceed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  I will fight you if it does. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=300.8s)]
*  But Texas Republicans don't appear to be afraid of that fight. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=303.92s)]
*  I I will fight you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=307.12s)]
*  At least for now, it seems as though they really have just had enough of this guy and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  his brazen antics and they're ready to solve their Ken Paxton problem. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=312.16s)]
*  Texas state representative Jarvis Johnson is a Democrat representing Houston. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  He's a member of the Appropriations Committee, which Ken Paxton asked to cover his three [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  point three million dollar whistleblower settlement. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=323.92s)]
*  And representatives, good to have you first. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=326.48s)]
*  Just give me a read on the opening day of this, what this means for Texas politics, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=328.8s)]
*  given that Paxton is an enormously powerful and influential figure and that this is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  fundamentally a kind of Republican on Republican exercise. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=339.32s)]
*  They have supermajorities in both houses. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  Paxton's a Republican. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  They've just decided enough. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=345.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I think this is where we are, not only in this country, I think when [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=349.0s)]
*  you see an elected official that continues to use their power at some point or another. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=354.0s)]
*  The body has to then take charge. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=362.4s)]
*  And I'm so happy that the body has taken charge and decided to then indict Paxton to then go to trial for impeachment. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  And this was bipartisan support across the board. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=375.36s)]
*  There are many that want to say that all the Democrats created this and this Democrats is Democrats. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=378.72s)]
*  That's just talking points for for some groups just to simply not pay attention to what is real. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=385.16s)]
*  And that is politicians in this state are tired of elected officials taking full advantage of the office and abusing their power. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=391.44s)]
*  What we see is Paxton abuse the power so that he can further gain himself and his family and for his friends. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=402.32s)]
*  That's illegal. And so at that point, now we're going to trial. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=411.08s)]
*  And at this point, we will see. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=414.84s)]
*  I will say that when you just mentioned Donald Trump, that can be a very scary and very intimidating point that he is making. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=417.88s)]
*  That if in fact that Paxton is indicted and is kicked out of office, that you have a former president that says there will be reciprocity, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=427.8s)]
*  that there will be repercussions for their actions. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=437.72s)]
*  That's very fearful. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm very afraid of that type of mentality that can skew and slant a decision in favor of Paxton without taking into consideration all of the all of the evidence that's out there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=442.28s)]
*  And by the way, we've been placed as elected officials, as state representatives and senators to be placed under a gag order. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=458.64s)]
*  It's kind of kind of unusual and rich because at any given time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=466.16s)]
*  And the reason why we replace under gag orders is because we didn't want to unduly influence the bottom. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  And I will say that there's never in the last 10 years, I can't imagine any Democrats saying anything that would have skewed or changed the mind of any Republican when it comes to making that decision. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  We lost Jarvis Johnson, then I mean that we're totally screwed. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=496.0s)]
*  I mean, so, you know, that's the whole point. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=496.6s)]
*  So I think it's disingenuous to place that type of gag order because as an elected official, my constituents want to hear me. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=498.8s)]
*  They want to know my opinion. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=506.44s)]
*  They want to know where I stand on this. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=508.12s)]
*  But unfortunately, being placed on a gag order and then with the threat of being prosecuted kind of kind of makes me step back. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=510.0s)]
*  But I won't be silent and I won't not go before my constituents to let them know the truth and what is truly happening in this in the Senate hearing for impeachment of Paxton. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=518.92s)]
*  So my understanding is that the sort of predicate here is that he got this really sort of, I thought, very damning document by whistleblowers, people that worked for him. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=530.36s)]
*  These again, these weren't like the liberals are out to get pen, pen, packs. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  People work for him, citing different ways they felt he abused his office. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=544.16s)]
*  He settled with them. And then he went to the to the Texas state coffers to say, pay me for this settlement. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=548.16s)]
*  And my understanding is that the appropriation committee you sit on said, no, we won't. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=554.04s)]
*  And then he just used the money anyway. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=557.88s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=560.0s)]
*  Well, no, he tried. He tried. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  He tried. One of the very questions that I asked of Paxton and his team while he was sitting at the during a hearing was, do you have money in your own campaign account to pay for this? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  Why should taxpayers pay for a mistake that you personally made that you decided to make? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=577.76s)]
*  And his comments were, well, I'm an elected official. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=586.04s)]
*  And because because of that, then the the state would be responsible. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=589.76s)]
*  And of course, he didn't want to further have any more dialogue about that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=594.96s)]
*  But the opportunity was there for Paxton to to pay the money on his own campaign. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=598.6s)]
*  And I think because of because the fact he didn't pay it was the straw that broke the camel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think for many of many of the Republicans that then decided to go for impeachment, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  for an impeachment movement. And there's money there. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=618.2s)]
*  Right. We even. Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't seem outrageous to not give him the money from the state coffers to pay for his settlement with his whistleblower. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=623.64s)]
*  Texas State Representative Jarvis Johnson, who sits on the in the state assembly on the Appropriations Committee. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=635.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. State of Alabama's population is about a quarter black. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=640.08s)]
*  The state only has one majority black district out of a total of seven. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=645.6400000000001s)]
*  You can see it there highlighted in your screen in blue. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=649.44s)]
*  Now, that is so egregious that earlier this year, the six three Trump Supreme Court ruled the map violated the Voting Rights Act and that Alabama needs a second majority black district or something close to it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=652.48s)]
*  But Alabama Republicans faced with that court decision basically thumbed their nose at the court. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=665.12s)]
*  Instead, they proposed a map which slightly increased the percentage of black voters in one majority white district. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=668.64s)]
*  Well, today, a federal appeals court said no, called them out on it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=675.2s)]
*  The panel took the new maps out of the hands of the Republican state legislature and handed responsibility what's called a special master, someone appointed to draw new maps. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=679.28s)]
*  Now, the not so subtle subtext here is the struggle for national Republicans to hold the House of Representatives. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=688.0s)]
*  They fear a second majority black district in Alabama would cost Republicans a seat in Congress next election, eating into their narrow 10 seat majority. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=693.68s)]
*  Democrats only need to win five seats to flip the House. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=702.0s)]
*  Alabama could be one. Louisiana may have to add a second majority black district as well. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=705.0s)]
*  And there's the question of the indicted New York Republican George Santos running for re-election in a district that Joe Biden won fairly handily and a handful of other New York Republicans in precarious positions as well. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=710.2399999999999s)]
*  All of which is to say, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's life is likely to get significantly harder. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=721.36s)]
*  Janay Nelson is the president director counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which represented the plaintiffs in the Alabama case and argued on their behalf before the Supreme Court. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=727.76s)]
*  She joins me now. It's great to have you on the Milgin case, which this case was one of the sort of great victories for voting rights in recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=736.88s)]
*  particularly under the Voting Rights Act, which the Roberts Court has been really hostile to. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=746.76s)]
*  So they said, look, you got to draw a second black district. I mean, not to be overly reductive, but basically that right. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=751.16s)]
*  A majority black district where voters have the candidate, their choice is the language. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=757.28s)]
*  The state just didn't do that. And so now what? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=763.68s)]
*  Listen, the state of Alabama didn't just not do it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=769.56s)]
*  They boldly didn't do it. And they claimed that they would not do it despite the fact that the Supreme Court ordered them to do it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=772.5999999999999s)]
*  And frankly, that is, I think, what was the nail in the coffin for the state of Alabama when it came to the three judge panel. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=782.0s)]
*  They said that concession that Alabama was so flagrantly in violation of the Supreme Court order basically decided the case. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=789.4s)]
*  And what we have in Alabama is not just a sore loser. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=799.08s)]
*  We have a state that is engaging in subversion of a Supreme Court order. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=803.48s)]
*  That is such dangerous territory. And it's easy for us to say it's Alabama. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  This is what Alabama does. And it's not surprising. And look at the history. But we really can't normalize this. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=814.0400000000001s)]
*  This is rogue conduct is infecting our entire Congress with the taint of racial discrimination. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=819.84s)]
*  And it's something that everyone should be alarmed about. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=828.28s)]
*  Yeah. So the court says even the Roberts Court of all courts says this is flagrant violation of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=830.76s)]
*  You need to redraw the map. The state legislature tinkered a little bit, basically sent back. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=838.32s)]
*  It's like when you're if your kid is really sullen and pressing your buttons, right, like they'll like move one P on the plate. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=844.52s)]
*  And then it's like back at you. Right. Like that sort of like sort of performative disobedience. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=850.72s)]
*  Now, there's a special master who points the special master. And what is a special master going to do? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=855.56s)]
*  So the court determines who the special master will be. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=861.68s)]
*  This is a neutral and objective party who will look at all of the maps that are presented, look at all the evidence that was presented. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=864.6s)]
*  And this person is an expert in the law. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=871.88s)]
*  They understand the parameters within which they must work based on the Voting Rights Act, the Constitution, the history and doctrine from the Supreme Court. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=874.28s)]
*  And they will then draw a map that satisfies all of those constitutional principles, all of the parameters that have been established under the Voting Rights Act. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=883.24s)]
*  And they will present the court with a map that they believe meets the order of the Supreme Court and is otherwise lawful and most importantly, does not discriminate against Alabama's one point five million black voters. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=893.48s)]
*  Yeah, we should note the special masters drawing maps when there's this sort of litigation or legislatures at loggerheads is not a completely new thing. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=908.44s)]
*  In fact, there's a special mass of the group, the entire New York, drew the entire New York congressional district maps, much of the chagrin of New York Democrats who hated those maps where they got their butt kicked a little bit. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=916.2s)]
*  That is the timeline is a requirement that they do this. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=927.1600000000001s)]
*  Will the Republican legislature or state officials in Alabama try to draw this out so these maps aren't ready for the next mid next election? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=930.24s)]
*  I'm sure they will try to. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=938.36s)]
*  This is what they did with the twenty two elections. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=941.0s)]
*  We filed this lawsuit in twenty twenty one. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  As soon as this map was passed by the Alabama legislature, the legal defense fund and our plaintiffs who we've represented from the very beginning went before the court and pointed out the racial discrimination. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=945.6s)]
*  And we got an order back then. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=957.2s)]
*  We've wanted every single level of this proceeding saying that this was racial discrimination. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  The Supreme Court, unfortunately, allowed this map to stand during the twenty twenty two midterm elections. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=964.92s)]
*  But this court, this three judge court made it very clear that the special master must move forth with and that lovely arcane terminology means right away. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=971.08s)]
*  It means get this done. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=983.12s)]
*  And the court was very clear that it wanted this map in place before the twenty twenty four elections. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=984.72s)]
*  Otherwise, we would have black voters being disenfranchised and frankly, all of our Alabama voters being disenfranchised based on a discriminatory map in yet another very important congressional election cycle. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=989.64s)]
*  There's been similar concerns expressed and litigation around Louisiana map that the Louisiana map does something similar and the Florida map. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1003.28s)]
*  In fact, the Florida map was a map that was so aggressive that it was more aggressive than what the state Republican Party in the legislature had drawn. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1011.32s)]
*  So do you does this end with Alabama? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1021.12s)]
*  Absolutely not. Let me tell you, there's any number of cases that could have gone to the Supreme Court and gotten the same ruling that Milligan did out of Alabama. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1025.48s)]
*  There are egregious racial gerrymanders throughout this country. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1033.8400000000001s)]
*  We are filing a brief today in the Fifth Circuit in the Louisiana congressional redistricting case. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1037.72s)]
*  We will be arguing before the Supreme Court in October on the South Carolina redistricting case. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1044.32s)]
*  There was just a win last week in Florida because of its congressional redistricting and on and on Georgia. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1049.6s)]
*  I mean, I could go on about the egregious racial gerrymandering that is infecting our Congress and creating the imbalance that so many people are dismayed about. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1056.28s)]
*  Janay Nelson, thank you so much for time tonight. Appreciate it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LJaBmaBwo&t=1068.6799999999998s)]
