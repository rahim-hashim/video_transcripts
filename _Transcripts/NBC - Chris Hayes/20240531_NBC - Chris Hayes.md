# ‘Unrepentant’ Trump may face prison time after guilty verdict, legal experts say
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc)
*  Christy Greenberg is the former deputy chief of the criminal division for the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=0.0s)]
*  Donya Perry also serves as a prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, and she represented Michael Cohn during this trial, and they join me now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=5.14s)]
*  I want to start with you, Donya, in sort of both of those roles that we had you on last night as Michael Cohn's attorney, and obviously you know these criminal justice systems very well. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=12.44s)]
*  We're going back and forth today internally on whether the gag order is still in effect. Do you know if it is or not? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=20.04s)]
*  Great question. Michael called me today and he said, I think Trump just violated the gag order. He's calling me a sleazeball and all manner of things. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=27.9s)]
*  And I had to look it up. It seems that Justice Marchand has not lifted it, so it is still in place and will remain so until either he loses jurisdiction on appeal or he lifts it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=35.14s)]
*  So that's your understanding. That it is. Because he clearly was attacking Michael Cohn as one of the witnesses. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  Now there's some people say the gag order is there to preserve the integrity of the trial. The trial is over, so maybe it's gone. But your understanding is that it's still in effect. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=52.7s)]
*  I had thought that was the purpose was you don't want to infect the jurors or the jury pool before they're impaneled. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  You don't want to intimidate the witnesses. So in some logical way, you think, well, it's done when the trial is done. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  But no, there still is a sentencing. There still is this maybe just like a penumbra or cloud that still hangs over. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=75.9s)]
*  I mean, I think that there's passions are inflamed for sure. Anger around the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=85.06s)]
*  And so I know personally from Michael's experience and even derivative from my own that there is a tremendous amount of rancor, to say the least, out there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=91.5s)]
*  That is still directed at the trial witnesses and no doubt at the jurors were they to their anonymity to to be lost, which that will remain in place, of course. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=103.1s)]
*  Yes, although there were some reporting today of certain message boards that are fans of the former president attempting to dox them and trying to get people to go after them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=113.58s)]
*  Let's talk brass tacks here, Kristi, on the what happens next. So a lot of questions about sentencing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess the first question is, OK, so we're going to that sentencing on July 11th might get pushed back a little bit, but it's probably going to happen sometime this summer. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=128.82s)]
*  What do you think's reasonable? Just level set for us if you were working in that office to ask for or for a judge to grant for a sentence? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=138.14s)]
*  Well, the first thing they're going to do is look at what probation recommends in their report, which is, I mean, that's going to happen probably in the next few weeks that he's going to sit down with a probation officer. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=147.14s)]
*  Yes, presumably in New York. Yes. Sitting there next to the Secret Service. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=157.42s)]
*  I mean, so with the PO there, right. And the PO is saying, so where were you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=162.14s)]
*  What was your last job? I mean, right. I'm not even I'm not I'm doing a bit, but that's what's going to happen. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=167.18s)]
*  Yes. They will go through all of their standard questions, though, again, so much of it is public knowledge with him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=172.54s)]
*  So maybe a bit redundant, but they will go through that process with him and then they will come up with their recommendation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  The parties will both get a copy of that report. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=184.22s)]
*  Generally, that report is not made public, though you will see snippets of that report in both of the briefings from either side when they quote to that report. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=186.26s)]
*  And the report will generate a recommendation. Yes. Like a top line like four months or no or time served or home confinement or whatever. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=193.9s)]
*  Yes. I mean, that that's typically what you see. That's what the that's the basic text. That's the template. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=201.34s)]
*  Yes. And so, again, but neither party is, you know, neither party needs to follow that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=207.22s)]
*  But generally, the court does give that a fair amount of weight because they tend to be more neutral. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=212.66s)]
*  So both parties will look at that. They will then decide, look, I think in this circumstance, I mean, in terms of thinking of what a fair sentence here would be, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=218.66s)]
*  one thing that you look at, one factor is relative culpability. Right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=226.74s)]
*  So Michael Cohen has already been sentenced for the same thing, and he was sentenced to three years in prison. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=231.14s)]
*  Now, granted, he was also sentenced for other crimes and not just this one. Right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=236.66s)]
*  However, that was part of the sentence. And during that sentence, Judge Pauli said that, you know, I'm paraphrasing here, but, you know, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  that those campaign finance violations were a danger to democracy and they were serious enough for him to use that kind of language. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  And we heard that same language in the closing here where Joshua Stein glass said, you know, you heard from Todd Blanch that, you know, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=254.86s)]
*  just influencing an election that conspiring to do that, that's democracy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=263.1s)]
*  No, this was subversion of democracy. Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=268.02000000000004s)]
*  We need the electorate to be informed, to have access to accurate information. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=270.86s)]
*  And this was an attempt to defraud the voters. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=274.98s)]
*  And so when you have that same language mirroring in a sentence of someone who is, I think, admittedly less culpable than the person he was doing this at the direction of, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=277.74s)]
*  it's hard to see how the prosecutors would not ask for prison here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=287.66s)]
*  What do you think? And I just add in, yeah, another thing the judge looks at is comparators. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=291.86s)]
*  So they look at other sentences that other like defendants have received, not just in this case, Michael Cohen, as you say, but other defendants who've been convicted. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=296.66s)]
*  Defrauding business records and I looked at this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=306.5s)]
*  I co-authored a white paper for the Brookings Institution and we looked at hundreds of other sentence coming out of New York, coming out of New York for the exact same crime and always with a bump up to a felony in this case. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=310.1s)]
*  And people get prison terms, not just, you know, even first time offenders, even, you know, for that, for the same type of crime, they will get a prison term. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=324.46s)]
*  In this case, we have someone who subverted an election as the jury found and also has not only been unrepentant, of course, you know, he didn't plead guilty to this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=336.14s)]
*  He was convicted, but he has constantly thumbed his nose at this judge in the system and has been contemptuous. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I personally, I my my feelings about prisoner, you know, I think we wildly over incarcerate. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  We have wildly too long sentences. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=361.18s)]
*  We have far fewer people and the American sentencing system is pretty messed up. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=362.66s)]
*  So my desire to see them go to prisoner jail is zero. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=366.74s)]
*  I will say it's interesting that you note that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=370.46s)]
*  And I've been seeing this cavalcade of rich men, generally Elon Musk and others being like, can you imagine? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=372.98s)]
*  I mean, this is nuts. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=379.38s)]
*  Someone going to jail for this? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=380.58s)]
*  It's like, yeah, dude, like, no, it actually does happen. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=382.02s)]
*  I hate to break it to you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  Kristi Greenberg, Dona Perry. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=386.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_kP_arlCc&t=388.26s)]
