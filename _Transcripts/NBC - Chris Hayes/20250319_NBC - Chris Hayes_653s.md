# 'Now is the time to break glass’: Chris Hayes reacts to Schumer interview
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The movement to resist Donald Trump's unconstitutional power grab faces two fundamental questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=0.0s)]
*  How bad are things right now? And when is it time to use every possible democratic means to slow his assault? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=9.0s)]
*  Last night I had Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on this program, and the interview was clarifying in many ways. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=16.0s)]
*  But one of my main takeaways from it is that there's a fundamental difference between how some people view this moment and how others do. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=23.0s)]
*  I think some people think we are in a constitutional crisis, that there is a plan in place to impose a dictatorship on this country that is being executed as we speak. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=30.0s)]
*  And Senator Schumer does not think we are quite there yet. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=42.0s)]
*  If democracy is at risk, that's a little different than what we're talking about now. Even a shutdown as horrible as it is, we'll all have to stand up and fight back in every way. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=47.0s)]
*  I think actually this is useful because I do think, just in a genuine sort of good faith way, that there's a lot of people, and I think I probably count myself among them, who think that that's where we are right now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=56.0s)]
*  That the plan being deployed right now... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=68.0s)]
*  You may be right. I don't think so. We're there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=71.0s)]
*  You think we're not there yet. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=73.0s)]
*  I think we're getting there, and we have to be really vigilant. I just had a meeting today with the Judiciary Committee to decide how we're working through this as it goes further. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=75.0s)]
*  It hasn't been up to the Supreme Court yet, which would be the classic if they disobey the Supreme Court. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=82.0s)]
*  We're on our way there, God forbid, but I think we are, and we'll have to go at it and at it and at it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=87.0s)]
*  And that is different than anything else. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=94.0s)]
*  Different than anything else. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=98.0s)]
*  Quantum leap different because our democracy is then 248 years of American democracy, the Magna Carta is out the window, and we will all have to take extraordinary action. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=100.0s)]
*  I got to say, I genuinely hope that Schumer's read on this is correct, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=112.0s)]
*  But it makes it very hard to imagine a leader meeting the moment if they don't believe the moment is here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=117.0s)]
*  I mean, for me, Donald Trump's intentions are really very clear at this point. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=123.0s)]
*  He is in the process of attempting to undo the Constitutional Republic. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=128.0s)]
*  His executive branch is in the process of overtaking of reducing to subservience the legislative and judicial branches of the government, Congress and the courts so that he can act unilaterally. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=133.0s)]
*  Even within his executive purview, the president is purging anything, anyone that falls short of pledging unshakable loyal to him personally and his personal political project, not the United States, not the Constitution and not we the people. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=147.0s)]
*  I mean, from the FBI to the Department of Justice to the Federal Trade Commission and on and on and on. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=161.0s)]
*  These institutions day after day are being cleared of officials, career officials who may favor the rule of law over Trump's wins, and they are being replaced with loyalists all in open, flagrant violation of the law, like clearly illegal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=166.0s)]
*  As the New York Times reports, Trump is using the vast powers of the presidency to hobble his political opponents as well, including bogus investigations into Democratic fundraising platforms, threats to shut down nonprofit organizations he sees as oppositional. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=181.0s)]
*  And it's not just the government or partisan entities. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=196.0s)]
*  Trump wants to dismantle all forms of public opposition to his power graph, starting with all sources of independent authority. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=199.0s)]
*  Any institution with credible credibility must either be bent to trim Trump's winner destroyed. That's the goal here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=208.0s)]
*  I mean, again, he says this every day. He's repeatedly threatened independent media outlets, including this one for coverage he deems to be insufficiently fawning. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=214.0s)]
*  He said that he thinks it's illegal that people should be in jail. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=223.0s)]
*  He is currently conducting an unprecedented attack on American higher education, including just today, freezing $175 million in federal funding to his own alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=226.0s)]
*  He's openly defying the Constitution. He tries to deport illegal residents for his protected political speech. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=238.0s)]
*  This is it, man. This is he's trying it. I'm not saying he's being successful. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=246.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that, you know, all is lost and they're going to win and, you know, doom and gloom, but they're trying to do it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=250.0s)]
*  They're trying to get rid of independent voices of authority, purge them, fracture a pluralistic civil society. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=261.0s)]
*  It's clear as day to so many of us, including, I will say, scholars of authoritarian regimes and especially this is pretty important. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=271.0s)]
*  Lots of folks who have lived through these regimes like people that have been in dictatorships in Latin America or recently in Hungary or in Turkey or in Russia. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=279.0s)]
*  Listen to them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=288.0s)]
*  And part of the issue, I think, right now, particularly with Democratic leadership and the role they're playing in Democratic elected politicians, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=292.0s)]
*  Stems from a legitimate concern, which ties to how we got to this point. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=300.0s)]
*  As we heard last night, there's a sense among Democrats, one that is not totally wrong and sort of based in some of the data that democracy itself, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=306.0s)]
*  Preserving the constitutional order is just not a particularly salient political issue, particularly for people that are not super, super paying attention. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=314.0s)]
*  And that's based on the fact that Democrats did spend a lot of the 2024 election cycle hammering their messaging about threats to democracy and civil society. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=323.0s)]
*  And then they lost the election ultimately because voters, particularly those voters sort of on the most margins of paying attention to politics and news were most concerned about popular issues, specifically the high cost of living, which is what they told every pollster. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=332.0s)]
*  And so because of that, I think a lot of Democrats in power and political consultants around the Democratic Party have come to conclude that democracy is a losing issue politically. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=347.0s)]
*  And we should they should talk about Medicaid cuts, for instance, instead. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=360.0s)]
*  Every day we are hammering away at Trump. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=366.0s)]
*  And we have a simple, simple thought that unites the Democratic Party from one end to the other. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=370.0s)]
*  He's asking the middle class to pay for tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=375.0s)]
*  It unites us all. Bernie Sanders likes it. My most conservative members like it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=380.0s)]
*  We're hammering away at that. Today it was Medicaid. Tomorrow it's going to be in the next few days going to be tariffs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=384.0s)]
*  He's raising those tariffs, raising your costs, Mr. And Mrs. American, by $2,000 a year if he raises all these tariffs so that he can use that money for tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=389.0s)]
*  He's cutting your education funds and so your kids don't get a great education and your school taxes will go up for that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=399.0s)]
*  Now, don't get me wrong. I think that's good and clear messaging. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=405.0s)]
*  And we do a lot of coverage of the economic dynamics and destruction of Trump here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=409.0s)]
*  I understand the instinct to stick to kitchen table issues. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=415.0s)]
*  I don't think it's necessarily the wrong lesson to have learned from the election. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=419.0s)]
*  But again, the terrain has shifted too much since November 2024. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=422.0s)]
*  And I do fear Democrats are kind of caught fighting the last war. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=427.0s)]
*  All of those things you enumerated, which all sound like good politics to me, are the kinds of things that you'd be doing if Mitt Romney were president. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=432.0s)]
*  That like there's this weird asymmetry right now, which is that they are acting in this totally new way in which they are ambitiously trying to seize all power and create a new world. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=442.0s)]
*  They're trying to take all power and create a presidential dictatorship in the United States of America. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=451.0s)]
*  And the Democratic opposition is acting like, well, if we can get their pool rate down a few points, then what happens? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=455.0s)]
*  Well, what happens is, look, first we get it way down. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=462.0s)]
*  He's going to have much less. This worked in 2017. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=465.0s)]
*  We say now it's a different government. It's different, though. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=468.0s)]
*  Oh, it is different. But health care, we beat him. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=471.0s)]
*  Taxes, we beat him. And guess what we did? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=474.0s)]
*  Guess what we did, Chris? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=476.0s)]
*  We took back the House and won in the Senate and then we were allowed to do all those good things. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=477.0s)]
*  Again, Senator Schumer understands political strategy and he's right about that history. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=482.0s)]
*  And he's right that that type of resistance did work eight years ago. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=487.0s)]
*  And in many ways, you know, that first Trump administration, politically, was a failure. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=490.0s)]
*  I mean, it got a huge tax cut to billionaires. Surprise, surprise, and corporations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=494.0s)]
*  But again, it just when you are paying as close attention as we are here on this program, here at the network, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=499.0s)]
*  and I think a lot of you watching at home, it just does seem that now is the time for. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=506.0s)]
*  It's a break class, right? It's not the time for politics as usual. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=512.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, Trump is already underwater for the first time in his career on the question of the economy, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=516.0s)]
*  which is interesting and I think welcome news both for Democrats and those opposed to what he's doing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=520.0s)]
*  I mean, the state of the stock market amid Trump's trade war is doing a pretty good job messaging pocketbook issues itself, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=525.0s)]
*  along with the terrorists that are coming April 2nd. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=531.0s)]
*  But more importantly, I would say you don't have to choose. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=534.0s)]
*  I strongly believe this. It's all one thing. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=538.0s)]
*  It's all one thing. The threat to democracy has become so much more tangible than it was when folks went to the ballot four months ago, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=543.0s)]
*  in part because this entire Mad King Act is wreaking havoc in every direction. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=550.0s)]
*  And with that in mind, a lot of leader Schumer's Democratic colleagues believe it's time to basically fight back harder as Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been out there saying. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=557.0s)]
*  This moment requires us to break norms. This moment requires us to take risks. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=567.0s)]
*  And I get it. A lot of my colleagues said shutting down the government, being in a government shutdown, that's a risk. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=572.0s)]
*  That hands power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But how on earth are we going to ask the American people to take risks for us? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=578.0s)]
*  Right. When there's a five alarm constitutional fire and we need them to be out on the streets, not with hundreds, not with thousands or tens of thousands of people, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=585.0s)]
*  but with hundreds of thousands of people, if we're not willing to show courage and take risks or so. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=592.0s)]
*  He's right. Hundreds of thousands of people. That's what it's going to take. Honestly. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=597.0s)]
*  I think now is the time to take political risks before it's too late. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=602.0s)]
*  I mean, to only barely slightly oversimplify, the whole point of America is that you cannot have one guy in charge of everything without checks or balances. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=604.0s)]
*  It is literally the foundational insight upon which this country was built. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=617.0s)]
*  No kings. Not ever. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=623.0s)]
*  There is quite possibly nothing that is more fundamentally American. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=626.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYiaifdIJIk&t=634.0s)]
