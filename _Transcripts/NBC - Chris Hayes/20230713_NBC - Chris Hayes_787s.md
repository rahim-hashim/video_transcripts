# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 13
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U)
*  Earlier this week, we brought you the story of House Oversight Committee Chairman James [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=0.0s)]
*  Comer's missing informant in his ongoing effort to bring down the so-called Biden crime family. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=5.68s)]
*  This is the man who, according to Comer, has key evidence about President Joe Biden and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=12.0s)]
*  his family taking bribes from China. His name is Gal Luft. He is a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  who heads a think tank in the Washington, D.C. area. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  As we just learned, Luft has been indicted by the U.S. government and is actually on the lam right now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=25.56s)]
*  In February, he was arrested in the Republic of Cyprus, but he fled while on bail. Luft faces [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=32.44s)]
*  eight counts for arms trafficking, violating Iranian sanctions, and, according to prosecutors, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=38.6s)]
*  being an agent of the Chinese government. Now, Democratic members of Congress are calling for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=43.8s)]
*  an investigation into whether James Comer's Oversight Committee has been manipulated by a foreign [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=48.68s)]
*  power. One of those Democratic members is Congressman Dan Goldman of New York, who joins me now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=54.6s)]
*  Congressman, what do you make of all this? It's like a bad spy novel where you have an actual spy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=60.6s)]
*  who's on the run facing federal charges of very serious nature, including being a spy for China, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=70.44s)]
*  who then decides, oh, wait, maybe I can defend myself against these charges by [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=79.0s)]
*  laundering information through an official committee of Congress. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=84.68s)]
*  And then, of course, you have the desperate Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=88.6s)]
*  who will do anything to get any information that might be able to damage President Biden, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=92.84s)]
*  and they welcome this unverified, uncorroborated information from a fugitive, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  charged criminal. It's truly remarkable that this is the star witness that the House Republicans [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=105.64s)]
*  are trying to rely on in their effort to attack and undermine President Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=112.92s)]
*  And one other thing, Chris, which you didn't mention, he is charged with making false statements [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  to the FBI. So he's not remotely credible based on the indictment alone. And he made those false [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  statements in the same meeting that he discussed Hunter Biden with the FBI, which is the information [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=132.28s)]
*  that Chairman Comer wants to get. I didn't realize that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=139.72s)]
*  All right. Well, here's my play, Kevin McCarthy, Kevin McCarthy's reaction to this. And I want to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=147.16s)]
*  get your reaction to what Kevin McCarthy said. Take a listen. No, it wouldn't undermine the case [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=151.4s)]
*  because if you extrapolate that even further, the Justice Department went after him. Well, Hunter [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=156.68s)]
*  Biden received more money from the same foreign CEFC company that this informant did, much more. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=165.32s)]
*  So it only made the case stronger that the government really didn't look into Hunter Biden. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  So the indictment of the key informant makes the case against Hunter Biden stronger. What do you think? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=181.08s)]
*  I still cannot understand the rationale behind that argument is the idea that because the same [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=187.0s)]
*  company paid these two people that therefore Hunter Biden is an arms dealer and lied to the FBI [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=193.96s)]
*  and is an unregistered agent of China. It makes absolutely no sense. But it really does show, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=201.96s)]
*  Chris, the desperation that House Republicans are feeling right now because one after another, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  of their investigations are crumbling under the own weight of their unfounded and baseless [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  allegations that they do not have evidence for. And that is ultimately what they're running into. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  What reminds me, it's like if you put word out on the street that you will take dirt on Biden from [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=228.28s)]
*  all comers, it's like flypaper for all sorts of characters. And it reminds me of what happened in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=233.64s)]
*  the impeachment over Ukraine, which you were involved in as a staff counsel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=238.2s)]
*  There's all kinds of very shady characters coming forward to give Giuliani and others these lines [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=244.28s)]
*  that are what they want to hear. And then if you scratch the surface a little, it's like [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=250.92s)]
*  these are not people that are trustworthy. No, not at all. And this one in particular [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=254.83999999999997s)]
*  recognized that his criminal defense could be bolstered by using the House Oversight Committee. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=260.44s)]
*  He even stated to the New York Post that his whistleblowing to the Oversight Committee [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=266.36s)]
*  is why the Department of Justice is going after him. He was indicted months ago before they even [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=274.68s)]
*  knew who he was. So these whistleblowers recognize that they have a good defense [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=279.8s)]
*  mechanism in the House Republicans who will take any and all information without any corroboration, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=287.32s)]
*  without any verification, and then just extrapolate beyond all reason. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=294.36s)]
*  One of the things that you're calling for, this is the letter that you endorsed, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  there's a select committee on the CCP now, the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=304.76s)]
*  which I have mixed feelings about just as a side note. But their letter to that committee, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=309.64s)]
*  letter from Jared Moskowitz, enabling a Chinese backed Iranian arms supplier and making him a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=313.88s)]
*  centerpiece of the Oversight Investigations, calls into question whether the CCP has tainted [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=320.52s)]
*  the Oversight Committee and its work. You want that committee to look into the Oversight Committee's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=324.52s)]
*  use of this guy? Well, certainly Chairman Comer is not going to do any deep dive to figure out [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  whether this guy is compromised and is peddling information on behalf of China that might undermine [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=334.84s)]
*  our national security. And if we are going to have a select committee on the CCP, as you say, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  with some misgivings, then they ought to make sure that the Chinese government is not infiltrating [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=348.2s)]
*  this body itself and potentially trying to launder information through an official committee of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=354.76s)]
*  Congress to undermine our national security. We don't even know the extent of China's involvement [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=362.2s)]
*  with this individual. We just know that he's been charged as an unregistered agent advancing the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=369.4s)]
*  interests of the Chinese government. And that is incredibly dangerous to have as a witness [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=375.96s)]
*  before an official committee. Final question for you about the vote today in the House. There's a [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=381.96s)]
*  vote today. There's a Pentagon policy post the overturning of Roe v. Wade that pays for paid [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=387.0s)]
*  leave for service members that need to leave where they are if they're in a state that where they [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  don't have access to abortion to go secure an abortion and return. That policy has been the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=398.76s)]
*  reason that Tommy Tuberville is holding up all high level nominations to the Pentagon. And today [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=404.36s)]
*  the House voted to overturn that Pentagon policy. And I what do you think? Are you surprised they [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=409.56s)]
*  keep at this given the political blowback they have already faced and given this is essentially [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  a symbolic vote? It's not going to go anywhere in the Senate. Yeah, it's truly remarkable that they [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  continue their attack on the individual freedoms of Americans, both with this amendment effectively [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=432.12s)]
*  banning any abortion for military service members who have to seek an abortion from a different state [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=439.4s)]
*  as well as undermining and attacking the LGBTQ community by banning any support for gender [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=447.24s)]
*  affirming care to allow people to live a life that they want to live. This is the Republican [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  Party attacking our individual freedoms across the board. But I am a little surprised. And I'll tell [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  you, I come from New York where there are, as you know, because you live there, a number of very close [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=468.12s)]
*  purple district House seats. New York is robustly in support of reproductive rights and the right to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=474.2s)]
*  abortion. And all of the Republican members voted to restrict abortion access for members in the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=481.72s)]
*  military. And you can bet that we will be bringing that up from now until November 2024. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=490.04s)]
*  Every day we show you some new climate data point that is crazier than the last. Well, here's today's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=498.92s)]
*  edition. The water temperature off the coast of Florida yesterday spiked above 98 degrees. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=503.96s)]
*  Ocean water, 98 degrees. Also in Florida, you might recall that yesterday we told you [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  farmers insurance is now the fourth home insured to flee the state due largely to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=517.72s)]
*  increased climate risk. And according to industry numbers, the average home insurance premium in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=522.92s)]
*  Florida is 42% higher than last year and miles ahead of the average premium nationwide. Now, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=527.8s)]
*  there's some local market reasons for that. But the main reason for this is simply climate [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=534.28s)]
*  disasters keep ravaging the state at a markedly increased clip, making it just too expensive to [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=539.4s)]
*  operate there. Of course, Republicans like Governor Ron DeSantis, his administration and members of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  the Florida congressional delegation are calling the problem a liberal agenda, ignoring the numbers, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=549.0s)]
*  attacking everyone from insurance companies, following their business interests to President [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=553.4s)]
*  Joe Biden's point person on climate change. That person, presidential envoy for climate, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=557.16s)]
*  John Kerry's on Capitol Hill today being shouted out as an avatar of the radical woke mob as the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=561.88s)]
*  ocean off Florida approaches sous vide levels. You can't worry about the efficiency of your home. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=567.4s)]
*  If you can't make rent, if you can't make your war, your mortgage payment, and you can't [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=574.36s)]
*  worry about the emissions of your automobile payment of your automobile, if you can't make the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=578.28s)]
*  payment on your car, I believe that you are representing a far left radical agenda. Those [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=583.4s)]
*  are my beliefs. Elizabeth Colbert is a staff writer for New Yorker who has covered climate [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=589.48s)]
*  change for decades. She's also author of Under a White Sky, the nature of the future. And she [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=595.32s)]
*  joins me now. Elizabeth, great to have you on. I'm such an admirer of your writing for many years [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=600.76s)]
*  on this topic. And I thought of you as we keep having one data point after another, someone who's [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=605.48s)]
*  chronicled this written about the implications for a long time, just what you're thinking and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=610.44s)]
*  feeling as you see this play out right now. Well, it's a sort of sickening feeling, I have to say, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, and I think that it's probably shared. I also sort of seized on that. Those figures out [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=622.6s)]
*  of Florida, which are just absolutely, you know, I guess, paradoxically chilling. I think a lot of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=630.2s)]
*  scientists are looking at this spike in sea service temperatures as among the most worrying [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=635.96s)]
*  signs that you could have. Scientists, you know, as you and I have discussed over the years, have [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=641.88s)]
*  been warning us about this for a really long time. You know, with the first report on climate change, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=650.84s)]
*  the dangers of climate change landed on President Johnson's desk in 1965. And now we're watching [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=656.84s)]
*  everything that climate scientists predicted come true. And the thing that is, I think, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=663.08s)]
*  so frightening about it all is, you know, not just what is happening, but what this portends. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  There are all these sort of cascading effects in your book about extinction and the ecosystem [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=680.44s)]
*  effects of this climate change. I mean, one of the things I was seeing was coral bleaching and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=686.5200000000001s)]
*  coral, which is obviously a huge part of the ocean ecosystem. It has to be at a certain pretty [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=690.84s)]
*  narrow band of temperatures. So this poses a threat to that. I mean, I can't even compute [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=695.96s)]
*  the cascading effects of all this. We think about the humans, but obviously it's playing [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=701.0s)]
*  throughout the entire ecosystems and particularly in the ocean. Yeah. And I think that the effects [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=705.64s)]
*  that you're going to see with warming oceans are going to be, you know, immense. And scientists [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=713.0s)]
*  make the point that the planet should have been called ocean. 70% of our planet is covered by [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=719.48s)]
*  ocean. And when you warm up the oceans, you change a lot of the parameters that are crucial to marine [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=724.84s)]
*  life and will have ramifications for the weather on land. Absolutely. Very serious ones. But for [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=732.28s)]
*  example, one thing that you're doing, you know, warm water simply holds less oxygen than cold [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=737.96s)]
*  water. So you're going to get these tremendous dead zones where pretty much nothing can live. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=743.64s)]
*  And you're getting this stratification of the oceans as well, where you're not going to get [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=749.16s)]
*  upwelling of nutrients, which a lot of creatures need in the ocean. So you're going to get, as you [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=753.8s)]
*  pointed out, these cascading effects, and we are already seeing some of them, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=759.48s)]
*  and we're going to see more of them and coral. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFWF1hg019U&t=764.28s)]
