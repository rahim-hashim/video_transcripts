# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Oct. 13
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w)
*  NBC News foreign correspondent Josh Letterman joins us now from the northern coast of Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=0.0s)]
*  in the city of Nahariya. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=6.32s)]
*  Josh, what are you hearing today as the mobilization seems to be nearing the beginning of some [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=8.22s)]
*  kind of ground offensive? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=15.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Chris. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=17.34s)]
*  We're about three hours past that 24-hour deadline that you just described for those [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  1.1 million people in the northern Gaza Strip to get to the south. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  And I think a lot of people both in Israel and in the Gaza Strip are really bracing for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=29.48s)]
*  a major ground incursion to potentially start when the clock struck midnight here in Israel [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=33.68s)]
*  and in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  So far, we haven't seen any signs that that major ground incursion has yet begun. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=41.52s)]
*  But we did hear from Israel's military that for the very first time that we know about [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=46.92s)]
*  since the terror attacks of Saturday, Israeli ground troops conducted raids into the Gaza [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=51.6s)]
*  Strip, where they went into Gaza to not only try to wipe out Hamas terrorists and seize [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=58.34s)]
*  weapons but also, according to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, to search for evidence [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=65.7s)]
*  that could help them ultimately free the hostages that are located there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=71.5s)]
*  As far as we know, they didn't manage to get any hostages out during this one incursion. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  It does seem to suggest that Israel is building up very quickly towards a much larger offensive [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=81.72s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip as the humanitarian situation, as you described, is really just getting worse [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=88.72s)]
*  and worse. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=94.2s)]
*  In fact, we learned that as those civilians are trying to evacuate to the south, some [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=95.2s)]
*  70 or so of them were killed today in three convoys that were heading south by Israeli [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  airstrikes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=107.16s)]
*  That's according not only to Palestinian health officials but also to local witnesses that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=108.16s)]
*  NBC News was able to speak to within the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  And there are real concerns tonight within Israel that this crisis could soon start to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=117.24s)]
*  expand beyond the Gaza Strip to the other fronts that Israel has to deal with, most [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=122.14s)]
*  notably up where I am in northern Israel along the border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah made [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=127.46s)]
*  clear today that they do not plan to sit this out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=134.5s)]
*  They have been fairly restrained compared to what we've seen many times in the past. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=137.54s)]
*  There have been some skirmishes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military over the last couple [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=142.74s)]
*  of days. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=146.54s)]
*  But the leaders making clear that at some point they do plan to get involved. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=147.54s)]
*  And that has people in the community where I'm at, Nahariya and other areas along this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=151.14s)]
*  border, very concerned, anxious, walking the streets, feeling like this is the calm before [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  the storm. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=161.82s)]
*  And they are worried that just like rockets have been falling daily into southern Israel [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=162.82s)]
*  near the Gaza Strip, that they will also be facing that kind of rocket attacks here in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=167.26s)]
*  northern Israel, Chris. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=171.66s)]
*  Josh, yes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=173.18s)]
*  I mean, I want to just follow up on that because I saw some reports today about exchanges of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=174.18s)]
*  fire. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=180.02s)]
*  There's a Reuters cameraman who was killed in southern Lebanon where he was covering [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=181.02s)]
*  this earlier today. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=185.26s)]
*  Is there, are the Hezbollah rockets more advanced, less advanced, or about the same as what Hamas [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=188.58s)]
*  has been firing from Gaza and does Iron Dome, which is the sort of infamous system that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  has been able to shoot those rockets down, rather effectively function as well in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=198.18s)]
*  north? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=203.38000000000002s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  So one thing to remember is that both Hamas and Hezbollah get a lot of support from Iran, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  a country that has a very advanced missile system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=213.9s)]
*  So in both of these countries, it's not simply pedestrians who are making their own rockets [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=216.22s)]
*  out of whatever they can find. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=221.94s)]
*  They have training, they have support, they have supplies being brought in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=223.02s)]
*  That having been said, Hezbollah is known to have longer term rockets. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=226.38s)]
*  And in fact, the air defense system here in the north, it's a layered air defense system, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=229.98s)]
*  but they have a special program in place really to address rockets that are of the longer [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=234.7s)]
*  range, somewhere in the 60 to 100 mile range. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  And so they really are acutely aware of that threat from those longer range rockets that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=244.94000000000003s)]
*  could reach deeper into Israel because of the capabilities that Hezbollah has amassed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=250.3s)]
*  over the years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  Summer Lee is a Democrat of Pennsylvania, and she joins me now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  Congressman, I wonder how this looks from the Democratic side of the aisle. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=260.62s)]
*  I mean, you guys, it's like, I remember talking to friends of mine who were writers during [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=263.94s)]
*  the writer's strike, and they were like, well, I mean, you know, we can't work and kind of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  want to, but we're... [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=270.62s)]
*  You guys are on like a weird, enforced no work period until they figure this out, I guess? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=271.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's like pure chaos. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=279.5s)]
*  And honestly, it's shameful and it's ridiculous at this point. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  We come back in the midst of all that we have happening and we're sitting here since Tuesday [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=285.46s)]
*  night, we've not seen the House floor. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=291.5s)]
*  We've not seen a committee room. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=294.42s)]
*  We've not passed a bill. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=296.02s)]
*  We're 35 days from another budget crisis, and we are doing this every day, day in and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=297.46s)]
*  day out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=304.58s)]
*  So I think it reflects incredibly poorly on the Republican conference, on their leadership [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=305.58s)]
*  ability. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  And honestly, frankly, from I think our perspective, we recognize that there is no qualified candidate [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  that they're able to produce anyways. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  So we sit in the wings waiting with our own caucus ready to lead and ready to go. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=318.38s)]
*  Yeah, just the math here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=323.46s)]
*  You saw how Kapur laid this out earlier. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=325.06s)]
*  They threw McCarthy overboard. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=326.82s)]
*  He had 210 votes in the House Majority Speaker. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=327.82s)]
*  Then they picked Scalise who had 113. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=330.46s)]
*  Again, internally, he withdrew. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=332.14s)]
*  Now they nominated Jordan who on the second vote got 124. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=334.38s)]
*  The number to win is 217. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=338.5s)]
*  Like they're still pretty far. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=340.38s)]
*  I guess my question to you is, there is talk about... [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=343.9s)]
*  There has been the case in some state houses, similar dysfunction in which Democrats have [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=350.02s)]
*  actually cut a deal with some faction of a Republican majority to elect a speaker. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=354.74s)]
*  Is that a discussion Democrats are having? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=361.18s)]
*  Can you imagine a world in which that did happen? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=363.02s)]
*  You know, I can say that I've not been and no one who I've served in caucus with are [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=367.38s)]
*  a part of those type of discussions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=373.62s)]
*  I would be really surprised if the Republicans would humble themselves in any way to accept [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=375.1s)]
*  the deal from the Democrats. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=379.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=380.94s)]
*  We're a caucus of calm. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=381.98s)]
*  We're the caucus that would prove that this was their moment. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=383.66s)]
*  They regained the majority. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=387.14s)]
*  They were supposed to sail in, cruise in, and do everything that they wanted to do. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=389.58s)]
*  It has been an utter disaster from day one. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=394.34s)]
*  So it would take a level of self-awareness close to Scalise stepping down, but a little [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=396.94s)]
*  bit even more than that for them to accept Hawking Jefferies as a co-leader or anything [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=402.06s)]
*  close to that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=407.42s)]
*  Sheer power is still within the realm. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=408.86s)]
*  That's what we're pushing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  That's what I know progressives are making sure that we want them to recognize that we [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=412.85999999999996s)]
*  can have sheer power agreements so that we can un-stall the government. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=416.7s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  We just want the government to work again and we want to be able to get a budget done. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=421.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the sheer power. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=424.94s)]
*  I mean, I saw people floating various, you know, things. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=426.3s)]
*  I mean, the thing to remember here is the caucus math is different than the House math. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=429.14s)]
*  It's 217. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=432.7s)]
*  That's a vote in the House. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=433.7s)]
*  That's a constitutional office. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=434.7s)]
*  It's not a party vote. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=436.14s)]
*  It's a vote in the House. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=437.14s)]
*  2017, I want to just play what Hawking Jefferies today had to say in response to your colleague [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=438.14s)]
*  Jim Jordan being nominated by the Internal Republican Caucus for speaker before they [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=443.9s)]
*  all went home. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=448.26s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=449.26s)]
*  House Republicans have just elected a speaker nominee who in 16 years in this Congress hasn't [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=450.26s)]
*  single bill because his focus has not been on the American people. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=462.02s)]
*  His focus has been on peddling lies and conspiracy theories and driving division amongst the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=469.46s)]
*  American people. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=478.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't think it's going to happen, but I suppose it could. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=479.41999999999996s)]
*  What are your thoughts on Jim Jordan as the United States Speaker of the House? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  I think that it is a dangerous prospect. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=488.53999999999996s)]
*  People make jokes and we can laugh at the circus. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=491.46000000000004s)]
*  We laugh at how ridiculous it looks. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=494.14s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we're talking about people who associate with anti-Semites, with [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=496.5s)]
*  white supremacists. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=501.06s)]
*  We're talking about people who deal and negotiate with them and have created relations. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=502.3s)]
*  This is an election denier. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=507.7s)]
*  This is someone who asks for a pardon himself among the many dangerous things he's done. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=509.18s)]
*  So I think about the communities in our country who need a strong government. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  And this would be the leader that we would send. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=517.46s)]
*  This is the leader that the Republican Party sends in this moment that we're in, someone [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=519.46s)]
*  who is friends of a white supremacist, anti-Semites, and the like, the David Duke with no baggage. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=523.9000000000001s)]
*  So I think it is a really serious issue we have. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=530.46s)]
*  And I think that we really have to think of the implications of someone who has peddled [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=533.72s)]
*  in the extreme conspiracy theories he has, someone who has put forth the extreme policy [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=537.4000000000001s)]
*  positions he has, and someone who has created and maintained friendships with the extreme [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=542.34s)]
*  people that he has, leading our caucus and our country second in line. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=547.98s)]
*  Yeah, I should just note that Steve Scalise was the one who once referred to himself as [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=553.0200000000001s)]
*  David Duke without the baggage, not Jim Jordan, just so folks who are at home are tracking [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=557.1s)]
*  Congresswoman Summer Lee. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=561.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=563.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKG3kQ8u3w&t=564.5600000000001s)]
