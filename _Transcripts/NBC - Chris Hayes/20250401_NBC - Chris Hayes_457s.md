# ‘Game on’: NBC News projects Republicans win Florida special elections, but Democrats overperform
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o)
*  Claire McCaskill is a former Democratic senator from Missouri. Fernanda Mondi is a veteran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic pollster and strategist who hails from Florida, and they both join me now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=4.24s)]
*  Fernanda, let me go to you first. We're getting some results from that other contested race [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=8.16s)]
*  in Florida 1 as that comes in, because those polls closed an hour later. Your read on what [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=14.88s)]
*  we were just hearing about the sort of mood inside the Josh Wheel party there and their [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=23.36s)]
*  understanding of what kind of the hill they were trying to climb is and what tonight's results might [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=28.4s)]
*  mean. Chris, I think we can define it already. Even waiting for the results in the District 1 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=33.76s)]
*  race with two words, game on, these are very bad numbers for the Trump administration, certainly, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=40.96s)]
*  because look, even those of us in Florida, we never really expected either of these seats to be one, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=48.16s)]
*  but the fact that plus 30 seats, deep, deep ruby red Republican seats have had a 20-point shift, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=52.96s)]
*  or in some cases we're seeing in the other race right now, it's virtually tied. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  What does that project for the rest of the country? Wherever else there's going to be a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=63.6s)]
*  close election or an election that was decided by four or five points, you've got to be deeply, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=66.56s)]
*  deeply concerned if you're the Republican party right now looking at these numbers, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=71.68s)]
*  especially given that this is still supposed to be the honeymoon Trump at the apex of his powers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=75.04s)]
*  We're seeing anything but that. If I could just make one other quick point. I think Cory Booker [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=80.96s)]
*  doing that tonight as well, not just historic. I'm going to make a prediction on this broadcast, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  Chris. We saw the record set tonight for the longest Senate floor speech. You're going to see [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=90.16s)]
*  that record broken several times over the next couple of years. There's 46 other Democratic [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=94.88s)]
*  senators. Cory Booker has broken the seal. Now the endurance test challenge is going to go to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  all the other ones because they have finally found their voice, and the voice is resist. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=105.44s)]
*  Do not let the fascist regime, which unfortunately is the path that the Trump administration is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=110.48s)]
*  clearly showing they're taking in these first two months, win, and they have to stand up and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=115.36s)]
*  inspire because certainly a huge segment of the American voters feel that way. We're seeing that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=120.08s)]
*  in Florida 6 and in Florida 1 tonight. Fernanda, let me just say we have that call there for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=124.96s)]
*  Randy Fine over Joshua Hill. Right now that's about 11 points with 91% in. And in that other [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=130.96s)]
*  race in Congressional District 1, if I can do my T-MU brand Steve Kornacki here, that's right now [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=136.56s)]
*  that's looking like a six-point race. We should note that we got 50% of the vote written right [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=144.8s)]
*  away. That was probably the early vote that tends to swing more Democratic. It's clearly moving [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  towards the Republicans as it goes in. But still, that's a six-point race with 75% in. Again, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=155.6s)]
*  Gates won against this exact same candidate, Gabe Valamant, just in November by 30-plus points. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=161.6s)]
*  So Claire, we still got Wisconsin tonight. The most interesting moments happened to me in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=168.24s)]
*  last week was the announcement about Stefanik last week when they said, sorry, Congresswoman, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  we know this is your life's goal. We know that you're quite literally probably measuring the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=181.92s)]
*  drapes for the penthouse in the sky across the UN. But I got bad news for you. We need you in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=185.92s)]
*  there. Hold on one second. We do have a call there in that other district. Jimmy Petornis Will [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  is projected to be the winner in Florida House Special 1. That's a Republican who is running [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=199.76s)]
*  in that seat to replace a guy by the name of Matt Gates. He is projected to win again with 74% of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=205.28s)]
*  the vote in. Up six points in a district that Gates carried against this very same Democrat [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=211.84s)]
*  just three or four months ago by a 30-point margin. So we're looking at, as of now, a 24-point swing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=217.52s)]
*  or something like that towards Democrats. Now, again, much lower turnout. It's probably going to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=226.24s)]
*  be roughly about half of the turnout we saw in November when now all of a sudden done. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=230.56s)]
*  But clear to this point, everyone can read these numbers. And if you just say, look, 20-point swing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=235.68s)]
*  in a special, that Stefanik seat, which is a safe seat, is all of a sudden essentially a toss-up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=242.16s)]
*  And that decision they made last week is both looking pretty smart, but also that they [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  understand there's something afoot here. Yeah. And by the way, it showed weakness. And we all know [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=253.68s)]
*  how Trump loves to show weakness. Basically saying, I can't win her district. She has to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=259.04s)]
*  stay in her job is a huge admission from Donald Trump. And I think what's happening tonight, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  and by the way, Chris, I want to say that my sources on the Hill and that no people in the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=272.16s)]
*  White House, part of them are kind of hoping that Musk crashes tonight. If Musk crashes tonight, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  it slows him down. And to say that there is a lot of nervousness among Republicans on Capitol Hill [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=285.2s)]
*  about Elon Musk is an understatement. They know he is not popular. They know he's less popular [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=293.28s)]
*  than Donald Trump. And you've already done a good job of explaining that Trump's numbers are not one [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  that any new president should be proud of. So it really is, I think tonight, Wisconsin is really an [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=303.84s)]
*  inflection point. If the Democratic candidate for the Supreme Court wins there, I think you're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=311.52s)]
*  going to have some Republicans on Capitol Hill that are going to be relieved. And it will be [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  interesting to see how Donald Trump handles Elon Musk. That's a really interesting point on that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=321.2s)]
*  On that must. It's perplexing because he's just so, he's such a compelling, charismatic, gripping [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=326.0s)]
*  figure. He's just, I just find him so just sort of relentlessly likable in public. It's just weird [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  that it hasn't sort of worn that well. There's some interesting polling, Claire, to your point. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=338.32s)]
*  I mean, all this stuff benchmarks off the top of the ticket, right? There's local issues in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=342.96s)]
*  Wisconsin, particularly there's lots of local issues. That court is going to decide whether a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=347.68s)]
*  sort of defrosted caveman law on abortion is going to come back to life or not. But for now, I mean, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=351.6s)]
*  we've got new AP polling on Trump's approval today. He's minus 14. Like, it's 42% approved, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=358.64s)]
*  56% disapproved. He's got bad numbers on the economy and stuff. Again, we're early here, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=363.92s)]
*  but they have been trying to pull off this almost this kind of psych job. Resistance is futile. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  And it does seem to me that tonight might be a little bit of an inflection point to Claire, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=376.48s)]
*  to what Claire was saying about how effective that psych job is. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=381.36s)]
*  Well, you know, remember they like to invent the reality-based world that they live in, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=387.6s)]
*  in between their ears, and that crashes against election results, as we're seeing tonight. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=392.16s)]
*  And certainly the other metric for that, as you alluded to, Chris, is approval rating. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=396.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has the lowest approval rating of any president since modern polling started [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=400.32000000000005s)]
*  at this early point in his administration. And I think Claire also mentioned as well, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=405.68s)]
*  their brand has always been strength. Well, we're seeing anything but strength. We're seeing [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  weakness tonight. And we're also seeing that the resistance is alive and well. And I think you're [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=414.72s)]
*  going to see the same flow of dollars to other races and others' campaigns set off by the stampede [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  tonight. I think tonight is the night that Democrats and the coalition that is now anti-Trump [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=426.0s)]
*  has found its voice. It's going to be an interesting now, two months and two years ahead before the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=431.2s)]
*  midterms. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvfTSnUz-o&t=436.0s)]
