# ‘Thug’ Pelosi rips House GOP for taking direction from man ‘in court’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM)
*  Nancy Pelosi has represented San Francisco for more than 35 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=0.0s)]
*  She is, of course, former Democratic speaker of the House, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=3.0s)]
*  led the House Democratic caucus for 20 years, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=5.32s)]
*  and Speaker Emerita Pelosi joins me now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=7.44s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=10.44s)]
*  I guess my first question to you, as someone who has started in politics [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=12.92s)]
*  from the time you were a child with your father as the mayor of Baltimore [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=17.6s)]
*  and know politics very well, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=20.76s)]
*  are you surprised it has gotten this bad over there [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=23.48s)]
*  and it's gone this long? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=27.88s)]
*  Well, first, may I thank you for the opportunity to spend some time with you? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=30.88s)]
*  What I learned in Baltimore from my father was how to count votes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=34.64s)]
*  That's always really important. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=40.72s)]
*  And that seems to be something that is lacking on the other side of the aisle. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=43.08s)]
*  Am I surprised? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=47.56s)]
*  I'm rarely surprised in politics, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=49.2s)]
*  but I do think that it is surprising that the Republicans [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=52.08s)]
*  do not honor the oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=56.12s)]
*  to honor the institution in which we serve, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=62.12s)]
*  and to respect the obligation that we have to the American people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=65.8s)]
*  to get the job done for them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=69.96s)]
*  And so whatever differences we may have, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=72.68s)]
*  and we all have our differences in politics within our party, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=75.68s)]
*  vis-a-vis the other party and the rest, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=79.64s)]
*  at some point you have to come to a decision [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=82.0s)]
*  as to how you're going to get the job done. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=85.64s)]
*  You weigh the equities. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  I care about this, I care about that, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=89.96s)]
*  but do I care about the American people the most? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  Do I care about my oath of office? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=95.28s)]
*  Do I respect the institution in which I serve? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  That should outweigh any of the other differences that we all have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=100.96s)]
*  within our parties or within the Congress. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=105.84s)]
*  I want to follow up on that, a little bit of shop talk from someone who is, I think, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=108.44s)]
*  by widely seen across the ideological spectrum by observers [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=111.84s)]
*  as one of the most effective legislative leaders of our time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  You heard Saul Hill maybe talking about the sort of resentments that have built up, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=122.12s)]
*  People are mad, these sort of, after each round there's some new faction. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=126.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=130.84s)]
*  How do you go about, on the Democratic side, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=131.88s)]
*  where there is, I think, more of a sheer governing vision, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=134.72s)]
*  like stitching those factions together? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=137.48s)]
*  What is your approach? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=139.36s)]
*  What would be an approach of a leader who rises to the occasion [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=140.72s)]
*  to try to, like, get people over that sense of feeling angry or hurt or snubbed? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=144.28s)]
*  I would say one word which would define it all, respect. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Respect, which leads you to build consensus, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=155.88s)]
*  to come to a place where people weigh the equities and, as I said before, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=159.32s)]
*  come to a conclusion that for this vote at this time, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=164.36s)]
*  this is the right thing for our country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=168.48s)]
*  I also accept any compliment on behalf of my House Democrats [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=170.96s)]
*  by the courage to make some of the difficult decisions that are needed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=175.12s)]
*  to come to consensus on a particular vote [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=180.12s)]
*  and live to have another debate another day, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=183.44s)]
*  but not try to win every fight every day. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=186.92s)]
*  Watch your, pick your fights carefully, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=189.52s)]
*  respect your caucus and build consensus. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=191.8s)]
*  By the way, I was down to two votes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=197.4s)]
*  I was down to two. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=199.8s)]
*  I was down to two. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes, and we never saw anything like this, as many people have remarked upon. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=204.08s)]
*  One of the things that happened today, which seems to me a really... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, part of this, frankly, I find sort of entertaining [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=212.44000000000003s)]
*  because it's just... it's sort of funny to watch. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=215.56s)]
*  But something that's sort of darker to me is the fact that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=218.44000000000003s)]
*  Tom Emmer's vote to certify the election [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=221.56s)]
*  and any vote to certify the election, to uphold, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=224.44s)]
*  as Jamie Raskin often puts it, the Constitutional Republic, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  is clearly a red line for Donald Trump personally and the MAGA faction. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=230.12s)]
*  I wonder what you think the implications are for the country and for the House [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=234.28s)]
*  if that is the case, if that is a disqualifying vote. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=238.76s)]
*  Well, let's just look at today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=242.16s)]
*  Today, you had the former president of the United States in court, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=244.68s)]
*  his chief chief, as he called himself in his book, Meadows, Mark Meadows, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  saying that he told the president that he was wrong about the election, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  at least that's what's represented in the press. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=260.32s)]
*  The president's in court, the president's chief is getting immunity [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  for what he has to say about what the president knew about the election. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=269.24s)]
*  And you have the Republicans in Congress listening to a... [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  president in court whose own chief of staff is saying he was wrong [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=279.68s)]
*  and they're using that as the basis on how they go forward. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=284.76s)]
*  But I gained from that, what I learned from that is, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=288.92s)]
*  to the Republicans in America, take back your party, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=291.8s)]
*  the grand old party, a great party that made such a contribution to our country, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=295.36s)]
*  with great leadership in so many ways. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, who am I to be advocating for a strong Republican party, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=303.76s)]
*  but it's what our country needs in addition to a strong Democratic party [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=308.32s)]
*  or whatever other party that people put out there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  But not to have a cult to really effectively a thug [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=314.55999999999995s)]
*  as the represent manifestation of the Republican Party now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=320.4s)]
*  The same day he's in court, his chief of staff asks for immunity [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=324.2s)]
*  and they're following the lead of the person [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=330.08s)]
*  whom his chief of staff is asking for immunity to tell the truth about. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=334.88s)]
*  Something's wrong with this picture. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  And I just think that if we can just get over this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  and the Republicans can be their true self, their conservative self, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=345.0s)]
*  not fringe element off the spectrum of where you are in terms of the role of government. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=349.28s)]
*  They don't believe in governance. Understand that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=356.12s)]
*  So this for them is not any break in the action. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=360.08s)]
*  They don't want any action. This is it. This is like Gloria, hallelujah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=364.32s)]
*  Yeah, they don't seem in a rush. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=370.2s)]
*  They don't seem particularly, I mean, they're mad at each other. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  I want to ask about one of the things, one of the pressing reasons [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=373.84s)]
*  there's a government shutdown that will happen. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=376.88s)]
*  And obviously, as the president announced in that prime time speech, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=378.88s)]
*  aid, right, an aid package to Ukraine and to Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=382.64s)]
*  Those are the pressing concerns for a policy agenda. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=386.28s)]
*  I want to ask about the Israel portion of that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  because we've talked about some of the internal factions in the Republican Party. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=392.76s)]
*  And in the Democratic Party, I think there's widespread consensus [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=395.92s)]
*  and support for that aid package. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=399.4s)]
*  But there are about two dozen members who are now calling for a ceasefire [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=400.68s)]
*  and sponsoring a resolution concerned about escalation [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=404.24s)]
*  and what it would mean both at a humanitarian and strategic level. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=406.96s)]
*  I wonder if you are having inter caucus conversations about those concerns, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=410.4s)]
*  if you share those concerns and where you think the party goes next on this, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=414.4s)]
*  the next step in this very, very difficult situation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=417.96s)]
*  Well, first, let me just say that our priority right now is to get the hostages freed. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  I thought that what Secretary Blinken said today at the United Nations, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  calling for humanitarian pause in the military actions [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=433.24s)]
*  so that we can try to find a more peaceful path, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=438.16s)]
*  and especially right away, to get more hostages freed. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=442.68s)]
*  Not just American, although that's our responsibility, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=447.2s)]
*  but all the hostages freed. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=450.88s)]
*  The ceasefire, I think the humanitarian pause is the appropriate way to go. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=453.12s)]
*  Look, what Hamas did was barbaric in Israel. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=461.68s)]
*  It was barbaric. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=465.96s)]
*  It was outside the circle of civilized human behavior. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=466.92s)]
*  And if it happened to your family, you would want justice. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not talking about revenge. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=474.6s)]
*  I want just, I'm saying justice. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=476.0s)]
*  So there has to be some other place we go instead of just saying, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=478.44s)]
*  let's have a ceasefire. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=484.12s)]
*  I mean, we had a ceasefire in May. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=485.44s)]
*  That was broken by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=487.12s)]
*  So let's remember that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=491.2s)]
*  But there may be a few votes in our caucus who may not support the package, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  but I think by and large, it will be overwhelmingly supported. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  We just have to get a speaker on the Republican side. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=504.92s)]
*  They won. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=508.6s)]
*  They've got the confidence of the American people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=509.68s)]
*  Now they should show they're worthy of that confidence by at least electing a leader, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=512.68s)]
*  a speaker, so that we can conduct the business of Congress. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=517.36s)]
*  And that includes coming forth with this package and then keeping government open after that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=522.24s)]
*  But to your point, I think there may be a few votes against, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=529.04s)]
*  and some of those votes have been vocal, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  but overwhelmingly there will be support for it in the Democratic side. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  The order of operations here requires a speaker of the House before any of that can happen, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=540.48s)]
*  at least as the rules are currently constituted, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=544.32s)]
*  though who knows what tomorrow will bring. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=546.08s)]
*  Congresswoman and Speaker of America Nancy Pelosi, always a pleasure to have you on. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=547.72s)]
*  Thank you, ma'am. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=551.12s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwA-H3OnBM&t=563.32s)]
