# AOC rips GOP for targeting Manhattan DA ‘Outright abuse of power’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc)
*  Still with me Congressman Jamie Raskin and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=0.0s)]
*  ranking and vice ranking members of the House Oversight Committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=5.24s)]
*  I wanted to ask you today, obviously, that the President's son, Hunter Biden, was convicted [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=7.76s)]
*  in federal court on the counts that he was charged with. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=12.02s)]
*  And I wanted to just read the President's statement and get your reaction, because it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=14.48s)]
*  was pretty striking, particularly given the last few weeks we've had. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=18.04s)]
*  The President said, I will accept the outcome of this case, will continue to respect the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=21.64s)]
*  judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=24.66s)]
*  Will and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=27.52s)]
*  support. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Nothing will ever change that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  What did you think of that, Congressman? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=33.76s)]
*  It was very presidential and he showed in his statement love for his son and love for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=36.96s)]
*  his country, including the rule of law. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  The different reactions between our Republican colleagues and our Democratic colleagues with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=47.56s)]
*  the Trump verdict and the Hunter Biden verdict, it's just astounding. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=53.24s)]
*  I mean, nobody on our side said that the fix was in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Nobody said that it was a travesty. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Nobody said that the justice system needs to be turned upside down. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Everybody accepted it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=69.4s)]
*  I mean, Hunter Biden, like Donald Trump, had the right of counsel, which he exercised. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=70.76s)]
*  He had the presumption of innocence. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=75.44s)]
*  He had the right to take the stand, which he chose not to do, like Donald Trump chose [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=77.08s)]
*  not to take the stand. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  And they both had unanimous jury verdicts finding that they were guilty on all accounts. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=81.6s)]
*  So I'm saying about that what I said about Donald Trump's verdict, which is they have [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=87.36s)]
*  a right to appeal and they can do that under due process. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=92.08s)]
*  Thank God we've got that in America. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to stand by the rule of law and the system of justice for the same reason [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=98.82s)]
*  that we're fighting for a Supreme Court that restores its integrity and reputation, because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=102.96s)]
*  we need to have that kind of confidence, not just at the trial level in federal court [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=108.44s)]
*  or in state court in New York. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=113.28s)]
*  We need to have it going all the way up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=114.56s)]
*  And those Supreme Court justices are just a complete runaway body at this point. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=120.56s)]
*  Speaking of state court in New York, Congresswoman, obviously you represent part of New York. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=121.56s)]
*  There was a huge amount of sort of insults and vitriol that's been directed at Alvin [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Bragg, both from Donald Trump on down and all the people that are sort of, you know, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=131.24s)]
*  carrying water for him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=134.96s)]
*  That has now escalated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=136.26s)]
*  He's being called by the House Republicans before, I think, the Judiciary Committee and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=138.64s)]
*  be grilled by House Republicans who have rallied behind Mr. Trump since his conviction last [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=144.4s)]
*  month. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=148.28s)]
*  GOP lawmakers have perpetuated his false narrative that President Biden ordered his prosecution. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=149.28s)]
*  What do you think about the fact that Alvin, that they're now escalating to the point where [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=155.72s)]
*  they will haul Alvin Bragg before Congress? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=158.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, what we are seeing here unfold is an outright abuse of power and the politicization [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=162.72s)]
*  of the seats of power that these Republicans hold in order to intimidate the courts and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=169.48s)]
*  exact political revenge. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=175.44s)]
*  I mean, we have to just look at this from a basic jurisdictional point of view. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  Alvin Bragg is not even part, this is not even a federal case in the same way. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  We're looking at a state court and we're looking at municipal and state courts and we have [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=188.16s)]
*  Republicans who are trying to haul them in on what grounds exactly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=196.4s)]
*  This is not federal court. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  They do not have jurisdiction over it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=202.36s)]
*  This is truly just an attempt at public targeting. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=204.36s)]
*  And we see that they do this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=208.96s)]
*  This is in the model of Donald Trump. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=210.34s)]
*  It is in the model of invoking and trying to incite as much anger and intimidation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  in order for them to get the outcomes that they want. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=218.56s)]
*  And they're so eager to be servile sycophants to Donald Trump that their political judgment [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=221.92s)]
*  is off because that's not where the public is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=226.8s)]
*  And the public understands with the Hunter Biden verdict and the Donald Trump verdict, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=229.2s)]
*  the rule of law is just working and they're intervening, as you say, in a state case in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=233.34s)]
*  order simply to placate Donald Trump. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=238.42s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=240.96s)]
*  What we're also seeing here is the stark contrast between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  And in President Biden, we have both, yes, a loving father who is there to be supportive [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=247.6s)]
*  of his son, but also a president who respects rule of law and is willing to accept the outcomes [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  of a case, even if that outcome is not in favor with his family or his personal outcomes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=257.56s)]
*  Whereas you have Donald Trump who takes and weaponizes the seats of government, the seats [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=265.92s)]
*  of power and embarks on a campaign of political intimidation in order to rest and secure outcomes [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=271.48s)]
*  that personally benefit him. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=279.36s)]
*  And that at the core is part of the stakes of our democracy that are before us today. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  Because once rule of law goes out the window, it is not something that is easy to get back. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  And it is very much a part of the decision that we have to make before us in the next [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=293.22s)]
*  few months. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=297.72s)]
*  Congressman Jimmy Raskin, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, thank you for all your time [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  tonight. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=302.56s)]
*  I really do appreciate it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lpBbhwKcc&t=303.56s)]
