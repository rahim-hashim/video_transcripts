# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights June 16
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw)
*  Good evening everyone from New York. I'm Eamon Mohideen in for Chris Hayes. It has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=0.0s)]
*  been one week since Donald Trump was indicted for the second time, this time [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=4.84s)]
*  over his mishandling of stolen classified documents. The ex-president's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=9.28s)]
*  legal woes are far far from over and unfortunately for Trump his calendar as [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=13.88s)]
*  a legal defendant is going to run right up against his calendar as a presidential [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=19.44s)]
*  candidate and the first major hurdle is going to come perhaps in just a few [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=24.88s)]
*  weeks from now. While nothing is set in stone there has been a great deal of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=28.96s)]
*  informed speculation that Fallon County Georgia District Attorney Fonny Willis [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=33.28s)]
*  could indict Trump for a legal election interference this August. Now if she does [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=37.96s)]
*  that would coincide with the first televised Republican primary debate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  which is tentatively scheduled for August 23rd in Milwaukee which means it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  is plausible if not likely that Trump's first debate as a 2024 candidate will [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=52.6s)]
*  unfold under the shadow of his third criminal indictment this year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=59.32s)]
*  Additionally the Republican National Committee has already announced a second [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=64.56s)]
*  debate in California and while no date has been set for that event at least for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=68.4s)]
*  now based on previous debate schedules it will likely land somewhere in the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=73.68s)]
*  fall. Right around the time that New York Attorney General Letitia James and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=78.64s)]
*  her civil fraud suit against the Trump Organization is currently set to go to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=84.4s)]
*  trial which is in October and the calendar does not actually get any [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  easier for Donald Trump from then out. The RNC still has not picked a date for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=91.92s)]
*  the first in the nation Iowa caucus but it is expected to take place sometime in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=96.6s)]
*  early January. Again just in time for Trump to start his second civil [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=101.32s)]
*  defamation trial with writer E. Jean Carroll who you may remember just last [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=105.76s)]
*  month the ex-president was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming her. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Well one day after that verdict came out Trump went on TV and he disparaged [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  Carroll again and those comments will be included in a second defamation suit [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=121.04s)]
*  early next year and so that is something that is certain to be front of mind for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=126.0s)]
*  Iowa voters when that trial begins right at the start of primary season. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=131.24s)]
*  Fast forward then in March amid a flurry of state primaries including the all [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=136.52s)]
*  important Super Tuesday Trump is expected to go to trial for his first [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  set of indictments over those illegal hush money payments made to adult film [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=145.44s)]
*  actress Stormy Daniels. On top of all of that there are still a number of unknown [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=149.44s)]
*  factors complicating things for Donald Trump. We do not know for example when [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=155.36s)]
*  Florida judge Aileen Cannon will set the start of Trump's second criminal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=160.4s)]
*  trial in the documents case and even if she does punt that case until I don't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=164.72s)]
*  know after the election like some have speculated she might it is still [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=169.76s)]
*  entirely possible that special counsel Jack Smith indicts Donald Trump again for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=173.84s)]
*  the documents but this time not for the documents but this time in New Jersey or [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=179.16s)]
*  in Washington DC. Additionally Jack Smith may still indict Trump on unrelated [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=183.4s)]
*  charges stemming from the January 6th insurrection which makes it all the more [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=189.12s)]
*  ridiculous that the RNC is demanding that the candidates pledge their loyalty [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  to whomever wins the primary even even if that candidate is currently on trial. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=200.32s)]
*  Imagine a loyalty pledge is worth remembering Donald Trump himself for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=205.84s)]
*  a nigdaun back in 2016. More than six months ago you pledged to support the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  Republican nominee whoever that may be. Do you continue to pledge whoever the Republican nominee is? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=215.92s)]
*  No I don't anymore. You don't? No we'll see who it is. So the pledge you took is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Nolan Voight the idea of supporting whoever the Republican nominee is you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=225.76s)]
*  say you will no longer guarantee that you will support the Republican nominee. I have been treated very untruthfully. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=229.92s)]
*  But this time Trump does not just want his opponents to pledge that they will [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  support him he wants them to pledge that they will pardon him. As Rolling Stone [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=237.44s)]
*  reports Trump's inner circle has been sending a simple message to other 2024 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=243.4s)]
*  candidates promise you will pardon Trump if you are elected or else. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is the front runner for the Republican nomination and because of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=255.72s)]
*  that voters deserve to know what he is accused of doing by special counsel Jack [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=259.96s)]
*  Smith who indicted the ex-president 37 criminal counts in connection with his [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=264.8s)]
*  handling of classified documents. Now Smith pledged to seek a speedy trial in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=269.2s)]
*  the case against Trump and when it begins the American people quite frankly [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=273.76s)]
*  should be able to hear it and see it. They should hear the prosecutors [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=278.92s)]
*  allegations and their evidence about Trump storing hundreds of classified [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=282.44s)]
*  documents all over his Mar-a-Lago estate and refusing to give them back as well [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  as the ex-presidents defense. It will be key for this trial to be as transparent [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=291.28s)]
*  as possible especially if it happens at the same time as the election when [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=298.0s)]
*  Americans may have to decide whether or not they will vote for Donald Trump. So [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  how do you not hold a public trial when the defendant is a serial liar and truth [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=307.88s)]
*  in this country is consistently under assault. Of course there is also one [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=313.64s)]
*  other big complicating factor the case is about highly classified and sensitive [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  national security information. Nancy Gertner served as a federal judge for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=324.12s)]
*  nearly 20 years and is now a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School. She [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  joins me now. Nancy it's great to have you with us. This is obviously a very [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=332.04s)]
*  complicated conversation but I think a lot of people now are demanding because [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=335.12s)]
*  of the unprecedented nature of this there needs to be more transparency and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=339.64s)]
*  as much transparency as possible. How can the court balance the need for a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=344.64s)]
*  public trial with the classified information involved in this case? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=349.32s)]
*  Let me start at the classified information issue because that actually [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=354.28s)]
*  is an enormous complication even if you were sitting in the courtroom as a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=358.52s)]
*  member of the public physically there you may not be entitled to see the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=362.84s)]
*  evidence that is being presented in this case. There could be circumstances under [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  which the only people who can see the evidence would be the judge, the lawyers [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=373.0s)]
*  who have gotten a security clearance and that would be it and it would be kept [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  from the public even the public sitting there. So you can't deny [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=381.8s)]
*  sort of how complicated this is going to be in a physical setting to deal with [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  classified information quite apart from cameras. The other side which is the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=391.12s)]
*  Judicial Conference of the United States has been resisting cameras in the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=397.6s)]
*  courtroom from over 30 years and the the explanation the rationale gets more and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=402.28s)]
*  more ridiculous as time goes on and I think we're at a moment when it is at [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=408.4s)]
*  its most ridiculous and that is during the pandemic video was used to portray [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  proceedings to show proceedings and the Republic didn't fall and now you're [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=420.4s)]
*  talking in many courts around the country about you know about dialing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=426.52s)]
*  back on that. It was mostly civil proceedings there's no question about it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=430.56s)]
*  but we learned how to do it consistent with the dignity of the courtroom [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=434.24s)]
*  because we had to. So the question is whether the Judicial Conference will [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=438.96s)]
*  back off on its opposed opposition to cameras whether or not the judge would [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=444.0s)]
*  be allowed to make an exception in this case in any event because of the public [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  nature of it and then how you navigate a camera when they're classified [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=453.68s)]
*  information. So I mean I think this is this is complicated a lot has to be [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=460.28s)]
*  weighed right but the problem with the federal courts is that they haven't [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=464.4s)]
*  even been willing to engage in the discussion at all ever. Yeah and I was [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=467.84s)]
*  going to pick up on that point because on one hand you know the Supreme Court [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  has said that the presence of a camera does not compromise the due process [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=478.08s)]
*  rights of a defendant and that's why we see in certain cases on a state level at [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=482.84s)]
*  least trials are broadcast and even when the pandemic happened as you mentioned [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  the Supreme Court began live streaming its own oral hearing so to some extent [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=491.36s)]
*  the presence of recording devices and more transparency has not undermined the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=496.08000000000004s)]
*  credibility of the proceedings itself. What makes this case also even more [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=501.64000000000004s)]
*  compelling for it to be transparent is you have a judge that a lot of people [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=507.12s)]
*  have concerns about given the way she ruled in the initial phases of this [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=511.36s)]
*  case. Do you think Judge Cannon would be amenable to broadcasting this trial? It [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=515.92s)]
*  may not be up to her exclusively but do you have concerns about her judgment [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=521.36s)]
*  based on her initial rulings and her experience that she can be fair and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=524.92s)]
*  impartial? Right there are two separate questions about whether she'd be amenable to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  cameras. I mean really the federal judges have I testified against the judicial [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=533.68s)]
*  conference when I was on the bench in favor of cameras because state courts [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=538.92s)]
*  have had cameras in the courtroom in incendiary trials bloody horrible trials [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=543.16s)]
*  and again have managed to do it in a respectful way so the notion that the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=548.88s)]
*  federal court has backed office doesn't make any sense as I said ever and surely [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=553.48s)]
*  doesn't make sense now. Will Judge Cannon do it? It's hard to say I think it is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  certainly more comfortable for her not to it's not more fair but it's more [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=564.4s)]
*  comfortable and on the broader question implicit in what you've asked on her [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=568.48s)]
*  remaining in the case I doubt very much if she will recuse herself and the only [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=572.56s)]
*  ground for the government to seek her recusal is that what she did in the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=580.3599999999999s)]
*  investigation was not just bad judgment but essentially carving out rules and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=585.4s)]
*  procedures that made that did not ever apply to a criminal prosecution and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  carving out special treatment of a federal because he was the president of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=597.1199999999999s)]
*  the United States so her ruling demonstrated a degree of bias which was [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=601.48s)]
*  extraordinary. Will she recuse herself? Doubtful. Will Jack Smith move to recuse [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=607.4s)]
*  her? I actually think that that's doubtful as well. Nancy Gertner it's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=613.76s)]
*  obviously a complicated question as you mentioned but I couldn't think of a [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=618.36s)]
*  better guest to speak to about this it's certainly something we will watch [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  closely as we get more insight into how this trial unfolds. Nancy Gertner thank [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=624.72s)]
*  you so much for your time and your insight. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=629.0s)]
*  We aren't interested in whether or not the accusations against Vice President [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=631.8000000000001s)]
*  Biden are accurate or not. Senator how damning is this document to the sitting [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=638.32s)]
*  US president? Well it's I I don't know that and that's what we need. But you've read it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=644.04s)]
*  I read it let's put it this way there's accusations in it. Where is that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=651.0s)]
*  informant today? Where are these whistleblowers? Well unfortunately we [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=656.38s)]
*  can't track down the informants. This oligarch is a high ranking was a high [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=662.02s)]
*  ranking member or owner of Burisma? Yes that is exactly right. So have you had [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=666.34s)]
*  any contact with him? Unfortunately nobody's had any contact with him for [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=674.06s)]
*  the last three years. So the Republicans to put it mildly have been obsessed with [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=679.66s)]
*  promoting and investigating a bogus debunked conspiracy theory that Joe [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=685.3s)]
*  Biden as vice president took millions of dollars in bribes from a foreign [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=690.38s)]
*  national. House Republicans specifically the chair of the House Oversight [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=694.14s)]
*  Committee James Comer threatened the FBI director with a contempt of Congress [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=698.2199999999999s)]
*  vote if he did not show them some unsubstantiated whistleblower form. And [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=701.9799999999999s)]
*  now the latest Republican bombshell? Well that revelation is that there is or at [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=707.26s)]
*  least several audio tapes between Joe Biden and an executive from the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=712.74s)]
*  Ukrainian firm Burisma that prove once and for all that Joe Biden took bribes [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=716.98s)]
*  while serving as vice president in the Obama administration. Except here's the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=722.94s)]
*  thing they're not so sure that those tapes actually exist. There are two [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=728.94s)]
*  recordings from with on one end of this phone line or whatever is Joe Joseph [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=735.3s)]
*  Robin O'biden and another is someone from Burisma. Yes. Because Biden has said [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=740.66s)]
*  unequivocally time and time again I have nothing to do with Burisma I know [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=745.98s)]
*  nothing about it. And you Chuck Grassley has heard his voice on these recordings? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=749.98s)]
*  So Grassley has not heard them. What Grassley has done is he's the only [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=756.38s)]
*  senator who's read an unredacted version of the FD 1023. So he's read the report [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=760.78s)]
*  and the report alleges that these recordings exist. We don't know for a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=767.0200000000001s)]
*  fact that that's true. So these recordings are legit. You can confirm [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=770.98s)]
*  they are legitimate. They were I can confirm they were listed in the 1023 [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=774.46s)]
*  that the FBI redacted. I don't know if they're legit or not. So it's quite [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=778.9000000000001s)]
*  apparent that the whole Republican boondoggle is falling apart. And here's [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=784.5400000000001s)]
*  the thing they're getting pretty defensive about it. Watch you have the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=788.88s)]
*  liberal media like MSNBC with their low acu audience that that that are sitting [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=793.02s)]
*  there and they're being told bad things about me and members of the oversight [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=797.78s)]
*  because we have the audacity to investigate. MSNBC makes fun of me when [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=802.18s)]
*  I said that there are a lot of people that were involved in the Biden [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=805.9s)]
*  shenanigans that that are currently missing. Yeah. So look it is again that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=810.5s)]
*  backdrop of what you just heard there of missing witnesses and uncorroborated [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=817.02s)]
*  report a bombshell audio tape that may or may not exist that congressman Dan [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=821.38s)]
*  Goldman of New York who actually sits on the oversight committee that is [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=827.06s)]
*  investigating the president debunked the Republican conspiracy theory. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=830.38s)]
*  Did the majority actually find some actual evidence of wrongdoing by the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=836.3s)]
*  president? Of course not. But it's even worse than that. This document that they [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=841.9399999999999s)]
*  will not stop talking about is shockingly just a three year old second [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=848.42s)]
*  hand hearsay uncorroborated rehashing of Rudy Giuliani's bogus allegations that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=853.78s)]
*  he got from Ukrainian corrupt Ukrainian officials. Now we all know that former [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=862.38s)]
*  president Donald Trump was impeached because he tried to extort President [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=867.9s)]
*  Zelensky to announce an investigation into this Ukrainian company Barisma [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=871.42s)]
*  that would benefit Trump's political campaign. The theory goes that then vice [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=877.42s)]
*  president urged Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general because he was [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=882.5799999999999s)]
*  investigating Barisma and the president wanted to help his son who was on the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=887.4599999999999s)]
*  Barisma board. You know where Rudy Giuliani got this information from that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=892.02s)]
*  fired prosecutor general himself the corrupt prosecutor general and we know [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=897.78s)]
*  with absolute certainty now that the truth is exactly the opposite and to be [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=904.26s)]
*  very clear then vice president Biden executed official United States foreign [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=909.9399999999999s)]
*  policy shared by the EU and the IMF to urge you came to Ukraine to fire the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=915.66s)]
*  prosecutor general because he was not prosecuting corruption in Ukraine. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=921.8599999999999s)]
*  Congressman Jasmine Crockett is a Democrat of Texas who serves on the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=929.42s)]
*  Oversight Committee. She joins me now. Congresswoman, it's great to see you [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=932.46s)]
*  again. Thank you for making time. What do you make of this of this nonsense from [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=935.26s)]
*  the Republicans? I mean, this recycled Giuliani created conspiracy theory that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=939.7800000000001s)]
*  now seems to be at the center of this Republican obsession. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=944.14s)]
*  I mean, the Republicans are like good at distractions and that's exactly what we [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=950.7s)]
*  have. It is so unfortunate that they're talking about what they read. But let [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=956.98s)]
*  me make it very plain for the people that are watching the very first [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=962.38s)]
*  document that we read specifically said that we are not to dispose what it is [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=967.54s)]
*  that we're reading. So I'm going to tell you that for some reason I don't really [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=972.1s)]
*  trust their ability to actually read and take in what it is that they read [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=976.46s)]
*  because the very first page said do not talk about the content. And so all I [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=981.5s)]
*  will say because as Democrats we like to follow rules is that their rendition of [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=987.38s)]
*  what was in this document is a little different from what I read in this [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=994.1s)]
*  document. Now granted, I did read the redacted version. I've read redacted [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=999.9s)]
*  documents for years and years and years practicing law. But I'm telling you, I [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1004.98s)]
*  don't think that those few black marks that I saw had all this information that [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1009.62s)]
*  the senator has been talking about. And I also want people to understand what [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1015.18s)]
*  they like to do is they want to deflect and say, no, no, forget Trump. What about [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1019.9s)]
*  Hillary? No, no, no, forget Trump. What about Biden? Well, what about them? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1025.74s)]
*  Let's be clear. Neither one of them have been indicted for any wrongdoing, yet [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1030.3799999999999s)]
*  they both been investigated extensively and the president is still currently [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1033.98s)]
*  being investigated. But you know what? I can almost guarantee you I would put [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1038.42s)]
*  money on it that at the end of the investigation that is finally taking [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1041.9s)]
*  place with the president and his ability or his handling of the classified [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1045.22s)]
*  documents, I can tell you that he most likely will not end up facing the number [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1050.8600000000001s)]
*  of charges that Trump is facing. I just called me, you know, Miss Cleo, but I [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1056.26s)]
*  don't believe that he will end up facing a similar fate. Well, let me just say [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1061.94s)]
*  it's on brand for Republicans to your point. It's on brand for Republicans to [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1066.6200000000001s)]
*  not be able to follow the rules and to give up what is considered to be [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1070.18s)]
*  confidential information, whether it's Trump holding on to these documents in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1074.3400000000001s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago, or as you were just saying, the Republicans reading a document from [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1077.38s)]
*  the FBI that they were told not to disclose and then turn around and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1081.02s)]
*  broadcast it on on TV. But it kind of makes me wonder, as you said, this is [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1083.94s)]
*  about politics, more or less, and I'm kind of putting words here in your [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1089.1000000000001s)]
*  mouth. But tell me about this, because I think Republicans are doing this or [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1092.9s)]
*  pushing this the same way they pushed Benghazi to try to lower Hillary [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1096.5s)]
*  Clinton's numbers. That's what Kevin McCarthy at the time said. And now [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1101.06s)]
*  they're trying to do this to hurt Joe Biden politically. Am I wrong? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1104.34s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. I mean, it's nothing but a game for them. And the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1109.38s)]
*  problem is that we have real lives on the other side of this game that they're [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1112.5s)]
*  playing. And I do want to go back really quickly to something that you just said. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1115.74s)]
*  We should not trust Republicans with any secrets. I mean, if y'all haven't [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1121.18s)]
*  realized that from seeing all the boxes in the bathroom, just listen to this [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1125.22s)]
*  nonsense. And at the same time, we also should not expect the truth out of the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1129.58s)]
*  Republicans, because theoretically, I guess, technically, they haven't [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1134.38s)]
*  necessarily disclosed everything that was in the documents, because honestly, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1138.1000000000001s)]
*  some of this stuff they're talking about, I'm like, that wasn't in there. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1142.18s)]
*  That wasn't in there. And another good point to be made about the document is [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1144.66s)]
*  something that Dan Goldman was bringing out. I want people to understand the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1150.22s)]
*  timeline. This is, I think it was three pages total. It was basically two pages [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1153.66s)]
*  and then a portion of another page that we reviewed. And as far as the timeline [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1158.98s)]
*  is concerned, we're talking about someone recounting something that was told to [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1164.5400000000002s)]
*  them at least three years after allegedly, they were told this, and they [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1169.14s)]
*  had all these details in their mind and whatnot. And also, to be clear, as my [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1174.94s)]
*  ranking member who can be trusted with the truth, Jamie Raskin, he laid it out [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1179.66s)]
*  and made it clear that it's not that this information came and then it was just [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1183.94s)]
*  thrown away. It was actually Trump's administration. It was Trump's DOJ that [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1189.5400000000002s)]
*  received this information and they followed through and there was nothing to [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1194.26s)]
*  follow through with. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1cm1g2uiKw&t=1198.18s)]
