# Trump RNC's question for new hires: Was the 2020 election stolen?
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes, the Republican National Committee now firmly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=0.0s)]
*  in the hands of Donald Trump and his family. The party is now under the stewardship of, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=4.32s)]
*  among others, the ex-president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whose latest single, Anything [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=9.0s)]
*  Is Possible, drops this Friday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=14.08s)]
*  But in addition to her burgeoning musical career, Lara Trump is hard at work reshaping [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=16.52s)]
*  the Republican Party into an organization based first and foremost around her father-in-law [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=20.28s)]
*  and his ongoing lies about the 2020 election, which he lost. As The Washington Post reports, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=25.4s)]
*  quote, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=31.32s)]
*  And Lara Trump confirmed to NBC News' senior Capitol Hill correspondent Garrett Haake today [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=32.32s)]
*  is all in on pushing election fraud nonsense heading into this next election. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=52.8s)]
*  Is it going to be the position of the RNC in 2024 that the 2020 election was not fairly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=59.32s)]
*  decided or that it was stolen somehow? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think we're past that. I think that's in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly we [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=66.76s)]
*  took a lot of notes. Right now we have 23 states that have 78 lawsuits in these states [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=70.84s)]
*  to ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=77.22s)]
*  Here at this organization, we had sort of the inverse of this debate this week. Our [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=81.68s)]
*  litmus test is the opposite of the RNC. We're going to be part of what we used to call a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  reality-based community, one where we acknowledge the basic fact that Joe Biden won the 2020 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=89.48s)]
*  election by 7 million votes. The Republican National Committee apparently does not live [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=94.2s)]
*  in reality, instead choosing to recede into a fantasy world where the election was stolen [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  from Donald Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing that's the weirdest part of this whole thing. All right. Donald Trump [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=104.84s)]
*  is like a 50-50 coin flip to win the next election. He's leading or tied in just about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=108.76s)]
*  every relevant poll right now. He's got a real shot of outright winning the election [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=113.0s)]
*  November, but it's so revealing. The MAGA movement isn't actually interested in winning [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=117.28s)]
*  in a small-D democratic sense. It really looks to all the world based on the way they have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=123.48s)]
*  undertaken things at the RNC in the campaign. They would actually rather essentially steal [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=128.16s)]
*  the election or finish the project of upending American democracy entirely. A total rejection [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=133.56s)]
*  of free and fair elections as an achievable aim is their intended goal. This cultist devotion [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=139.92s)]
*  to the lie, the persistent enduring lie about widespread election fraud in 2020, is one [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=146.6s)]
*  of their ways of accomplishing that. Logistically speaking, the problem with that strategy is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  that every single rational good faith actor can see the election was not stolen. And every [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=156.64s)]
*  time the big lie is marched into an institution where facts and reality matter, it gets laughed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0OXhrYeb8w&t=161.64000000000001s)]
