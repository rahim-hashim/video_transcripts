# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 18
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E)
*  The gravest crime that Donald Trump ever committed was to undermine democracy, the will of the people, by trying to overthrow a free and fair election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=0.0s)]
*  And today, we saw the first signs that justice may be coming for him. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Today we learned that the ex-president received a letter from the special counsel Jack Smith, indicating that he is the target of a criminal investigation into efforts to interfere with the presidential election of 2020, leading to the insurrection on January 6, 2021. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=12.0s)]
*  According to Trump, the special counsel gave him a four-day deadline in which to speak to the Washington, D.C. grand jury hearing the case. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=29.0s)]
*  It's an offer he will almost certainly not accept, seeing that anything that he says can then be used against him in a subsequent trial. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=37.0s)]
*  And all of this indicates that the Department of Justice is wrapping up what has been a long and sprawling investigation led by this man, Jack Smith, for the past eight months. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=44.0s)]
*  We do not have any indication of what the exact charges are that Smith is considering, and the ex-president said himself, a target letter like this, quote, almost always means an arrest and indictment are coming. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=54.0s)]
*  That's exactly what happened just last month when Jack Smith sent Trump another target letter regarding the investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=67.0s)]
*  And just days after that letter became public, Smith brought a 37-count indictment against the ex-president, charging him with seven federal crimes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=75.0s)]
*  Of course, that was already the second indictment against Trump this year, following the 34 counts of falsifying business records charged by this man, the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg in April. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=85.0s)]
*  But this indictment, the third against the ex-president, and if and when it comes, will be by far the most consequential. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=97.0s)]
*  While some people might argue that the charges about Donald Trump's business practices in New York, for instance, don't really matter, or they just don't care that much about the documents at Mar-a-Lago, there's just no way for a reasonable person with elementary critical thinking skills to deny the seriousness of this case. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=105.0s)]
*  This is about a real and existential threat to our nation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=123.0s)]
*  It's about Donald Trump's attempt and his continuing attempts to undermine and possibly end our democracy as we know it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=128.0s)]
*  And in fact, there's already been a long and thorough investigation into this, resulting in the recommendation of multiple criminal charges. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=134.0s)]
*  That was done by the House January 6th Committee. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=142.0s)]
*  Last year, they methodically laid out the evidence against the ex-president, showing the American people exactly how he attempted to remain in power against their will. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=146.0s)]
*  He knew that he had lost the 2020 election, but he spread the lies about the fraud anyway. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=154.0s)]
*  And his own attorney general at the time, Bill Barr, said this to the committee. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=160.0s)]
*  The president said something like, well, we could get to the bottom. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=166.0s)]
*  Some people say we could get to the bottom of this if the department sees the machines. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=171.0s)]
*  It was a typical way of raising a point. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=176.0s)]
*  And I said, absolutely not. There's no probable cause and I'm not going to seize any machines. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=180.0s)]
*  I said, how long is he going to carry on with this stolen election stuff? Where is this going to go? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=187.0s)]
*  And by that time, Meadows had caught up with me and leaving the office and caught up to me and said that he said, look, I think that he's becoming more realistic and knows that there's a limit to how far he can take this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=195.0s)]
*  And then Jared said, you know, yeah, we're working on this. We're working on it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=218.0s)]
*  Now that January 6 committee also detailed how Trump launched a massive pressure campaign to try to get nearly all corners of the government to do his bidding, including his own vice president. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=222.0s)]
*  He tried to pressure state legislatures to reverse the results of the election in their states, but they refused. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=232.0s)]
*  He tried to enlist the Department of Justice in his efforts to overturn election results, but officials leading the department refused to comply. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=241.0s)]
*  So eventually he latched on to a completely nonsensical and anti-democratic theory that one man, his own vice president, could determine the outcome of the election. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=253.0s)]
*  He wanted the vice president to unilaterally select the president. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=266.0s)]
*  And of course, on the advice of his own lawyers, Mike Pence decided that that was not his role. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=272.0s)]
*  Donald Trump then summoned a violent mob of his supporters, hurling them at the Capitol in a bloody attack on American democracy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=279.0s)]
*  Trump has given us marching orders. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=285.0s)]
*  One post on the Donald.Win wrote, basically, if you're east of the Mississippi, you can and should be there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=288.0s)]
*  Advance on the Capitol. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=296.0s)]
*  One user asked, is the sixth D-Day, is that why Trump wants everyone there? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=298.0s)]
*  Another asserted, Trump just told us all to come armed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=305.0s)]
*  I overheard the president say something to the effect of, you know, I don't even care that they have weapons. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=310.0s)]
*  They're not here to hurt me. Take the f-ing mags away. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=316.0s)]
*  Let my people in. They can march the Capitol from here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=319.0s)]
*  Let the people in. Take the f-ing mags away. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=322.0s)]
*  That was the former White House aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, recounting how Trump wanted the mags removed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=325.0s)]
*  Those are magnetometers that help detect guns. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=330.0s)]
*  At the end of the January 6 investigation and after 10 public hearings, the committee referred four criminal charges against Donald Trump to the Department of Justice. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=333.0s)]
*  We propose to the committee advancing referrals where the gravity of the specific offense, the severity of its actual harm, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=342.0s)]
*  and the centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election compel us to speak. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=351.0s)]
*  Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=360.0s)]
*  But until now, that's exactly what's happened. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=369.0s)]
*  The foot soldiers have gone to jail and the masterminds and the ringleaders have, for the moment, had a pass. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=372.0s)]
*  So here we are, seven months later, at an historic moment with the Department of Justice poised to finally bring charges against the ex-president in the January 6 case. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=377.0s)]
*  We've already seen and heard the evidence about Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the election and bring down our system of government. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=386.0s)]
*  And if you believe that evidence, then criminal charges are the only possible response because our democracy itself is at stake. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=393.0s)]
*  Just over a month ago on June 8, Donald Trump was indicted by the special counsel Jack Smith on 37 felony counts over illegally retaining classified government documents at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=404.0s)]
*  In that investigation, lawyers for the ex-president had been told just days before that Trump was a target. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=414.0s)]
*  Today we learned that Trump received another target letter, this one for the January 6 investigation. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=421.0s)]
*  So we are now officially on indictment watch. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=427.0s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York, is a former assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=430.0s)]
*  He was the lead counsel in the first impeachment of the ex-president. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=436.0s)]
*  He joins me now. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you for being with us this evening. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=440.0s)]
*  You too, Ali. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=443.0s)]
*  Let's start with your reaction to the news of Donald Trump being informed that he's a target in the January 6 investigation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=444.0s)]
*  Not just are you a member of Congress, but you were a former prosecutor. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=450.0s)]
*  You were intimately involved with the impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=453.0s)]
*  So I'm sure no surprise to you, but it has now happened. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=456.0s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=460.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think what we've seen over the last several months is the special counsel's investigation has been really ratcheting up. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=462.0s)]
*  They had to go to court a lot to get testimony, and they were able to apparently successfully do it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=468.0s)]
*  And so I think this is the the notice that many of us have been waiting for that they are prepared to move forward with an indictment of Donald Trump to hold him accountable for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=475.0s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of folks who have been watching and saw what happened not only on January 6th, but in the lead up to January 6th and all of the increasingly lawless efforts outlined so expertly by the January 6th committee. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=488.0s)]
*  Designed to subvert democracy and overturn a lawful and proper election. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=504.0s)]
*  And now we're going to see the fruits of both of those investigations, both the January 6th, which I think provided an important roadmap for the special counsel. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=512.0s)]
*  But the special counsel has a lot more evidentiary tools available to him than Congress does. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=521.0s)]
*  So I expect we will see a lot of additional evidence. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=528.0s)]
*  Tell me as a former prosecutor and as a member of Congress and as counsel to the impeachment how that differs because those of us who are paying attention heard most of the evidence. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=532.0s)]
*  Right. It wasn't under under oath in some cases to you know the way it would be if you were reporting it to the FBI and they couldn't compel everybody who they wanted to testify. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=542.0s)]
*  But what's the difference fundamentally? What am I likely to hear out of this indictment that I didn't already know from the January 6th committee? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=552.0s)]
*  Well, I think the biggest thing that will be different is there will be a lot more witness testimony. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=559.0s)]
*  There were a number of witnesses who refused to cooperate with the January 6th committee. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=565.0s)]
*  Some ultimately like Steve Bannon were held in contempt of Congress. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=570.0s)]
*  But the grand jury process allows for the special counsel to get access to that information. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=574.0s)]
*  The other important information is that we know of and it relates also to the classified documents case is that if they are able to pierce the attorney client privilege and especially with John Eastman and his role as a quote unquote lawyer advising Donald Trump or Rudy Giuliani for that matter, that would be pursuant to the crime fraud exception. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=582.0s)]
*  And that might be available to the special counsel and it would not be available to Congress. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=604.0s)]
*  So those are just a couple of examples that you will see more evidence in this indictment and in this prosecution. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=609.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the politics of this. You heard Joyce Vance saying that what may happen to keep this thing tight and and and not subject to Donald Trump and his lawyers carrying on about the fact that he's very busy running for president so he can't be prosecuted. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=617.0s)]
*  You may see what Joyce suggested might be a less satisfying set of charges than what we expect from a sprawling investigation, something that is tight that prosecutors can make the case about and do so in a short amount of time. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=629.0s)]
*  What's your thought on that? Well, I'm particularly interested to see who else is charged and whether they are charged in the same indictment as Donald Trump or a separate indictment. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=644.0s)]
*  Because in an effort to move forward, you wouldn't necessarily want to have many defendants whose defense lawyer schedules and various other issues that might arise from a multi-defendant case slow it down. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=655.0s)]
*  But I would be very surprised if the special counsel did not include all of the evidence that he believes to be sufficient to prove a charge beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=667.0s)]
*  And the issue, of course, is not only what Donald Trump's defense lawyers do, but will also be very interesting to see what his taxpayer funded defense lawyers, also known as House Republicans, do in the coming days and weeks in response to yet another indictment of Donald Trump. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=679.0s)]
*  Let me ask you about Matt Gaetz, who says he's planning to introduce a bill to defund the special counsel's investigation. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=699.0s)]
*  What do you understand to be the legitimacy of that sort of an effort in Congress? And when what do you make of it? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=706.0s)]
*  There's no legitimacy. It's a it's a ploy. It's a charade. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=713.0s)]
*  The special counsel, of course, has been appointed pursuant to regulations and is properly funded by the Department of Justice. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=719.0s)]
*  This is just a continuation of House Republicans efforts to undermine the institutions that we rely on to adhere to the rule of law. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=728.0s)]
*  And they don't like that the FBI is investigating Donald Trump and others, perhaps some of their current or former colleagues. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=737.0s)]
*  And so they rather than actually reckon with the fact that Donald Trump appears to be a serial criminal, have decided that they're going to go after those trying to hold him accountable. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=744.0s)]
*  And it is very dangerous to our democracy, to our rule of law that they continue to try to defund the police in the form of federal law enforcement in this case solely for political purposes. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=756.0s)]
*  And when we hear about political efforts to undermine the rule of law from from my Republican colleagues, I think they ought to look in the mirror instead of across Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=770.0s)]
*  Congressman, good to see you as always. Thanks for joining us, Congressman Dan Goldman. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=783.0s)]
*  In just six months, we'll have the first election days of the twenty twenty four presidential race. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=788.0s)]
*  First, the Iowa caucuses, then New Hampshire soon thereafter. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=792.0s)]
*  And on the resume of the current favorite in that race is a staggering list of legal entanglements that the voters might want to consider. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=795.0s)]
*  This morning, we learned that the ex-president received a target letter from special counsel Jack Smith in his sprawling investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the twenty twenty election. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=803.0s)]
*  This is separate from Jack Smith's other criminal investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=813.0s)]
*  In that case, he's been indicted on thirty seven felony counts, including willful retention of documents, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements, among others. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=820.0s)]
*  Then there is the Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis's criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the election in Georgia. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=832.0s)]
*  Last night, Georgia's top court unanimously rejected Trump's last ditch effort to shut down that investigation. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=840.0s)]
*  The D.A. has set a timetable for announcing potential indictments for the coming weeks in New York. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=848.0s)]
*  The ex-president is facing a trial early next year in his thirty four count felony indictment by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over a hush money payment scheme that involved falsifying business records during the twenty sixteen election. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=854.0s)]
*  And all of that is just Donald Trump's potential criminal exposure on the civil litigation front. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=868.0s)]
*  He's facing multiple lawsuits, including one brought by the New York state attorney general that accuses Trump and his business of staggering fraud. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=875.0s)]
*  That case heads to trial in October. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=883.0s)]
*  Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen is also suing him for unpaid legal fees relating to Cohen's twenty nineteen congressional testimony. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=886.0s)]
*  Jury selection has just started in that case. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=893.0s)]
*  Back in May, the ex-president was found liable for defamation and sexual assault and ordered to pay the writer E. Gene Carroll five million dollars. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=896.0s)]
*  But his defamation trouble has not ended there. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=905.0s)]
*  In June, a federal judge allowed E. Gene Carroll to amend another defamation lawsuit against Trump to include disparaging comments that Trump made about her during a town hall. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=908.0s)]
*  Everything seems to be culminating all at once for this man who is also the front runner in the Republican primary race for president of the United States. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=919.0s)]
*  So when does any of it actually begin to matter for him politically? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=927.0s)]
*  That's what we're talking about right right after this break. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=933.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03pGcPD56E&t=949.0s)]
