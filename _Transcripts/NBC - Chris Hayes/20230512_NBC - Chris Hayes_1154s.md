# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 11
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night, let's talk about last night, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=2.0s)]
*  because last night at this time, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=4.0s)]
*  the man that led the insurrection against our democracy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=6.0s)]
*  was spewing vile nonsense on another network. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=8.0s)]
*  Of course, I was here hosting this very television show, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=11.0s)]
*  hopefully with many of you watching. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=14.0s)]
*  I did not see the whole thing play out live. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=16.0s)]
*  But I've seen enough. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=19.0s)]
*  I've seen enough to have had the same visceral reaction [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=21.0s)]
*  as many others. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=24.0s)]
*  That it was disgraceful, despicable, gross, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=26.0s)]
*  if you had that reaction too, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=29.0s)]
*  I'll just say I think that's the correct response. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=32.0s)]
*  I don't think you really need to second-guess it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=35.0s)]
*  You should just trust your gut on that one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=37.0s)]
*  That said, it's not the end of the story, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=40.0s)]
*  because there's a useful question to come out of that feeling, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=42.0s)]
*  the bad feeling, which is why? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=46.0s)]
*  Why was that town hall so bad? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=49.0s)]
*  What made it so awful? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=51.0s)]
*  Now, one possibility a lot of people suggest [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=54.0s)]
*  is that because it helped Donald Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=56.0s)]
*  A national cable news network gave him over an hour of airtime [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=59.0s)]
*  to say pretty much whatever he wanted, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=62.0s)]
*  and that provided Trump the front-runner [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=64.0s)]
*  for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=66.0s)]
*  with a lot of attention. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=68.0s)]
*  And attention for Donald Trump is a kind of power. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=71.0s)]
*  And that is likely true, this argument, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=74.0s)]
*  within the context of the Republican primary [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=77.0s)]
*  and Republican primary voters. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=79.0s)]
*  I think the town hall last night probably does [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=81.0s)]
*  help the ex-president in his quest [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=83.0s)]
*  to secure the Republican nomination. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=85.0s)]
*  And of course, that in and of itself is very dangerous, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=87.0s)]
*  because whoever becomes a Republican nominee [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=90.0s)]
*  or the nominee of either of the two major parties [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=93.0s)]
*  in securing that nomination becomes a coin flip away [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=96.0s)]
*  from becoming the next president of the United States, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=101.0s)]
*  even if, for example, that person attempted [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=104.0s)]
*  to put an end to free and fair elections [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=107.0s)]
*  in this country once and for all. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=109.0s)]
*  Now, another reason why last night's spectacle was so bad [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=111.0s)]
*  wasn't what the ex-president said, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=115.0s)]
*  but the crowd in that room. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=117.0s)]
*  CNN made the choice to pack the town hall [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=120.0s)]
*  in Manchester, New Hampshire, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=122.0s)]
*  with an unruly audience of Trump supporters. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=124.0s)]
*  And so what Americans saw was a display [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=126.0s)]
*  of our fellow citizens, we feel like we're people, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=128.0s)]
*  we share the country with them, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=131.0s)]
*  cheering and laughing as Trump peddled lies [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=133.0s)]
*  and mocked the woman he was just found liable [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=136.0s)]
*  for sexually abusing and defaming, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=139.0s)]
*  by the way, completely predictable. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=141.0s)]
*  The network absolutely knew that would happen [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=144.0s)]
*  when they invited in that audience, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=146.0s)]
*  and that spectacle itself was just repugnant. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=148.0s)]
*  Now, we have seen a lot of reaction to the town hall [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=152.0s)]
*  over the last 25 hours, running the gamut [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=155.0s)]
*  from damning to defensive. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=157.0s)]
*  I will level with you here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=159.0s)]
*  I think most of the people defending the event [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=161.0s)]
*  are doing so disingenuously [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=163.0s)]
*  or because it's their job to do so, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=166.0s)]
*  or otherwise in their own interest. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=169.0s)]
*  Although there is one argument, I think, defending it [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=171.0s)]
*  that is not crazy at all. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=175.0s)]
*  We've heard a wide range of anti-Trump folks [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=176.0s)]
*  suggesting that that hour plus [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=178.0s)]
*  was an effective reminder for America [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=181.0s)]
*  of who the guy is, what this man is like, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=183.0s)]
*  and what a second Trump term would bring. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=186.0s)]
*  And advisor President Biden described it as, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=188.0s)]
*  quote, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=191.0s)]
*  It's simple, folks. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=192.0s)]
*  Do you want four more years of that? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=193.0s)]
*  If you don't, pitch in to our campaign. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=195.0s)]
*  Now, you know my position on this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=198.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is toxic, and he is unpopular. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=200.0s)]
*  A recent poll found his favorability rating [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=202.0s)]
*  had collapsed down to just 25%. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=204.0s)]
*  His obsession with the 2020 election [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=207.0s)]
*  is particularly alienating. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=209.0s)]
*  The vast majority of voters do not agree with him [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=212.0s)]
*  the election was stolen, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=214.0s)]
*  although you could argue that it was. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=215.0s)]
*  But the fact is that the majority of voters [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=217.0s)]
*  do not agree with him the election was stolen, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=219.0s)]
*  although you couldn't tell from who was in that room. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=221.0s)]
*  In fact, and this is key, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=224.0s)]
*  nearly 40% of Republican and Republican-leaning independents [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=225.0s)]
*  disagree with him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=229.0s)]
*  They think, correctly, that Joe Biden won fair and square in 2020. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=230.0s)]
*  And when the ex-president acts like an utter sociopath, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=235.0s)]
*  as he did last night, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=239.0s)]
*  I think it does not help him win over the swing voters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=241.0s)]
*  He will need to win the presidency [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=245.0s)]
*  should he secure the nomination. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=248.0s)]
*  As the Senate minority whip Republican John Thune put it, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=250.0s)]
*  quote, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=253.0s)]
*  it looks like a lot of Democratic campaign ads [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=254.0s)]
*  being written last night. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=256.0s)]
*  So that's an argument in defense that I don't think is disingenuous. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=258.0s)]
*  I don't think it's in bad faith. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=261.0s)]
*  I don't think it's people who are just doing it because they have to. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=262.0s)]
*  You could argue plausibly that showing America what it would be getting [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=265.0s)]
*  is bad for Trump's political prospects [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=269.0s)]
*  and therefore a good thing for the country. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=271.0s)]
*  But I think that's wrong for a core reason. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=275.0s)]
*  It's more fundamental than anything having to do with who it helps politically. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=278.0s)]
*  The core reason last night was bad [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=283.0s)]
*  is the simple, undeniable truth [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=286.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump attempted to end American democracy, that man. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=289.0s)]
*  He tried to destroy the foundational conceit of this country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=293.0s)]
*  It's the one we all celebrate, right, since the Revolution of 1776, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=297.0s)]
*  that the government is chosen by the people, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=301.0s)]
*  that we decide who rules over us, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=303.0s)]
*  that we are not ruled by a king nor a strongman. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=306.0s)]
*  That's kind of the whole thing, right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=310.0s)]
*  That's the soul of the American experiment. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=313.0s)]
*  Not only did he try to snuff that out, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=316.0s)]
*  he failed in doing so but wants to finish the job. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=320.0s)]
*  I cannot stress this strongly enough. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=325.0s)]
*  You did not need to watch the town hall last night to know that, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=328.0s)]
*  despite what people may say about making news. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=332.0s)]
*  His 2024 campaign, to those of us who have been observing above all else, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=335.0s)]
*  is a campaign to finish what he started on January 6, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=339.0s)]
*  to complete the sacking of the Capitol. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=344.0s)]
*  He will do that by any means necessary. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=347.0s)]
*  No one should have any illusions about this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=351.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to end American elections. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=354.0s)]
*  The unifying principle of his campaign is that he and his most fervent supporters [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=359.0s)]
*  should rule over this nation no matter how outnumbered they are. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=365.0s)]
*  That's it. That's the foundational platform. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=370.0s)]
*  He is not actually running for a second term. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=375.0s)]
*  He is running for a forever term. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=377.0s)]
*  As we saw on display in the audience last night, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=382.0s)]
*  represented there, there are tens of millions of our fellow citizens [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=385.0s)]
*  in the grip of, for lack of a better description, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=389.0s)]
*  a kind of psychosis and fealty to that vision. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=392.0s)]
*  That vision, which is that this minority of Americans should rule over everyone else [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=395.0s)]
*  through the instrument of Donald Trump, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=400.0s)]
*  that vision is an existential threat to the Union and to American democracy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=402.0s)]
*  Journalists who are protected by those constitutional principles, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=407.0s)]
*  who can only exist in a liberal democracy, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=412.0s)]
*  a constitutional republic with the First Amendment, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=414.0s)]
*  have a responsibility to preserve those foundational freedoms. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=417.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is simply, unquestionably an enemy of that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=421.0s)]
*  He is a candidate of disunion and of tyranny and insurrection. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=426.0s)]
*  He is in a different category than any other presidential candidate [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=432.0s)]
*  at least since the Civil War. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=436.0s)]
*  Of course, the problem with giving that man a stage [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=441.0s)]
*  and an audience braying in his favor, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=444.0s)]
*  more than an hour of national air time to make that pitch, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=448.0s)]
*  is that that view, I should rule, is not a view that can be debated. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=451.0s)]
*  He is being very clear about this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=459.0s)]
*  He is telling us he wants to destroy the Union. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=461.0s)]
*  He wants to complete the insurrection. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=465.0s)]
*  He wants to rule as a dictator. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=467.0s)]
*  That's what the 2020 stuff is. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=469.0s)]
*  That's what signing the backpack of the Jan Sixters about. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=471.0s)]
*  That is not a platform to debate or to rebut or to fact check. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=474.0s)]
*  It is a platform that simply must be defeated. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=479.0s)]
*  As far as I can tell, there were two reasons CNN did that town hall last night. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=485.0s)]
*  One is that CNN came under new ownership last year [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=489.0s)]
*  with the Warner Brothers discovery merger. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=491.0s)]
*  And that ushered in a new leader with David Zaslav running the operation, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=493.0s)]
*  particularly with a key shareholder who has Zaslav's ear. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=497.0s)]
*  That's John Malone. You see him there next to Zaslav. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=500.0s)]
*  Now, Malone is a member of Warner Brothers discovery boards, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=503.0s)]
*  and he's a conservative guy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=506.0s)]
*  He's a conservative billionaire Republican donor [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=507.0s)]
*  who donated $250,000 to Donald Trump's inaugural. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=510.0s)]
*  And if you read interviews with Malone [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=514.0s)]
*  and track both public statements from Zaslav and reporting, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=516.0s)]
*  it's quite clear the new ownership has an explicit ideological project. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=519.0s)]
*  They come out and say it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=524.0s)]
*  To make the network more Trump and Republican friendly. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=525.0s)]
*  And that ideological project is so strong that they will do that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=528.0s)]
*  even if, you know, that costs them viewers and revenue, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=532.0s)]
*  which it seems to have been doing recently. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=535.0s)]
*  Which brings us to their second reason for this town hall, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=538.0s)]
*  and believe me, I work in this business, I understand, ratings. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=541.0s)]
*  It is not a novel observation to say that there is a car crash quality to Donald Trump. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=545.0s)]
*  I saw it on social media last night. People hate watching. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=549.0s)]
*  He compels attention in spite of ourselves. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=552.0s)]
*  But here's the thing, even that is fading quite a bit. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=556.0s)]
*  Last night, 3 million people watched this event. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=560.0s)]
*  Now, that's a lot of people, but that's not a crazy number. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=563.0s)]
*  It is nothing like Trump would draw in 2016. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=566.0s)]
*  I mean, Tucker Carlson used to get on that typical Tuesday night before he got fired. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=569.0s)]
*  What is galling about the decision to do this Trump town hall, to me, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=573.0s)]
*  is the disingenuousness about the decision to do it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=578.0s)]
*  Today, CNN chairman Chris Licht wants you to believe that was journalism they did last night. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=581.0s)]
*  We made a lot of news, he says, and then quote, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=586.0s)]
*  America was served very well by what we did last night. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=588.0s)]
*  To state the obvious fact here, that wasn't journalism. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=592.0s)]
*  It's hard to imagine America was well served by hosting a nationally televised insurrection rally. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=596.0s)]
*  But the other thing is, there are ways to cover Donald Trump. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=601.0s)]
*  In fact, there are ways to interview him, which I certainly wouldn't object to, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=603.0s)]
*  that don't involve a live platform with hundreds of his whooping, cheering super fans [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=607.0s)]
*  ritualistically humiliating your host and network. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=613.0s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times, and she joins me now. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=618.0s)]
*  What did you think? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=624.0s)]
*  I mean, it was appalling. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=625.0s)]
*  And, you know, I think everybody thought it was going to be bad, and it was so much worse. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=626.0s)]
*  And I think it's the odd, what you zeroed in on. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=630.0s)]
*  The thing that made it particularly appalling was that you had this pro-Trump crowd, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=633.0s)]
*  and there was no need to do that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=637.0s)]
*  I think that, look, for better or worse, or not just for better or worse, for worse, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=639.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is the front runner for the Republican nomination. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=643.0s)]
*  He is a newsworthy figure. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=646.0s)]
*  I think it's worth interviewing him on the day after he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=648.0s)]
*  to find out what he has to say about that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=654.0s)]
*  But you don't need to do it in a kind of Trump rally format. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=657.0s)]
*  And the other thing that's so weird about that statement is that it's actually not journalism to make news. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=661.0s)]
*  It's journalism to cover news, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=667.0s)]
*  Not to kind of set up an event in which there's going to be, you know, kind of a lot of outreach reaction, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=669.0s)]
*  and then you can boast about driving the conversation. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=676.0s)]
*  I mean, the other thing I'll say is, and this, I think, relates to the ratings a little bit, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=679.0s)]
*  and people will say, well, people aren't paying close attention. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=683.0s)]
*  But, you know, I saw people say that part of the news was you say he refused to commit on pardoning the Jan Sixers. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=686.0s)]
*  Like, he said this, he's been saying this all over the place. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=692.0s)]
*  There was nothing new. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=695.0s)]
*  He doesn't say anything new. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=698.0s)]
*  He says the same thing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=699.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=700.0s)]
*  But I actually think there's sort of a mix, there's like a mixed thing there in that the fact that he's saying this stuff, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=701.0s)]
*  but he's not saying it on CNN and he's not saying it outside of the kind of right-wing ecosystem [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=707.0s)]
*  means that a lot of people have been able to put it to the side, to forget about it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=712.0s)]
*  And I think there is value in everybody being reminded of it, but you don't need to do it on such explicitly pro-Trump turf. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=716.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=723.0s)]
*  And I think this is actually where I think you and I agree that there is some real thorniness here about what to do about this sort of attention black hole. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=724.0s)]
*  And we've all sort of wrestled with it over eight years. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=730.0s)]
*  There's a certain school of thought, it shows up in my inbox and in my Twitter feed of like, don't play him at all. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=733.0s)]
*  Don't cover him. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=738.0s)]
*  It's the coverage that gives him power itself. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=739.0s)]
*  And I don't agree with that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=741.0s)]
*  Like, he's powerful because he says things like Republicans, the Republican base likes, which is where his power comes from. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=742.0s)]
*  So I think that like there's an overcorrection in the other direction. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=749.0s)]
*  You even said that the other day I thought was interesting about the E.G. Carroll thing, which is like the ex-president is being civilly tried for sexual abuse. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=753.0s)]
*  Like, it feels like it should be a bigger story. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=761.0s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=763.0s)]
*  I mean, it was so shocking to me, you know, when I was in the courthouse just that it wasn't that hard to get into the courthouse. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=764.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=770.0s)]
*  You know, there at one point I thought I was late. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=771.0s)]
*  So I went to the media overflow room, but there was nobody there because there was just still plenty of seats left. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=773.0s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, and I think part of that is that people, you know, didn't want they thought they they thought they knew everything that there was to know about that story. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=778.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=787.0s)]
*  The stories that we heard at that trial are mostly stories that we've heard before. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=788.0s)]
*  But again, I think that there's there's some real nuance here because I think Trump did lose some of his power. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=792.0s)]
*  Certainly it's kind of agenda setting power when he lost his Twitter account, when he lost his reach on social media. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=798.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. It does matter. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=804.0s)]
*  But it's not the totality of where he gets his political power from. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=805.0s)]
*  This is the quote, the sort of this is Chris Lick. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=810.0s)]
*  You don't have to like the former president's answers. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=815.0s)]
*  We can't say we didn't get them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=816.0s)]
*  Caitlin Preston again and again made news, made a lot of news. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=818.0s)]
*  And that is our job. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=821.0s)]
*  Again, I, you know, people can tell themselves whatever they need to get up in the morning. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=822.0s)]
*  But but it's also I mean, it does. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=827.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=829.0s)]
*  I do wonder what how are you going to deal with him as the nominee a second time if you were a mainstream news outlet? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=831.0s)]
*  And it really is an existential question. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=839.0s)]
*  Because like it's like the Wall Street Journal isn't going to cover both sides of the question of whether their journalists currently imprisoned in Russia should be in prison. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=843.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=852.0s)]
*  They have a very clear position, the correct one, which is that he's a hostage to the Russian state. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=853.0s)]
*  And it's like Donald Trump running for reelection to me is almost that clear for a press outlet. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=857.0s)]
*  And yeah. And I think that what you see coming from, you know, the sort of justification will we have to hear both sides. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=864.0s)]
*  There is a kind of brain dead rich guy centrism that is that that thinks that it is the sort of middle path between two ideologies, but is really an ideology in and of itself. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=870.0s)]
*  And so that kind of sort of like, oh, we have, you know, it kind of almost absolves them from having to make moral decisions about what to cover, as if the news was some sort of naturally occurring thing. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=880.0s)]
*  And at the same time, if you're a political reporter, you work at the New York Times newspaper, I dearly love an institution I dearly love or the Washington Post or a million other places. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=892.0s)]
*  You know, you can't write, you know, you're not going to every article isn't going to be a Chris Hayes opening monologue about how democracy is. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=901.0s)]
*  You got to write, you know, let me say this, like you would cover obviously what does Donald Trump say about E.G. and Carol. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=908.0s)]
*  I don't think that you would print all of his defamatory insults verbatim. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=913.0s)]
*  Right. Right. You don't kind of give him a platform in that way. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=917.0s)]
*  Right. And I think making those decisions is exactly the sort of that's where it gets like the minute decisions of what we, you know, even today, like what do we show and what don't we? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=920.0s)]
*  Those you're going to have to be making those decisions all the time. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=928.0s)]
*  Right. And what's frustrating, I feel like, is that they've sort of they've said it's not their responsibility to make those decisions at all. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=931.0s)]
*  Right. But making those decisions is what our job is. That's our job. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=936.0s)]
*  Michelle Goldberg. Always a pleasure. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=940.0s)]
*  Title 42, that is the obscure name for the covid error rule that blocks many asylum seekers from seeking refuge in this country. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=943.0s)]
*  It expires at midnight tonight. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=951.0s)]
*  And the move itself, Title 42, was the brainchild of Trump's anti-immigrant conciliary, Stephen Miller. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=953.0s)]
*  It was designed flatly as a pretext to block asylum seekers from entering the country under the thinly veiled guise of preventing the spread of covid. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=959.0s)]
*  With the rule expiring, we're effectively seeing a repeat of the same kinds of backlogs that covid created across our society when there was a huge amount of pent up demand for just about everything. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=968.0s)]
*  Except this time, it is asylum seekers and the backlog has been building for more than three years. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=978.0s)]
*  And the coverage of this looming change in the media has taken an almost apocalyptic tone. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=984.0s)]
*  It's a problem across the ideological spectrum, but one that is especially pronounced in right wing circles. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=989.0s)]
*  It all comes down to this. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=995.0s)]
*  Now less than 10 hours until Title 42 is officially, I think, in the past, opening the floodgates for an expected migrant surge at the southern border, escalating the years long crisis to levels that this country has never seen before. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=997.0s)]
*  Oh my God. The Fox countdown clock is a great reflection of the tone of their coverage. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1010.0s)]
*  They are trying to tap into the animal instincts in people's brains, showing videos of groups of desperate people crossing the border on an endless loop. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1017.0s)]
*  It is a specific genre of border coverage that says, look at this undifferentiated horde of aliens who are coming to invade your country. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1025.0s)]
*  And that obfuscates the fact that every single one of those people crossing over the border is a human being with a story of their own. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1036.0s)]
*  And most of those stories are about a long and dangerous journey to seek a better life free from violence, poverty and political repression. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1043.0s)]
*  Last night, Jose Diaz-Belart spoke to one woman who made the long and very dangerous journey from Venezuela to the U.S.-Mexico border, along with her husband, daughter and granddaughter. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1050.0s)]
*  Her husband was denied entry and she had to make the impossible decision to return to Venezuela with him, leaving her daughter and granddaughter behind to seek a better life here. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1060.0s)]
*  Why leave Venezuela? Why? Why leave Venezuela? You can't survive with the money one makes even to have food. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1070.0s)]
*  One month of work is enough for a little bit of sugar and a little bit of rice. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1077.0s)]
*  That's what it's for. A Venezuelan salary is to buy rice and flour. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1083.0s)]
*  How are you going to say goodbye? God will give me the strength. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1090.0s)]
*  At least I know that my granddaughter will have a better future here. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1099.0s)]
*  And one day, one day we'll be able to see each other again. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1106.0s)]
*  Fox and others will be working overtime this week to direct us to fear and hate people like that woman, those appearing at the southern border. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1112.0s)]
*  If you follow the news, you will undoubtedly hear about a wave or flood of migrants and lost in that fear mongering and smothered by those dehumanizing metaphors are tens of thousands of stories like that one you just heard. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3JfdW2hHho&t=1120.0s)]
