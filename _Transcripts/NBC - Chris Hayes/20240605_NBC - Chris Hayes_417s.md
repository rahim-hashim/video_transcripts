# 'Ticket to prison': Retired NYC judge weighs in on Trump sentencing
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M)
*  At some point in the next several weeks, Donald Trump is supposed to sit down with a New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=0.0s)]
*  City probation officer who will interview him, something all convicted felons are told [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=3.2s)]
*  to do. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=8.08s)]
*  The interview is typically, quote, a chance for the defendant to try to make a good impression [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=9.08s)]
*  and explain why he or she deserves a lighter punishment. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=12.34s)]
*  But Trump will likely have to tell the probation officer he has three other active indictments, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=15.58s)]
*  generally not a thing you want to tell your probation officer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=20.72s)]
*  Then based on the interview and things like Trump's employment, his propensity to reoffend, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=23.64s)]
*  which well, the probation officer will write a pre-sentence report with a recommendation [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=27.4s)]
*  in anticipation of the sentencing hearing currently scheduled for July 11. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=32.64s)]
*  A prison or jail sentence for felony falsification of business records, which Trump's been convicted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  of, is not common, we should be clear, for a first-time offender. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Citing his own research, lawyer Norm Eisen said, quote, in the most serious of these [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=46.64s)]
*  cases, about 10% of the total incarceration was imposed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=50.2s)]
*  But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=55.72s)]
*  It does happen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=57.0s)]
*  Here's just one example. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=58.0s)]
*  In 2015, a New York construction executive pleaded guilty to just one count of falsifying [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=59.0s)]
*  records as part of a bribery scheme. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=64.52s)]
*  He was sentenced to one year of partial imprisonment, spending Monday evenings through Wednesday [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=67.2s)]
*  mornings at Rikert Island Jail, but was free the other five days. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=71.0s)]
*  George Grasso is a retired New York City judge, 30-year veteran in the New York City Police [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=75.36s)]
*  Department. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=78.28s)]
*  He had a recent op-ed in The New York Times titled, I Supervise New York City Judges. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=79.28s)]
*  Juan Marchand put on a masterclass in the Trump trial, and he joins me now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=82.68s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  Great to be with you, George. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  So, the normal order of operations here is the person convicted sits down with the probation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  officer for an interview, and that probation officer writes up a memo. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  How do they come to their conclusions in that memo with a recommendation, and how important [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  is that, those recommendations in the sentencing default? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=102.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's called a pre-sentencing investigation and the report that follows from it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=105.0s)]
*  One thing you mentioned in the lead-up is the indictments he has pending. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=109.96s)]
*  I really don't think that should factor in at all, because he's presumed innocent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=115.0s)]
*  What could ultimately factor in… [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=120.72s)]
*  You don't think for a normal, a normal, for another person just convicted, if you're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=122.28s)]
*  like, I've got three active indictments, you don't think a probation officer would [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=126.32s)]
*  take those into account? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=129.48s)]
*  Well, I think it should, frankly, I think it should be presumed innocent. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=130.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=134.6s)]
*  You think they shouldn't take it into account? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=135.6s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=136.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=137.88s)]
*  Here's where his problem may lie with the other three indicted cases. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=138.88s)]
*  If he's convicted of any one of those cases, now he's got a conviction on this one, 34 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=142.04s)]
*  felony counts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=150.4s)]
*  So the convictions would certainly and must be taken into account. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=151.4s)]
*  That especially, you know, in the federal analysis, he's got the January 6 case, he's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=156.44s)]
*  got the falsified document case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=161.04s)]
*  These 34 New York felony counts that he now stands convicted of could be a ticket to prison [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=163.4s)]
*  on those counts or certainly a strong factor. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=170.72s)]
*  What they're going to be looking at here is, does he show a sense of accountability? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=173.32s)]
*  Does he show a sense of remorse? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=178.52s)]
*  He's pretty much already answered those questions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=180.2s)]
*  I mean, we've all heard his kind of semi-crazed, I'm going to say in my opinion, semi-crazed [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=182.44s)]
*  public statements out of Trump Tower on Friday where he continues to unfairly, evidence-free [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=188.68s)]
*  blasting of the judge in the entire system. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=196.28s)]
*  So we know how that's going to go. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=198.72s)]
*  But something that I think will and should be looked at very seriously when the probation [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=200.48s)]
*  officer prepares the pre-sentencing report to the judge, which the judge is required [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=206.96s)]
*  to consider but not necessarily abide by. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=213.12s)]
*  It's the judge that makes the sentencing decision. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=215.96s)]
*  It's the seriousness of the conviction. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=218.88s)]
*  And you talked about Norm Eisen's study, and it's not unheard of that people can go to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=222.32s)]
*  jail in cases like this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=228.32s)]
*  But all things being equal, they will also be considering, as they must. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=230.04s)]
*  Here we have a 77-year-old defendant, no prior record, nonviolent e-felony, maximum incarceration [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=233.04s)]
*  time four years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=241.04s)]
*  That will all weigh and should weigh in favor of the defendant, Defendant Trump in this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  case, now convicted defendant. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=247.28s)]
*  However, the seriousness in this case I think is rather unique in terms of just how usually [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=249.72s)]
*  these are like, they're falsifying business records to get out of paying some taxes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=256.4s)]
*  They're skimming money off the top, accountants working together. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=261.79999999999995s)]
*  Inherent in the falsification, the connecting charge here was a violation of New York election [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=267.56s)]
*  law, the essence of which two or more individuals engage in a conspiracy in order to obtain [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=272.76s)]
*  the election, prevent someone from being elected, or get someone elected. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=281.44s)]
*  And in this point, it was get someone elected. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=285.0s)]
*  Who were the conspirators in this case? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=287.48s)]
*  Who were the two or more? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=289.64s)]
*  Donald Trump, David Pecker, Michael Cohen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=291.16s)]
*  So that election charge, that's the felony bump-up charge. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=294.92s)]
*  Like in the case when we talked about the construction guy, it was bribery. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=299.36s)]
*  He was in furtherance of a bribery. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=301.92s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=303.8s)]
*  So that means the unanimous jury found falsification of business records and the violation of New [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=304.8s)]
*  York election law. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=311.68s)]
*  That's called the essence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=312.68s)]
*  My view of that is that's called corrupting an election, corrupting a presidential election. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=314.96s)]
*  By the way, not corrupting a presidential election where Donald Trump in 2016 beat Hillary Clinton [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=321.56s)]
*  in the landslide. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=328.44s)]
*  It was a squeaker. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=329.82s)]
*  I believe roughly Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan with a total of 80,000 votes. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  Now the essence of the conviction is it was to ensure that the Stormy's Daniels story [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=338.48s)]
*  wouldn't break in the last two weeks of October, right on the heels of the Access Hollywood [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=345.56s)]
*  tape. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=351.48s)]
*  And by the way, at the same time, Hillary Clinton was getting hit with the Comey investigation, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=352.48s)]
*  reopening and then closing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=358.24s)]
*  So your point being it's arguably despot. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=360.24s)]
*  It was a foul little mix. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  But what is clear here, we will never know. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=364.72s)]
*  If Trump won because of that, but we will know that he's convicted of 34 felony counts [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=367.88s)]
*  that in essence corrupted the election in New York, in New York state, a presidential [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=374.88s)]
*  election in my judgment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=380.68s)]
*  That's about a serious, a serious aversion of falsification of business records being [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=383.48s)]
*  bumped up to a felony, as I'm aware of. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=389.0s)]
*  That's very well said, George Grasso. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=392.6s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG3cUWK_s_M&t=395.71999999999997s)]
