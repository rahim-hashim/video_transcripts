# ‘Brainworms’ GOP lawmaker mistakes NCAA team for ‘illegal invaders’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk)
*  If you're wondering how far the brain worms have penetrated the minds of some Republicans, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=0.0s)]
*  look no further than what happened in Michigan this week, where an eagle-eyed state representative [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=4.28s)]
*  named Matt Maddock thinks he spotted the latest frontier in the right-wing horror fantasy [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=8.52s)]
*  of a migrant invasion in the United States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=13.34s)]
*  Maddock posted these pictures of three buses lined up near an airplane at the Detroit Metro [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=16.04s)]
*  Airport Wednesday night, writing frantically, happening right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=22.2s)]
*  Three buses just loaded up with illegal invaders at Detroit Metro. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=26.34s)]
*  Anyone have any idea where they're headed with their police escort? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=30.1s)]
*  Yes, Matt Maddock was sounding the alarm, because when he sees a bus or a three at an [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=33.42s)]
*  airport, it must be an invasion. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=38.68s)]
*  His post was of course reposted by the equally sharp chairman of the Michigan Republican [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=41.42s)]
*  Party. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=46.78s)]
*  But, and who could see this coming, the buses were not filled with invaders. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=47.78s)]
*  They were filled with bulldogs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=52.06s)]
*  The Gonzaga Bulldogs, to be precise. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=54.56s)]
*  Yes, as you can see in the tweets from the Gonzaga men's basketball team, that was them [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=56.86s)]
*  triumphantly arriving in Detroit to play in the NCAA Sweet 16 matchup at Little Caesar's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=62.34s)]
*  Arena tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=68.06s)]
*  There's a completely embarrassing, humiliating level of paranoia on display here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=70.7s)]
*  You might think a normal person might declare an oopsie and take down the post, like the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  chair of the party eventually did, or, heaven forbid, one could apologize. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=78.5s)]
*  But Matt Maddock, an actual elected person in the state of Michigan, has not only left [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=82.66s)]
*  the post up, it is still there right now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=86.66s)]
*  But to anyone who's pointed out his racist and offensive error, Maddock explains himself [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=88.9s)]
*  with variations of sure commie and okay commie. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=93.78s)]
*  I'm joined now by one of Maddock's Democratic colleagues in the Michigan legislature, State [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=98.34s)]
*  Senator Mallory McMorrow. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=102.3s)]
*  Senator, it was your pointing this out that brought me to this story. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=105.5s)]
*  How quickly do people sniff out the actual story here? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=111.54s)]
*  Almost immediately. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=116.62s)]
*  I mean, it would be hilarious if this weren't an actual elected official, but this isn't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=118.34s)]
*  the first time he's done this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  You have people like Maddock now frantically driving around the state looking for any bus [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  as a sign of a threat. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=133.14s)]
*  We saw this happen in Florida. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=134.77999999999997s)]
*  A woman posted a video following a line of yellow school buses asking questions about [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=135.77999999999997s)]
*  where these people were going, and it was runners going to a 10K. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=141.82s)]
*  It's just like, how do you live in this paranoid universe where every single bus is a threat [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  instead of a basketball team? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=151.66s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  I've watched, I was looking at some data the other day on the number one issue for Republican [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  voters, and it's also been independent voters. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=160.94s)]
*  One thing that's really interesting is the economy was the number one issue when people [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=164.26s)]
*  were frustrated with it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=167.54s)]
*  But interestingly enough, it has come down precipitously for Republicans and even for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=169.26s)]
*  independents as the number one issue being replaced by immigration, and it really does [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=174.5s)]
*  feel like a bait and switch. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=177.82s)]
*  I'm curious from your position in Michigan, key battleground state and also a place that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=179.1s)]
*  was hit very hard in the Great Recession, had a very contentious experience with COVID. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=184.26s)]
*  Do you feel like there's an active desire on the part of Republican colleagues to just [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=189.94s)]
*  swap out what the sort of source and focus of their anger is? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=194.66s)]
*  I mean, I think part of that is right, and I think also just look no further than Donald [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=202.54s)]
*  Trump to see where this issue is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=207.34s)]
*  I mean, there was a bipartisan immigration reform bill in front of Congress that had [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  wide agreement until Trump called GOP members of Congress and said, don't vote it through [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=216.74s)]
*  because we can't give Biden a win. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=222.38s)]
*  So, I mean, frankly, it's just really disgusting that they would rather have this be a talking [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=224.34s)]
*  point and a political weapon than to actually solve the issue. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=230.82000000000002s)]
*  And then what happens is you're afraid of everything. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, what's going to happen when there is a group of fourth graders coming to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  our state capitol on a field trip and we have some nut job, run them off the road, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=241.94s)]
*  because they believe all of these lies, because the Republicans don't want to be bothered [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  with actual solutions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=252.46s)]
*  Yeah, I should note that the polling from Michigan shows immigration and the economy [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=254.78s)]
*  tied along with preserving democracy is three of the top issues. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=258.82s)]
*  Also, Maddox got sort of a history with Trump as one of the kind of key like Trump whisperers [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=264.14s)]
*  or liaisons in the state. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=271.34s)]
*  This reporting from the Huffington Post in twenty twenty two that Republicans from this [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=272.7s)]
*  from your state say there's only one way to get the former president's attention. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=278.73999999999995s)]
*  That's to know and support Michigan GOP co-chair Maddox, her state representative husband, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=282.5s)]
*  Matt Maddox and their adult children who are involved in varying degrees of the couple's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=287.46s)]
*  political endeavors. These are not, to the point, fringe characters in the Michigan [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=291.34s)]
*  Republican GOP. This isn't just like grabbing some rando. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=295.82s)]
*  This is someone with real power in that state's party. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=299.78s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Mishawn Maddox is currently under investigation as one of the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=303.14s)]
*  false electors here in Michigan, and she was previously the co-chair of the state party. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=307.85999999999996s)]
*  So this is somebody who's heavily involved, somebody who Donald Trump has their personal [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=312.82s)]
*  phone numbers and calls them regularly to interfere in our elections and to kind of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  seed these chaotic issues. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=321.94s)]
*  This isn't the fringe. This is the GOP right now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=324.85999999999996s)]
*  And I think to your point about issues that matter to Michiganders, it's the economy, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=328.1s)]
*  immigration and democracy, because Michigan is a state where I think people see what's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  happening and want to know that this election isn't going to be our last election and we're [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=337.70000000000005s)]
*  going to have a chance to vote after this year. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=341.94s)]
*  I was struck by the fact that the new chair of the GOP, Chair Hoekstra, who won this sort [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=346.42s)]
*  of civil war battle against the kind of extremely nutty, if I can say that, MAGA wing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=353.42s)]
*  But it was just there's something about him being the sane, reasonable one who won that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=359.94s)]
*  civil war and then retweeting this utterly paranoid tweet said a lot to me about what [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  kind of hands the state GOP is in. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=371.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. It's not only that he retweeted it, but who he retweeted it from. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, Michon Matic walked so Christina Caramo, the previous chair of the Michigan [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=379.94s)]
*  GOP, could run. And Caramo is the one who accused Beyonce and just about everything [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=384.78s)]
*  else of being satanic. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=389.82s)]
*  So, you know, Hoekstra won on this idea of returning the party to sanity, but he's still [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=391.78s)]
*  looking to the Maddox as kind of his Trump whisperer. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=397.46s)]
*  And that's a bad sign for the GOP. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=402.02s)]
*  I love the eyes emoji, like not saying it's true or not, just looking at the buses of the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=405.18s)]
*  Gonzaga Bulldogs men's team, State Senator Mallory McMorrow. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=413.62s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=415.86s)]
*  Get or the cloud icon and enjoy it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NSY02dEIk&t=439.66s)]
