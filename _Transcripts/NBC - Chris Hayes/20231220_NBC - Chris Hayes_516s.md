# The history of the insurrection clause—and why it ‘plainly’ applies to Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Colorado Republicans are publicly threatening to change how they vote for presidential nominees in light of yesterday's decision by the state Supreme Court in Colorado to bar Trump from the primary ballot under the 14th amendment the US Constitution. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=0.0s)]
*  The state GOP now saying it may begin the legally fraught process of switching from a primary to a caucus in order to allow its members to still cast their votes for Trump next March. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=16.0s)]
*  As of now, that mostly just seems like posturing to be honest. But for all of the controversy, when you go back to the relevant text used to raise the challenge, section three, the 14th amendment, it really does stand out as pretty darn fitting. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=26.0s)]
*  Quote, no person shall hold any office under the United States, who having previously taken an oath as an officer of the United States to support the Constitution, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=41.0s)]
*  You cannot hold government office if you are an insurrectionist or you supported insurrectionists. It's quite clear, quite simple, especially when you consider the amendment within the historical context of its ratification. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=58.0s)]
*  But this decision from the Colorado Supreme Court yesterday still came as a shock, surprise. And that's largely, I think, because of the ways in which American legal culture has grown to emphasize, even fetishize some parts of the Constitution and its founding, while largely ignoring others. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=72.0s)]
*  Around the 1980s, the American right embraced the judicial philosophy of originalism, thanks in large part to late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Basically, it's the idea that we should interpret the Constitution only as its founders intended and as people understood it at the time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=91.0s)]
*  To be clear, this was always a reactionary project, often undertaken in transparently bad faith, used to reverse engineer the right's preferred political outcomes and discarded when it didn't fit their agenda. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=109.0s)]
*  But originalism remains a de facto legal theory of the American conservative movement and honestly the 6-3 Trump Court. And it remains enormously effective as a rhetorical tool because it taps into our shared civic religion of reverence for our founders. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=121.0s)]
*  With that in mind, then, I think it's worth looking at the history of the Reconstruction Amendments, which were ratified with the hope of refounding the country after the Civil War without the stain of slavery following the horrible carnage of that war. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=137.0s)]
*  When it was over, 600,000 men had perished. But the Union held and the Constitution, like the nation, was reborn. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=152.0s)]
*  The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments together, but above all the 14th Amendment, is the fruit of the Civil War. It is what all those brave men fought for and died for. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=162.0s)]
*  This is from a PBS documentary about the war. These Amendments, particularly the 14th Amendment, guaranteeing equal protection, completely and utterly transformed the structure of American government. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=176.0s)]
*  The legal ramifications of the 14th Amendment give rise to everything we think of as the modern state and pluralistic, multiracial democracy. It is impossible to overstate just how important it is to our current understanding of what America is and of constitutional law. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=186.0s)]
*  And yet, its founding, the second founding of the country, the founding Amendments after the war, the Reconstruction Amendments, is basically lost to history. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=200.0s)]
*  Its drafters are not household names, like the men who drafted Bill Wrights. And there's a reason for that. Those men were political radicals. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=210.0s)]
*  The people who drafted the Reconstruction Amendments were the vanguard of radicalism, in fact, who, after defeating the traitorous, insurrectionist slave power of the South, forced them at gunpoint into a participatory, multiracial democracy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=218.0s)]
*  Over the past 150 years, there has been an effort not to reckon with that uncompromising fact. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=233.0s)]
*  That said, if you're going to take an originalist perspective here, that history is pretty important. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=240.0s)]
*  The 14th Amendment was indeed a bold act of raw political power in furtherance of that project of multiracial democracy, and it should be interpreted as such. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=245.0s)]
*  And the person most responsible for recovering that fundamental reality of our country's second founding and the constitutional provisions it created is Supreme Court Justice Katanji Brown Jackson. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=255.0s)]
*  Time and again, she has argued we cannot ignore the radical origins or radical meaning of the 14th Amendment, nor its original intention as a protector of marginalized people in the face of state oppression. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=265.0s)]
*  This has been especially apparent when she talks about things like affirmative action and voting rights. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=277.0s)]
*  At that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the Framers themselves adopted the Equal Protection Clause, the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment in a race-conscious way. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=294.0s)]
*  The entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=306.0s)]
*  The legislator who introduced that amendment said that, quote, unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=312.0s)]
*  And crush to death the hated freedmen. That's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=324.0s)]
*  No, it's sure not. And the reason that I'm going on this long preamble of history is because this all brings us back to Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=334.0s)]
*  The people that wrote that amendment understood that the insurrectionist self and the people that had led it insurrection were an existential threat to the preserved union. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=342.0s)]
*  That those who took up arms against their own government, who betrayed it, on behalf of slavery, those who remained committed to that cause must be eradicated from the government forever or the union would perish. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=354.0s)]
*  And they were radicals about that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=367.0s)]
*  In fact, the current version of Section 3, that's the compromise version. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=369.0s)]
*  The original more extreme version of the text would have barred all former Confederates from participating in democracy at all for a number of years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=374.0s)]
*  One founder of the amendment, radical Republican legend Thaddeus Stevens, said that even that would have been, quote, too lenient. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=380.0s)]
*  So now here we are in 2023, faced with the plain meaning of the text written by these lost and forgotten founders whose vision of the country was a radical vision of multiracial oppression. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=387.0s)]
*  A vision of equality for men. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=399.0s)]
*  And this majority in Colorado takes an originalist framework when they argue that Donald Trump, the ultimate modern insurrectionist who led an armed mob against the American government, must too be never allowed to hold office again, just like his Confederate predecessors. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=402.0s)]
*  Particularly when it comes to defining what exactly constitutes an office in the United States, which was the exact originalist argument the plaintiffs made when they argued in front of the court that Trump should be ineligible. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=417.0s)]
*  The Constitution tells us over and over that the presidency is an office and that the person who holds it swears an oath of office before assuming the execution of his office. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=429.0s)]
*  And the plain meaning of an officer is just one who holds an office. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=442.0s)]
*  So we think the text here is very clear that the history supports it and certainly that the core purpose of the provision supports that reading as well. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=447.0s)]
*  And I have to say after years of hypocrisy with so-called originalists arguing the First Amendment protects everything from unlimited dark money in our politics, the Second Amendment gives you the right to own military grade weapons detached from the first rather sizable clause in that amendment. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=456.0s)]
*  There is something so satisfying about seeing originalism weaponize as a force for good for multiracial democracy and equality. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=470.0s)]
*  The ex-president engaged in insurrection against the United States. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=479.0s)]
*  The Constitution says he is not qualified for office as a result. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=482.0s)]
*  That is the plain truth of the matter and a straightforward reading of the law. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=485.0s)]
*  Now watch all the conservative originalists on the Supreme Court run away from it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=490.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJY7aQUUghA&t=515.0s)]
