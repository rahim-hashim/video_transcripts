# ‘He...wants to kill our kids’ Sen. Murphy warns of deadly consequences of RFK Jr. pick
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc)
*  Brand new Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota spared the kind of theatrics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=0.0s)]
*  that Speaker Mike Johnson had to endure today, even though he was not the MAGA pick for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=4.24s)]
*  job. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=8.84s)]
*  That title belonged to Senator Rick Scott of Florida. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=9.84s)]
*  He ran as Trump's sledgehammer. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=12.0s)]
*  He was endorsed by incoming co-president Elon Musk. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=13.8s)]
*  But Senate Republicans rejected him in their leadership elections last November. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=17.36s)]
*  They instead picked Thune, Senate Republican whip, who's a pretty close ally of the outgoing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=20.88s)]
*  leader Mitch McConnell. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=25.2s)]
*  Republicans now have a 53 to 47 majority in the Senate, which is slim, but nowhere near [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=27.32s)]
*  as narrow as the House. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=31.92s)]
*  They do still have to contend with a lot of the same internal politics and factions as [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=34.64s)]
*  every other Republican coalition under Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=38.7s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy is a Democrat from Connecticut, part of the Democratic leadership team as [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=41.44s)]
*  the deputy conference secretary. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=45.16s)]
*  Today he was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, you see him there, to serve his third [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  term in the U.S. Senate after being elected by the people of Connecticut last year, and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=52.18s)]
*  he joins me now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=56.12s)]
*  Senator, good to have you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=57.12s)]
*  Hey, how are you? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm good. Congrats on term three. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=61.08s)]
*  You you out, I think you outran the top of the ticket by more than any other Democrat, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=63.36s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken, or you were thinking the top two or three. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=67.72s)]
*  I think I've spoken to you about why why that was. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=70.84s)]
*  How are you thinking about you and the Democrats posture going into this Congress? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=73.4s)]
*  How is it maybe different from 2016? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=79.68s)]
*  Is it different? What are your thoughts? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=81.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, we're the opposition party. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=83.64s)]
*  We are in the minority in the House and the Senate. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=87.28s)]
*  We don't have the White House. And so our job is, A, to make sure everybody [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=89.28s)]
*  understands what's going on right now. And it is a wholesale takeover of the United States [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=94.16s)]
*  government by the billionaire and corporate class. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=98.4s)]
*  We are turning into an oligarchy as we speak. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=100.64s)]
*  And second, to raise the alarms on what is a really dangerous assault on democracy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=103.32s)]
*  that has been underway since the election and will continue after the inauguration. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=108.48s)]
*  It's just not hyperbole to suggest that we might be looking at Democrats being locked up, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=113.36s)]
*  media companies being shut down by this new administration sometime in the spring. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=118.08s)]
*  So, listen, I'm all for rebuilding the Democratic Party. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=124.48s)]
*  I certainly have thoughts on how we can become a much more aggressively economically [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=126.88s)]
*  populist party that reaches out to folks who had been duped by Donald Trump into thinking [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=130.52s)]
*  that he was the economic populist. But let's be honest, Democrats are going to pass anything [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=136.56s)]
*  in the next two years. So we've got to make sure everybody in this country understands [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=141.52s)]
*  what the Republicans are trying to do. That is to steal your money, cutting things like [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=146.0s)]
*  Medicaid and Medicare in order to finance another giveaway to billionaires and corporations. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=150.8s)]
*  That is the beginning and the end of the Republican agenda. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=156.08s)]
*  And that's what Democrats have to talk about. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=158.32s)]
*  Well, and to me, the most salient new development in all this is the Musk factor, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=160.24s)]
*  which genuinely strikes me as new. It wasn't a factor in 2017. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=165.6s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen anything like it in the 20 years I've covered American politics. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=170.32s)]
*  Truly, I can't come up with anything, any precedent, any analog to the world's richest man [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  who spent a quarter of a billion dollars. And when there's a shutdown fight in Congress, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=180.72s)]
*  the speaker is calling two guys, the guy you see on the right of your screen and the guy you see [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=184.96s)]
*  on the left. It just hasn't happened. And I wonder what that means for how you think about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=189.44s)]
*  opposition, particularly along the lines you're just describing about this billionaire takeover. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, listen, this isn't spin, right? It is just true that Musk is the co-president. That's maybe a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  charitable interpretation. He may be more powerful than Donald Trump. And the fact of the matter is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=206.32s)]
*  Musk is trying to get close to the White House because he makes his billions off of government [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  policy. He makes tons of money off of production in China. So he wants to manage the relationship [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=216.72s)]
*  in China so that he can continue to make lots of money. And the car subsidies and the rocket [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=222.56s)]
*  subsidies that come through the federal government are a big deal to him as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=227.76s)]
*  So he is a perfect example of a number of oligarchs, of billionaires, of corporate titans [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=231.92s)]
*  who are surrounding Trump in order to steal from ordinary Americans, right? Cut our benefits, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  our kids' education, our grandparents' health care in order to turn a billionaire into a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=245.92s)]
*  multi-billionaire. And Musk is well known, but he stands there as a perfect example for the American [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=252.88s)]
*  public as to what is fundamentally wrong with the Trump administration, how it is going to be [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=259.44s)]
*  an oligarchy, a kleptocracy. Call it what you will, but it's just in service of the billionaire [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=264.96s)]
*  class. On the nominees, which will be one of the first big fights. And obviously there was [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=270.4s)]
*  already a defeat for the incoming president, Matt Gaetz. Even Senate Republicans said, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=274.4s)]
*  what are you joking? You know, John Thune, I think some of these are winnable battles. I don't know. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=278.88000000000005s)]
*  I'm not doing the vote counting, but you know, you got to get four to your side. And I think the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=284.48s)]
*  notion of Cash Patel as FBI director is like obviously ludicrous and dangerous. Here's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=288.72s)]
*  the Senate Majority Leader Thune talking about those nominees. Take a listen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Does that mean you already know some of your Republican senators won't vote to confirm [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=298.56s)]
*  Cash Patel at the FBI or Pete Hagseth at the Pentagon? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  We don't have at this point, I don't think clarity on that. I think these are nominees [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=306.16s)]
*  who are new enough. They've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  frankly, have gone very well, but they still have to make their case in front of the committee. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  It seems to me like the hearings are real, right? That senators and the American public should [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  take them as real and these are not as foregone conclusions. Is that how you approach this? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=324.16s)]
*  Yeah, I do see these nominations as winnable fights, but Democrats have to fight the fights. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=328.8s)]
*  And frankly, Chris, I don't see that happening across the Capitol right now. I mean, I've been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=336.72s)]
*  talking ad nauseam about how Cash Patel is being put into the FBI, literally to destroy the rule [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=342.08s)]
*  of law, to enable Trump's dream to put his political opponents in jail. Why are we giving [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=348.0s)]
*  RFK Jr. a pass? Okay, he wants to ban pharmaceutical advertising. That's nice. He also wants to kill [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=355.36s)]
*  our kids by withdrawing vaccines from our schools and taking fluoride out of our drinking water. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=361.2s)]
*  I mean, Democrats have to fight these nominees and not just like once a week, every day, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  because the only way that Republicans even consider voting against them is if the temperature has [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=373.2s)]
*  been turned up all across the country. And I just worry that we are not working the way we need to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=377.92s)]
*  work against a nominee slate that is just absolutely bonkers and out of the American [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=383.84s)]
*  mainstream by a million miles. That's fair characterization, Senator Chris Murphy. Thank you very much. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEd-C1-hiVc&t=389.52s)]
