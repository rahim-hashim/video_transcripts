# Maxwell Frost rips new Florida curriculum as bid to ‘erase Black history’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o)
*  Today, on what would have been Emmett Till's 82nd birthday, President Joe Biden signed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=0.0s)]
*  a proclamation designating a national monument to the murdered teenager and his mother. Till [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=5.4s)]
*  was 14 years old in 1955 when he was tortured and murdered in Mississippi over accusations [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=10.64s)]
*  of whistling at a white woman. Till's mother, as the president noted, insisted on an open [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=16.0s)]
*  casket funeral, a decision that helped to galvanize the civil rights movement. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=20.68s)]
*  The monument includes a bulletproof memorial sign where Till's body was found, installed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=25.64s)]
*  in 2019 after previous markers were shot up. Unfortunately, in 2023, the president could [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=29.92s)]
*  not simply mark the death of Till and the role it played in this in sparking the civil [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=36.68s)]
*  rights movement, because today, nearly 70 years later, there's an effort to erase history, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  to paper over the bad and the truth of our nation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  While darkness and denialism can hide much, they erase nothing. They can hide, but they [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=52.6s)]
*  erase nothing. We can't just choose to learn what we want to know. We have to learn what [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=60.04s)]
*  we should know. We should know about our country. We should know everything, the good, the bad, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=66.92s)]
*  the truth of who we are as a nation. That's what great nations do. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=73.12s)]
*  Look, telling the truth and the full history of our nation is important. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=78.96s)]
*  We can't just choose to learn what we want to know. We have to learn what we should know. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  One glaring example of a state that is actively trying to bury what we should know as a part [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  of American history is Florida, where the State Board of Education just approved a new [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  educational curriculum, boosted by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who awkwardly defends [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=103.2s)]
*  his state's new guidelines while simultaneously pretending he has nothing to do with them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=109.04s)]
*  I didn't do it and I wasn't involved in it, but I think what they're doing is I think that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=115.2s)]
*  they're probably going to show some of the folks that eventually parlayed being a blacksmith into [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=120.4s)]
*  doing things later in life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=129.44s)]
*  Joining me now is Congressman Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat. Congressman, there's a lot we [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=133.12s)]
*  could talk about on the politics here and Ron DeSantis, but I do want to start with just what [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  this means because often this is shorthanded as a political issue and it has real consequences in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=143.12s)]
*  Florida. So how will the changes in the educational curriculum impact students in the state? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=147.52s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on. It's going to have a big impact on students in the state, but you know, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=156.24s)]
*  we're going to be fighting against that with amazing leaders across the entire state that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=160.0s)]
*  won't stand for this. Not only do they want to erase black history and American history, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=164.16s)]
*  they want to change it. And there's a reason why. Last election, 70% of Gen Z voted for Democrats. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=169.28s)]
*  And so I think Republicans, especially this new neo-fascist movement growing in the country, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=176.56s)]
*  realizes that young people voting poses an existential threat to the far-right-wing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=181.44s)]
*  Republican Party. And so what they want to do, Jen, is they want to change education so they can [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=187.36s)]
*  change the mindset of a generation. But little do they know, not only is that not going to work, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=192.24s)]
*  it's just going to piss us off. It's going to drive people to the polls. It's going to drive [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  people to organize. And we won't let it happen in our state. You sound pretty pissed off, which I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  appreciate and value. Now, I know you sent a letter. I assume you haven't heard back, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=207.36s)]
*  but tell me if you have. But what can you actually do to change the curriculum? You're going to get [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  people activated, get Gen Z pissed off. Many are. What can you do to change it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=216.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, we've sent many letters in my seven-month tenure as a member of Congress. I've heard [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=223.6s)]
*  back from none of them. All these letters have been to the governor's office or the state cabinet. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=229.28s)]
*  I've never heard back from them. They have no interest in speaking with us. They have no [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=234.4s)]
*  interest in speaking with the people. The governor never hosts any town halls or wants to speak with [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=237.76s)]
*  constituents. That's why I had to interrupt one of the speeches just about a year and a half ago [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=241.84s)]
*  during my campaign to learn about his plan to help kids stop dying in classrooms. But what can [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=246.0s)]
*  we do? We can organize. We can ensure that we're electing good candidates. We can fight back, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=251.12s)]
*  send letters, protest to the State Board of Education to say, we demand actual education, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=255.68s)]
*  not a whitewashed version of education that seemingly wants to make our kids okay with [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=262.08s)]
*  slavery and white supremacy. That's a problem. And it's not what the Republican Party was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=268.16s)]
*  founded on at all. And again, it's this problem we're seeing in the state of Florida where we [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  have Republican leaders who want to manufacture an issue, then say, I'm the hero here. If you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=278.64s)]
*  give me more power, I'll deal with it. And we've seen authoritarian leaders do this before. It's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  in the playbook and we have to fight against it. So we'll continue to do it. We're going to take [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=288.64s)]
*  it to the school boards. We're going to take it to the state and we're going to fight for actual [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=291.76s)]
*  education. It's not about a left-wing education or white-wing education. It's about the real history [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  of this country. Speaking of activism, and you've been very active on a number of issues, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=301.12s)]
*  you've been very supportive of your Texas colleague, Greg Caesar, in the thirst strike [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=305.76s)]
*  that he took part in today on the Capitol steps. First of all, have you checked in with him? How is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=310.72s)]
*  he doing? Yeah, Greg is doing great. I actually saw him at the end of it when we just had votes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=315.04s)]
*  And, you know, Greg, you look at someone like Greg, and this is the reason why it's important [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=323.2s)]
*  to send organizers to Congress. Texas has been having a huge problem with workers dying on the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=327.12s)]
*  job because they don't have access to water. They're not given breaks. And there's really [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  something that the federal government can do here to step in and protect workers. So Greg, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=337.6s)]
*  today, since the morning, has been on a thirst strike in the hot sun on the Capitol steps to show [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  just a little bit of what the workers are going through in Texas and also across the nation. So I [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=346.72s)]
*  joined him for about an hour because it's a problem everywhere. And this is why we got to elect [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=351.12s)]
*  organizers who are going to, of course, hold our leaders accountable, but as themselves as leaders, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=355.2s)]
*  will show that they're in solidarity with the people. So I'm honored to serve with my brother, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=360.24s)]
*  Greg Casar, and he's doing amazing work in Texas and for the country. I also wanted to ask you about [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=363.76s)]
*  the climate. I know you've been very outspoken on this crisis as well. July is the hottest month [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=369.2s)]
*  on record, I believe, if I'm getting my facts straight there. There's been activism among [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=374.88s)]
*  young people. It's still a partisan issue, though, somehow. How do you change that? And [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=380.32s)]
*  how are you making, how are you building bridges on that front? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  You know what's interesting? I actually just had a conversation this morning with Senator Ed Markey [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=391.52s)]
*  about this, and he was talking about the fact that the climate crisis is becoming such a problem [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=396.08s)]
*  to now every sector of society in Massachusetts, that he has big, big business owners, which I think [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=401.28s)]
*  typically folks wouldn't see them as allies in the climate crisis, coming to him and saying, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=407.12s)]
*  we need to do something about this. It's now hurting my bottom line. Unfortunately, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=411.36s)]
*  that's what a lot of people just care about. But hey, welcome to the fight nonetheless. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  And we see the same thing in the state of Florida. As the hurricanes get longer and worse because of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=419.52s)]
*  the climate crisis, as it is continuing to decimate entire towns and cities in the state of Florida, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=425.2s)]
*  I think we have a rude awakening upon us. And what I want to tell people is the climate crisis [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=431.52s)]
*  is here. It's happening. We see it happening every day across the country. However, we can still [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=436.24s)]
*  prevent the worst impact of it. And so we have a lot of work to do on it. But I think, Jen, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  unfortunately, you know, there are consequences coming and that are here. And I think that will [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=446.72s)]
*  shake a lot of people and put people in action. But again, the good news is we still have time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=451.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbHcd4b53o&t=466.24s)]
