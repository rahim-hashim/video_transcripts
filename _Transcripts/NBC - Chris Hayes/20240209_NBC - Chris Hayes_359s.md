Video Description: When Curtis Sliwa and the Guardian Angels attacked a "migrant shoplifter" live on Fox News, it fit perfectly with the right's narrative about "illegals" and "rampant crime." Except after the cameras turned off, a little more reporting and digging revealed the truth.

# Fox News fearmongering backfires on live TV
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc)
*  You cannot overstate how much vile demagoguery about migrants constantly appears on Fox News day in day out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a government jobs program that lets in more migrants. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=8.0s)]
*  Not to mention how much we're paying for the migrants' kids to go to school. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=11.0s)]
*  But now the migrants are shutting down the hospitals in Denver more than COVID ever did. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=14.0s)]
*  We shouldn't be allowing even one migrant into the country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=18.0s)]
*  Isn't this really an attempt, ultimately, to destroy the country internally? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=21.0s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=27.0s)]
*  It's poisonous stuff, and Fox News executives don't seem to care if what they're saying is true, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=29.0s)]
*  as quite famously demonstrated when they pout out a nine-figure settlement to Dominion voting machines. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=34.0s)]
*  And when they defended a now former primetime host from a slander lawsuit by just telling the court [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=40.0s)]
*  his Fox News show did not really do news so he couldn't be guilty of defamation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=45.0s)]
*  Which brings us to what happened the other night. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=50.0s)]
*  Fox News host Sean Hannity tried to get some synergy with another brand you might remember from the 80s. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=53.0s)]
*  The Guardian Angels and their vigilante founder Curtis Sleewa. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=58.0s)]
*  Do you remember him? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=62.0s)]
*  His gang was going to make the streets safe for regular people by rooting out criminals, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=63.0s)]
*  as he told the Today Show back in 1982. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=68.0s)]
*  Because the criminal is very violent and operates in what we call the wolf packs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=72.0s)]
*  You see them by the way they dress, their style, almost like modern-day pirates. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=77.0s)]
*  And that's what keeps you in fear. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=81.0s)]
*  Once they've smelled fear from you, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=83.0s)]
*  once they've seen you change your path of entry or to cross the street from where they're hanging out, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=85.0s)]
*  they descend upon you like wolves. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=90.0s)]
*  Oh my God, like a time warp to my childhood in the Bronx. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=93.0s)]
*  Fast forward to Tuesday night when Hannity interviewed Curtis Sleewa live in Times Square [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=96.0s)]
*  about 40 years older back in his costume like the Kiss reunion tour, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=102.0s)]
*  talking about the hellscape that is New York under the migrant invasion. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=107.0s)]
*  They had a remarkable Fox TV moment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=111.0s)]
*  If you divide $53 million by $500, that's a $106,000 debit card. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=115.0s)]
*  Not a bad deal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=122.0s)]
*  I don't think they're giving them to vets that are homeless in New York City. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=124.0s)]
*  Not that I've heard, Curtis. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=128.0s)]
*  In fact, our guys have just taken down one of the migrant guys right here on the corner, 42nd and 7th. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=131.0s)]
*  Can you pan the camera? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=138.0s)]
*  They've taken over. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=140.0s)]
*  They've taken over. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=142.0s)]
*  Light the camera over there if at all possible. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=143.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=149.0s)]
*  You got your key open, guys. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=152.0s)]
*  He is out of control. Out of control. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=158.0s)]
*  They had been shoplifting first. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=161.0s)]
*  The guardian angels spotted them, stopped them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=163.0s)]
*  He resisted. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=166.0s)]
*  And let's just say we gave him a little pain compliance. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=167.0s)]
*  His mother back in Venezuela felt the vibrations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=170.0s)]
*  He's sucking concrete. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=173.0s)]
*  What a despicable, despicable exhibition. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=177.0s)]
*  So, Sliwa says the man they were assaulting was a migrant shoplifter, the one that was sucking concrete. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=183.0s)]
*  A perfect story that Donald Trump and Fox News are telling their audience about the illegals and the rampant crime, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=190.0s)]
*  except, guess what? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=195.0s)]
*  After the cameras turned off, a little more reporting and digging revealed that the man Sliwa's gang wrestled down was not a migrant, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=196.0s)]
*  but, drum roll, a New Yorker from the Bronx. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=203.0s)]
*  And while Sliwa claimed he was a shoplifter, there was no evidence of that, and he was not charged with shoplifting by the police. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=207.0s)]
*  He was issued a disorderly conduct summons, apparently for being disruptive during Curtis's live shot. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=213.0s)]
*  In other words, a New Yorker in the middle of Times Square was interrupting a live shot of Curtis Sliwa, and his goons assaulted him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=221.0s)]
*  Yesterday, Fox once again had to do some cleanup to avoid another lawsuit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=228.0s)]
*  Now, Curtis said that the man was a migrant and that he was shoplifting. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=233.0s)]
*  Fox News has since spoken to the NYPD. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=238.0s)]
*  Apparently, the statements made by Curtis that the man is a migrant is not true. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=241.0s)]
*  Curtis said, in part, quote, I shouldn't have been listening to the crowd. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=246.0s)]
*  That was my mistake. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=250.0s)]
*  I should not have had that knee-jerk reaction. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=252.0s)]
*  Again, on the show, we always want to set the record straight. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=255.0s)]
*  Oh, they sure do. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=260.0s)]
*  Some good advice there, life advice generally for folks. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=261.0s)]
*  I shouldn't have been listening to the crowd and shouldn't have had the knee-jerk reaction. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=264.0s)]
*  You know, in America, there is a real issue we have right now with migration flows at the southern border, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=269.0s)]
*  both in terms of what danger and uncertainty it presents to the people that are showing up there [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=274.0s)]
*  and also the sort of strain it puts on various social systems here in New York and Denver and Chicago [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=279.0s)]
*  and a whole bunch of other places. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=285.0s)]
*  It is a real thing, and there's lots of folks working very hard to deal with it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=286.0s)]
*  And then there is the disgusting garbage that is being pumped out by Fox [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=291.0s)]
*  and other parts of the Rupert Murdoch empire like the New York Post, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=295.0s)]
*  just the vilest, most dehumanizing, disgusting filth you can imagine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=298.0s)]
*  Do you remember the nationwide shoplifting panic that turned out to be completely belied by the statistics [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=304.0s)]
*  or the splashy stories of a migrant caravan apocalypse that never came? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=311.0s)]
*  Please, remember those every time you hear a viral story in a city that, by the way, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=315.0s)]
*  where crime has dropped significantly last year during the migrant surge. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=321.0s)]
*  When you hear one of those viral stories, I am urging everyone, in the words of Curtis Sliwa, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=325.0s)]
*  don't have a knee-jerk reaction. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=331.0s)]
*  Wait for a bit for the truth to emerge. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=334.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIgWExBLQc&t=355.0s)]
