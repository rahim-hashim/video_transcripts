# ‘3-minute man’: Legal expert says Trump testimony will ‘blow up in his face’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU)
*  Did you ever have a flicker when you're taking a shower, walking to work or waking up in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=0.0s)]
*  the morning when you said, Donald Trump, you've won every battle you've ever fought, why don't [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=4.32s)]
*  you run for governor, why don't you run for president? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=7.84s)]
*  Do you ever think about that? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=9.52s)]
*  People want me to all the time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=10.6s)]
*  What about you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=11.76s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=12.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=13.76s)]
*  Can you imagine how controversial that'd be? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=14.76s)]
*  You think about him with the women. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=15.76s)]
*  How about me with the women? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=17.16s)]
*  That was from 1998. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=20.28s)]
*  Trump was nothing if not grossly prescient. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=22.04s)]
*  Today after being warned to keep his voice down in court, Trump took the witness stand [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=24.52s)]
*  briefly, very briefly, in his sexual abuse defamation damages trial. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=28.76s)]
*  The ex-president has already been found liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=34.72s)]
*  Jean Carroll. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  She said that he raped her in a dressing room. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  He called her a liar. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=42.68s)]
*  A jury found that he was lying, in fact, and was defaming her. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=43.68s)]
*  He said on the stand that he considered the finding to be a, quote, false allegation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=48.2s)]
*  But again, it's not a false allegation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=52.2s)]
*  In fact, calling it a false allegation is the defamation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=54.28s)]
*  He's been found liable of in the first place. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=57.92s)]
*  And so that testimony was promptly stricken, and Trump was soon sent back to the defense [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  table. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=64.88s)]
*  Trump says he will be back in court tomorrow for closing arguments. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  In addition to showing up at his sexual abuse defamation trial, Trump has also been reminding [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=69.52s)]
*  voters just who he is, with increasingly nasty attacks on his only remaining rival in the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Republican primary, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=80.36s)]
*  I mean, a lot of these Wall Street guys, they know me, they like me, and I see that they're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=83.8s)]
*  endorsing like Nikki Haley, bird brain. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=88.96s)]
*  A woman that I know very well, a woman that is not capable of doing this job, I know her [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=92.32s)]
*  very well. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=98.88s)]
*  She's not tough enough. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  She's not smart enough and she wasn't respected enough. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=101.56s)]
*  She cannot do this job. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=105.4s)]
*  Trump handily won the first two contests of the Republican nomination. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=107.72s)]
*  As you can see in the exit polling in New Hampshire, that victory was due in large part [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=111.16s)]
*  to a specific sector of the electorate, the big wins. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=115.16s)]
*  Men broke for Trump 49% to 39% for Haley, a 20 point difference. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=119.02s)]
*  And single men? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=123.88s)]
*  Well, they overwhelmingly preferred Trump 68% to 30%, plus 38 among single men. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=125.04s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=131.72s)]
*  But women? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=133.16s)]
*  Well, only 51% preferred Trump, 47% wanted Haley. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=134.16s)]
*  Katie Fang served as a prosecutor in the state attorney's office in Florida's Miami-Dade [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=139.32s)]
*  County. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=143.0s)]
*  She's the host of the Katie Fang Show, which airs Saturdays at noon here on MSNBC. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=144.0s)]
*  She's been following the E. Jean Carroll trial closely and she joins me now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=147.12s)]
*  I continue to be astounded that the person who is likely to be the nominee continues [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=151.6s)]
*  to draw attention to an accusation that he raped a woman and then defamed her, an accusation [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=157.62s)]
*  that was essentially substantiated in the civil trial and he was back at doing exactly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  that today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because it's on brand one and two, because he's able to raise money off of it, and three, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  because he's a virus. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=180.24s)]
*  And the Trump virus infects his followers and it gives them kind of the cover to be [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  able to emulate him and to say and do things that are mimicking of Donald Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=189.24s)]
*  And so because of that, that is the reason why Trump feels comfortable to lean into what [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=194.88s)]
*  he has done, which is exposed him to a minimum of $5 million so far. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=201.28s)]
*  And we'll see another big verdict come out of this second defamation trial from E. Jean [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=205.84s)]
*  Carroll. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  But as the numbers show, Chris, as you see, it's starting to very much whittle away, I [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  believe, at the support that he may have seen previously with female voters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=218.8s)]
*  But look, the truly decent ones were never going to support Donald Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=222.6s)]
*  His misogyny, his disgust for women, the way that he treats them as evidence by the way [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=227.12s)]
*  that he's treated E. Jean Carroll and others, that was never really for the decent women. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=233.08s)]
*  And so because of that, when you now see that there is an accountability alarm that is ringing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=238.12s)]
*  loud and clear across the country and many different courtrooms, this particular case [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=244.08s)]
*  is the one that bizarrely so he's decided is the one that he's going to show up to court [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=249.56s)]
*  for. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=255.28s)]
*  It's the one that he wants to take the stand for, even though he was merely the three minute [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  man today. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=259.72s)]
*  But it's the one that he's leaning into, which makes absolutely no sense. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=260.72s)]
*  But yet if you stop and you think about it, it kind of does because it fits exactly the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=264.2s)]
*  mold that he broke when he was made. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=268.44s)]
*  Yeah, I want to read because I want to get your feedback on the legal strategy here because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't think there is one. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  I think this is pure ego and insolence. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think it's also just a sense that like no one can hold you accountable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=279.12s)]
*  So you have to listen to anyone because no one ever has before. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=281.36s)]
*  And you know, when they're a star, they let you do what you want. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=284.56s)]
*  Like in a literal sense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=287.44000000000005s)]
*  That's what he said in the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=288.68s)]
*  In this sense, he is acting it out in courtroom with the woman who says he raped her and a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=290.48s)]
*  civil jury substantiated. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=294.56s)]
*  So he takes a stand and basically the judge is like, you can't just let him go off like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=296.76s)]
*  there are rules. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=302.48s)]
*  And the judge says, I want to know everything he's going to say. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  And Miss Habba says, I do not have an answer to that other than he stands by his deposition, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=305.52s)]
*  his testimony, the plaintiff brought in. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  He's going to say he stands by his testimony there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=311.64s)]
*  He's going to say he did not make the statements to hurt Miss Carroll. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=313.56s)]
*  He's going to say the address spawn the accusations and deny them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  The statements speak from the cells. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=318.48s)]
*  They've already been put into evidence. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=319.68s)]
*  And that is 100 percent of what he would say on the witness stand. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  I have three questions, Your Honor. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=323.88s)]
*  I just ran through it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=325.4s)]
*  I can't tell you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Answer my question. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm not testifying for my client, Your Honor. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  You are making an offer of proof and your client is bound by it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  And so he then gets on and he begins to essentially defame her again and gets yanked off. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=333.88s)]
*  Like is there some legal chess being played here I'm not getting or is this what it looks [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=339.28s)]
*  like? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=345.08s)]
*  I think you're imputing a little bit too much strategy to some situation where it doesn't [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=346.76s)]
*  exist. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=350.88s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=351.88s)]
*  So Habba did exactly what her client wanted her to do, which was push boundaries, because [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=352.88s)]
*  that's a Donald Trump thing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=356.92s)]
*  You want to push the boundaries to see what you get away with. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=357.92s)]
*  But the problem is, is that Donald Trump has been confronted with two significant things [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=360.36s)]
*  in this particular trial. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=364.92s)]
*  One, E. Jean Carroll. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=367.04s)]
*  He finally has somebody who's holding him to task, holding him to account for what the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=368.04s)]
*  wrongs that he has done and that he's inflicted on someone. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  The fact that it took someone at her age and that it's a woman to do it is particularly [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=376.36s)]
*  significant. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  But two, he's also been confronted with Judge Lewis Kaplan. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  So Judge Kaplan in this case has had him and Alina Habba on the tightest of leashes [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=385.16s)]
*  and he's not tolerated anything. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  And he's basically said, I'm not going to give you leeway in any capacity. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=393.48s)]
*  So Alina Habba decided to try, but she couldn't get away with it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=397.18s)]
*  And I think it's going to blow up in his face because Donald Trump's having this jury that's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  watching this happen. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=405.26000000000005s)]
*  And none of it is positive for Donald Trump. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  Katie Fang, as always, a pleasure. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=409.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSL6golTfU&t=415.16s)]
