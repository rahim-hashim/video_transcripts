# Elon Musk ‘melts down’ after underestimating wrath of MAGA trolls
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We still have three weeks until Donald Trump is sworn into a second term [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=0.0s)]
*  There's no denying that with some [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  General genuine political candidness Trump has cobbled together an unwieldy and in many respects somewhat unlikely [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=8.18s)]
*  Political coalition and that coalition delivered him the first outright popular vote victory for Republicans since George W [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=14.4s)]
*  Bush in 2004. It's only the second time it has happened since the end of the Cold War [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=21.38s)]
*  Now Trump has to actually govern and that is typically when all the internal contradictions in any political coalition rise to the surface [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=26.26s)]
*  We're not even to inauguration yet and that factional fighting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=33.54s)]
*  I would argue is bigger more glaring than almost any other I've ever witnessed in American politics [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  You're seeing that right now in the battle over immigration which has been exploding among the MAGA, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Basically, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy the tech overlords who appear to be running Trump's second term agenda [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  Rely on highly skilled immigrants to power their enterprises [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=55.1s)]
*  Those immigrants come to this country to work with an h1b visa [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=58.9s)]
*  Which provides terms that are extremely favorable to their employers and also an amazing opportunity for the folks coming to work here [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  Folks basically have to stay at their job in order to stay in the country if they leave their position [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=69.02s)]
*  They have two months to find a new job or risk getting deported [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=73.46s)]
*  So you can see why someone like Elon Musk likes them so much [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=77.02s)]
*  For example, this is not abstract when Musk bought Twitter and a huge percentage of the staff headed for the exits [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=81.04s)]
*  Vice News reported on how Twitter employees on visas [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=87.72s)]
*  Can't just quit [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  The other side of the debate over the h1b visa is the one that folks like Stephen Miller and Stephen Bannon have been pushing for years [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=92.68s)]
*  that we should restrict limit perhaps and all immigration the US legal and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=100.76s)]
*  Illegal right stuff at the border around asylum, but also h1b visas [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=106.72s)]
*  I mean just listen to the two of them on Bannon's old radio show back in March of 2016 [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=111.08s)]
*  This before Trump was even the Republican nominee take a listen [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=116.32s)]
*  And they see these oligarchs down there with 54 private jets and they're not down there for their health [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  They're called together by Karl Rove and it's a stop Trump movement [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=125.56s)]
*  It's a stop Trump movement because they want unlimited HB 1 visas isn't the beating heart of this problem right now the real beating heart [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=128.92s)]
*  Of what we got to get sorted here is not illegal immigration as horrific as that is and it's horrific [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=135.4s)]
*  It don't we have a problem. We've looked the other way on this legal immigration [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=140.96s)]
*  That's kind of overwhelmed the country the history of America is that an immigration on period is followed by an immigration off period [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=144.54s)]
*  To see be very clear there right h1b visas legal immigration and immigration off period like they have a pretty clear vision [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Miller's gonna be the one writing that border bill [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=159.84s)]
*  So those two factions the Republican Party with pretty profoundly different views are at each other's throats about what to do with their newfound power [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=162.76s)]
*  Should they use the legal immigration system to continue supplying Silicon Valley and other industries with highly skilled workers? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=171.56s)]
*  Or should they apply some new? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=177.96s)]
*  Racist immigrant exclusion act like the Chinese Exclusion Act to deport all those workers and let their American let Americans take their jobs [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=180.36s)]
*  Defense of the former argument that is continuing h1b visas Elon Musk spent his Christmas week [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=187.52s)]
*  Absolutely melting down the social media platform. He owns [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=193.44s)]
*  He has since deleted many of those posts including one that replied approvingly to a post calling [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=196.44s)]
*  American burn workers in general a slur [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=202.4s)]
*  The R word for being too stupid to be able to do the jobs that workers on h1b visas were doing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=205.52s)]
*  One emblematic post is still up where must tells opponents of h1b visas to f themselves [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=212.44s)]
*  Before pledging to go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=217.52s)]
*  Although he seems to underestimate how much the Maga diehards hate immigration [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=222.6s)]
*  His online base of right-wing Twitter trolls quickly turned on him spurned on by the likes of Bannon as well as Laura Loomer the fringe [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=227.0s)]
*  For our right activists who spent much of the fall cozying up to Trump before his campaign stepped in and pushed her aside [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=233.62s)]
*  It's not a civil war because they're not tough enough. They're just not I don't think that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=239.16s)]
*  It's acceptable for George Soros Elon Musk or Peter teal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=243.72s)]
*  It doesn't matter what side of the political aisle a billionaire is on [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=248.2s)]
*  I don't think that it's acceptable for billionaires to have this much power and this much access [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=252.04s)]
*  on the policy dispute here, and there is a real one [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=257.4s)]
*  Trump actually took must side on it coming out in support of h1b visas in comments the New York Post quote [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=261.32s)]
*  I have many h1b visas on my properties. I've been a believer in h1b. I've used it many times. It's a great program now [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=267.4s)]
*  I have to say I think Trump might be confused here. I [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=272.67999999999995s)]
*  Don't think his properties are hiring a ton of say like software engineers off h1b as the New York Times reports [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=276.76s)]
*  Trump has been a frequent and longtime user of the similarly named but starkly different [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=282.2s)]
*  H2B visa program which is for unskilled workers like gardeners and housekeepers [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=286.76s)]
*  Of course, you can drive yourself crazy and aren't trying to track Trump's plans [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=293.0s)]
*  Anything at any given moment in 2016. Of course he called for guess what the h1b to be banned [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=295.88s)]
*  Nobody knows the system better than me. I know the h1b. I know the h2b [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=303.32s)]
*  Nobody knows it better than me [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=308.04s)]
*  I know the h1b very well and it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=309.64s)]
*  We shouldn't have it very very bad for workers [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=315.08s)]
*  Regardless, it was nice of Trump to back his co-president Elon Musk this time [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=318.68s)]
*  Not that it helped much as Musk seems to have backed down. He now calls our legal immigration system broken [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=322.12s)]
*  And in one sense [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=325.8s)]
*  You know, there's a bunch of weirdos online fighting with each other [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=327.8s)]
*  You know, it's a day ending a why [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=331.32s)]
*  But these people I mean the guy who's about to be president the world's richest man. They're about to be in power [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=333.32s)]
*  They're gonna be making decisions if this fight was any indication [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=339.32s)]
*  This fractured coalition is not going to make governing [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=342.36s)]
*  That easy for them when they get in power [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  McKay Coppins is a staff writer for the Atlantic and author of Romney a reckoning charlie dents is a former republican congressman of Pennsylvania [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  And they joined me now McKay [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  I thought of you because about a month ago you and I had a conversation on my podcast why is this happening? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  The main theme of which was [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, this coalition was successful politically. Yes, they were successful [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  But they were not successful [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=363.16s)]
*  They were not successful [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=365.16s)]
*  They were not successful [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=367.16s)]
*  They were not successful [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=369.16s)]
*  The main theme of which was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=371.16s)]
*  Yes, this coalition was successful politically [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=373.16s)]
*  Yes, they they won and they will control the house and the senate and the presidency [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=375.16s)]
*  But there are deep internal real genuine [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=379.16s)]
*  Factions and fights and tensions ideologically and and it was interesting that immigration was the first one [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=383.16s)]
*  We've sort of seen kind of blow up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=389.16s)]
*  It's especially interesting because immigration has been kind of like the defining issue of the trump era in a lot of ways, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=393.16s)]
*  In a lot of ways what's happening now is only the latest flare-up in a pretty old fight in the republican coalition [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=399.16s)]
*  You can take any presidential election of the 21st century and find this divide between [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=405.16s)]
*  Chamber of commerce republicans and the wall street editorial board on one one side wall street journal editorial board [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=411.16s)]
*  And on the other side kind of conservative talk radio fox news and the right wing base on the other [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=417.16s)]
*  And every republican presidential candidate in the last 25 years has tried to straddle this line [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=423.16s)]
*  You remember mitt romney in 2012. He talked about self deportation [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=429.16s)]
*  That was kind of his red meat to the base [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=433.16s)]
*  He also talked about stapling a green card on every college diploma of an immigrant who came to the u.s. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=435.16s)]
*  Right. And so what's interesting is that trump, you know made immigration [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=441.16s)]
*  One of his key wedges in 2016 in the republican primaries [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=447.16s)]
*  He was seen as this extremely populist figure. Um, but I don't think we should be that surprised [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=451.16s)]
*  That he has now found himself siding with what is essentially the chamber of commerce position on immigration [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=457.16s)]
*  Big shocker. Yeah. Well, here's the thing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=463.16s)]
*  I talked to a republican elected official just a couple weeks ago who said, you know [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=467.16s)]
*  And the thing about trump that people always fail to understand is that the most consistent metric [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=471.16s)]
*  He uses to judge people is their their their network, right? It's how much money they have [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=477.16s)]
*  And so we should not be shocked that elon musk has been allowed in the hen house [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=483.16s)]
*  It's not because he is, you know, searing political charisma. It's because he's incredibly wealthy [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=487.16s)]
*  There is a reason that trump often defers to his golf buddies and high dollar donors and allies in silicon valley and wall street [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=492.16s)]
*  He cares what those people think of him [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=499.16s)]
*  So I think that that helps that should help inform how this kind of battle is going to play out [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=502.16s)]
*  And it's also why why bannon is is sort of so, you know angry about this and somewhat performative [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=508.16s)]
*  But and charlie look you I mean, I've I've covered this issue for 20 years [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=514.1600000000001s)]
*  You're a veteran of these exact fights where there really is this tension that mckay highlighted [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  What I think is interesting to me this new factor, which is musk [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=523.1600000000001s)]
*  Brings this totally different set of ideological like commitments and also material commitments into this universe that weren't there even six months ago [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=527.16s)]
*  Like now it's like everything has to be about well, there's the trump position [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=537.16s)]
*  There's the base and then there's what is elon musk think and I've never seen anything like it where there's just this new [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=541.16s)]
*  It's like a new planet came in and now everything has to orbit around that as well [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=547.16s)]
*  You [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hw9jSpkNI&t=557.16s)]
