# Lara Trump vows ‘every single penny’ of RNC funds will go to Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160)
*  All right, so Donald Trump was in court again today as part of his New York criminal case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=0.0s)]
*  And because it is nearly impossible, frankly, to keep track, this is the case about the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=5.4s)]
*  criminal election interference conspiracy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=9.84s)]
*  Trump participated in to get himself elected the first time back in 2016. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  That's the one where he had an extramarital affair with an adult film actress Stormy Daniels, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=17.04s)]
*  while his third wife was at home with their newborn child. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=21.56s)]
*  And then he bribed Daniels with $130,000 to stay quiet about it right before the election, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=24.68s)]
*  when he was reeling from the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=30.0s)]
*  Trump is now facing 34 criminal counts as a result in New York court. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=33.88s)]
*  His trial will begin in little over a month on March 25th. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And you know, as we know, that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his legal [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=43.52s)]
*  laws. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's an overstatement to say there's not a single person on the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  planet right now, possibly, who is under more legal pressure than this man. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=51.96s)]
*  One of the things we are seeing develop is that his approach to all of this is endless [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=57.12s)]
*  delay delay delay. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=61.04s)]
*  And that can actually be a pretty effective and serious legal strategy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=63.08s)]
*  There is a reason that most criminal defendants and litigants do not pursue it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=66.32s)]
*  All of this law lawyering costs a shocking amount of money. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=71.88s)]
*  Think about this, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=76.36s)]
*  Right now, Trump is paying for lawyers in the New York criminal Stormy Daniels trial [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=77.36s)]
*  and the New York state civil fraud trial, which is threatening the Trump organization [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=82.92s)]
*  with the corporate death penalty, as well as his second New York civil fraud trial, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=87.56s)]
*  in which he was found liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=92.8s)]
*  It's not a civil fraud trial, civil trial liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=96.2s)]
*  for the second time after a previous civil trial, where he was also found liable for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=100.12s)]
*  sexually abusing her. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=104.68s)]
*  The ex president now needs to pay her $83 million, a verdict that he has pledged to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=107.4s)]
*  appeal, but he's unlikely to prevail. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=111.4s)]
*  That's just one bucket. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  OK, the ex president is also paying for lawyers in special counsel Jack Smith's federal 2020 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  election interference case and not just for the case, you know, the trial case, but his [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=120.68s)]
*  subsequent appeal all the way to the Supreme Court to get it thrown out on bogus immunity [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  grounds. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Not only that, he's got lawyers defending him in the Colorado case. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=130.84s)]
*  Remember, that's the one that's trying to get him disqualified from the ballot under [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=134.36s)]
*  Section three of the 14th Amendment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=137.56s)]
*  He's also appealing that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=139.6s)]
*  He's just arguing in front of the Supreme Court. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=140.6s)]
*  That's expensive lawyer. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=143.04s)]
*  Then there is Jack Smith's other federal criminal case stemming from, remember this, Trump's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=145.88s)]
*  basically outright theft of classified documents and the other election interference case, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=150.88s)]
*  the racketeering charges in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  And to be clear, there's likely some overlap in these cases, but we don't know exactly [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=160.32s)]
*  how many attorneys currently represent the ex president. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=164.12s)]
*  We know there are a lot of them and that there are lots and lots of billable hours [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=167.6s)]
*  costing lots and lots and lots of money. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=173.04s)]
*  In fact, last year alone, Trump spent over $52 million just on legal fees, according [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=175.32s)]
*  to one analysis. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=182.2s)]
*  Now, we know that, we kind of know it, because Trump is not actually footing the bill himself. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=183.2s)]
*  He has been raising huge amounts of money through his fundraising apparatus, crowdsourcing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=188.7s)]
*  slush fund from basically the devoted MAGA grandparents of America. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=194.2s)]
*  But at a certain point, that well is going to run dry and at just the worst time too, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=199.16s)]
*  because if you think Trump has expensive fees now, just wait until these criminal cases [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  actually go to trial. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  Think about the billable hours there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  Luckily for Trump, he has found the perfect entity to take over and use for legal fundraising. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=212.56s)]
*  And that is one of America's two major parties, the Republican National Committee. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=218.14s)]
*  You may have seen the recent news that despite her embarrassing and ethically degrading fealty [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=222.68s)]
*  to Donald Trump, Ronna Romney McDaniel is set to be effectively kicked out of her position [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=227.08s)]
*  as head of the RNC. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=231.56s)]
*  It looks like she is going to be replaced by some diehard Trump loyalists, including [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=233.3s)]
*  his longtime supporter, Michael Watley, currently the head of the North Carolina Republican [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=237.28s)]
*  Party, Chris LaCivita, a longtime Republican operative whose current second in command [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=241.32s)]
*  on Trump's campaign, and Trump's own daughter-in-law and former Fox News pundit, Lara Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=246.4s)]
*  And they are not hiding in any way what the takeover means. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=252.64s)]
*  If I am elected to this position, I can assure you there will not be any more $70,000 or [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=255.88s)]
*  whatever exorbitant amount of money it was spent on flowers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=263.24s)]
*  Every single penny will go to the number one and the only job of the RNC. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=266.6s)]
*  That is electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=271.24s)]
*  The only job of the RNC that is electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=275.68s)]
*  There you have it, straight from the woman named Trump who is about to co-chair the committee. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=282.52s)]
*  The RNC is about to become Republican in name only, funding all that donated money to pay [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=285.88s)]
*  for Trump trials around the country instead of elections. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=290.52s)]
*  And they all know it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=293.5s)]
*  As Politico reports, quote, I love this line, several senior Republican officials are concerned [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's expected takeover of the RNC will ultimately pave the way for the committee [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=299.64s)]
*  to once again cover his legal bills. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=304.02s)]
*  Joining me now is someone who knows a thing or two about this, former RNC chair Michael [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=307.32s)]
*  Steele, host of the new show The Weeknd, alongside my friend, Alicia Menendez and Simone Sanders. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  It's Saturday and Sunday morning right here on MSNBC and it's excellent viewing. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  Good to have you here, Michael. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, my friends. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=320.91999999999996s)]
*  You guys are doing great work. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm loving it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  So, my understanding is they've already paid a bunch of his legal bills in the past, but [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  they kind of made a distinction between what they would and wouldn't pay, basically. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=331.88s)]
*  And basically, we're like, we're not going to pay for your personal legal bills. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=337.56s)]
*  We'll pay for stuff that you were doing back when you were there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=340.6s)]
*  But it seems like if he controls the committee, he can just get them to pay for anything? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=344.68s)]
*  Well, look, first off, I went broke just listening to your describing all of his legal problems. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=349.48s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=355.0s)]
*  That's a lot, number one. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=356.0s)]
*  Number two, past is prologue. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=357.0s)]
*  And you already saw how they handled, as these cases and other issues were emerging during [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=361.36s)]
*  his four years, how the RNC was used financially, where resources were going, and how it impacted, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=367.12s)]
*  quite honestly, which is why they weren't winning elections in some critical states, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=374.76s)]
*  because they didn't have the resources to put on the ground, because those resources [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=379.68s)]
*  were largely diverted. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=383.44s)]
*  So, here we are now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  So, here's the play. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  If I want to take something over, what do I do? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=387.44s)]
*  I clear out the leadership. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=390.04s)]
*  So I take out the national chairwoman, and I put in a sycophant, a loyalist, who primarily [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=392.12s)]
*  and fundamentally agrees that the last election was stolen. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=399.68s)]
*  Put a pin in it, and it's important, because if it gets re-elected, what that means is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=404.24s)]
*  you now have in place some of the groundwork you're going to need to make the claims to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=409.24s)]
*  re-litigate the 2020 election. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=413.79999999999995s)]
*  But we can talk about that another time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=416.2s)]
*  The second thing is you then put people who you are close with, family members, and close [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=417.72s)]
*  allies and associates, like La Servieta, and put them in charge of the day-to-day operations. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=423.56s)]
*  That's where the money comes in. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  That's where the ground game really comes in, is materialized for him. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=432.8s)]
*  The dollars come in. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  They go out the door in other forms and fashions to pay for those bills as they come due, and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=438.44000000000005s)]
*  that, as Politico and other sources are noting, is a real problem going forward. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=443.6s)]
*  The comparison I was making, there's a great Sopranos episode called The Bust Out. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK6S8uD5160&t=449.6s)]
