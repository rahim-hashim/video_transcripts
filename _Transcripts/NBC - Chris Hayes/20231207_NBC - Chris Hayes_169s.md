# Hunter Biden faces new criminal tax charges
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA)
*  the president's son, Hunter Biden, who's already been charged, who had charges [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=0.0s)]
*  brought against him by a prosecutor in Delaware. It looked like they were going to come to a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=6.16s)]
*  plea agreement. The judge in that rejected that plea months ago. We went back to square one that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=10.32s)]
*  that U.S. attorney was elevated to be a special prosecutor who's now brought some felony charges [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=16.32s)]
*  against him for a felony possession of a gun. We've got new news tonight that there are additional [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=21.6s)]
*  tax charges, three federal felony tax charges against Hunter Biden. These are coming out of a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=27.6s)]
*  California district. I think that's probably where he was living at the time. Failure to file and pay [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=33.44s)]
*  taxes, evasion of assessment, false or fraudulent tax return, failure to file and pay taxes. Your [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=37.68s)]
*  thoughts on that? I think this has been somewhat of a debacle for the Justice Department and the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=42.72s)]
*  special prosecution. It really looks like they're punishing him for their messy plea bargaining [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  ability and a failure to resolve it. With this kind of a tax charge, and we're not talking about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=56.64s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars in evasion, the fact that he had already paid it back, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=62.88s)]
*  that usually will absolve the person of the criminal charges here. But these charges were [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=68.0s)]
*  not unexpected. The plea fell apart. So theoretically, everything that you were trying to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=73.52s)]
*  resolve with the plea comes back. Just for context, Lisa, I mean, people that don't know [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=77.44s)]
*  tax law would be astounded by the insane abrogation you can have of paying your taxes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=82.72s)]
*  that are not dealt with criminally and are basically worked out in the civil system or [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=90.4s)]
*  through negotiations. I mean, huge amounts of money. You got to really go out of your way. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=95.44s)]
*  Very high bar for criminal prosecution of tax charges. That's right. And what I remember from [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=100.4s)]
*  the earlier proceedings, Chris, is our colleague at NBC News, Tom Winter, saying, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=106.56s)]
*  to the extent that the Hunter Biden case reflects a two-tiered system of justice, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=110.64s)]
*  it's not a disfavored Hunter Biden. Even at the stage where we were expecting both a plea agreement [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  and a diversion on the gun charges, there were people who thought even that was too harsh. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=120.24s)]
*  So now that he's subject to not one, but two indictments, one in the District of Delaware, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=124.72s)]
*  and now this new tax indictment in California, I think that really thoroughly deflates the Trumpian [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=129.68s)]
*  argument that there are two systems of justice and Donald Trump is the one disfavored by it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=135.84s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, who is not here at this table because of the first night of Hanukkah, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=140.32s)]
*  thank you so much for making some time and happy Hanukkah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=143.2s)]
*  Shan Wu, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juYjNqT4tbA&t=145.6s)]
