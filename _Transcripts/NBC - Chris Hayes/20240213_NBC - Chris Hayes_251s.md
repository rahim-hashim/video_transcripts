# Putin is cashing in on his ‘enormous’ investment in Trump, says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo)
*  Donald Trump is very likely the Republican nominee for president, but he's more than just a candidate for office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was actually the president before. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=5.0s)]
*  People seem to have weirdly blocked it out, maybe because the whole thing was so traumatizing, but I assure you, he was there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=8.0s)]
*  He has an actual record. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=14.0s)]
*  In that record, he did everything in office as president to undermine NATO, falsely painting it as a kind of protection racket in which the members were not paying him enough tribute. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=16.0s)]
*  Trump even tried to get the U.S. to leave the alliance it founded altogether, according to multiple counts from people inside his administration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=25.0s)]
*  He also did everything he could to encourage Russian aggression against NATO. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=33.0s)]
*  He famously sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies in public about Russian sabotage of the 2016 election. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=37.0s)]
*  In that context, what he said this weekend was fully in line with his thinking, though unhinged even by his standards. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=46.0s)]
*  One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=54.0s)]
*  Well, sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=57.0s)]
*  I said, You didn't pay? You're delinquent? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=62.0s)]
*  He said, Yes, let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=66.0s)]
*  Now, first of all, that almost certainly didn't happen whenever he gives you like a yes, sir story. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=76.0s)]
*  But that aside, I was a little surprised to see several major news outlets fail to cite an obviously relevant piece of context, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=81.0s)]
*  which is that Vladimir Putin is desperate to reach a negotiated settlement to steal a big chunk of Ukraine and is counting on the Republican Party in the U.S. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=88.0s)]
*  to essentially aid him by cutting off aid to the beleaguered army of Ukraine, which is quite literally running out of ammunition. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=96.0s)]
*  You know who did point out that context? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=103.0s)]
*  President Biden in brief remarks today that called for funding Ukraine and blasted Trump's comments. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=105.0s)]
*  Can you imagine a former president of the United States saying that the whole world heard it? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=112.0s)]
*  The worst thing is he means it. No other president in our history has ever bowed down to a Russian dictator. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=119.0s)]
*  Let me say this as clearly as I can. I never will. For God's sake, it's dumb and shameful. It's dangerous. It's un-American. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=126.0s)]
*  And of course, Putin made an enormous investment in Trump personally, one that has been paying enormous dividends. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=135.0s)]
*  He personally authorized a Russian operation to support a, quote, mentally unstable Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, as The Guardian put it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=141.0s)]
*  And now Trump effectively runs the Republican Party and is, for all the world, acting like a man who wants to continue pleasing his patron, Putin. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=150.0s)]
*  He is going to do what he can to not only destroy the NATO alliance, but to make Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression impossible. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=158.0s)]
*  And Trump's comments are reverberating around the world, sending Europeans into equal parts rage and panic. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=165.0s)]
*  Here at home, the Republican Party base is under Donald Trump's thumb. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=171.0s)]
*  The Senate just overwhelmingly passed a bill to send military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=175.0s)]
*  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson says his Trumpy majority is probably not even going to take the bill up for a vote in Congress. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=181.0s)]
*  Just think about the incentives Putin had in 2016, the lengths that he went to to help get Trump elected, criminal sabotage of an American election. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=189.0s)]
*  We've talked at length about how desperate Trump is to get back in the White House in hopes of eluding jail time and not, you know, possibly dying in prison. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=197.0s)]
*  Think about the stakes for Putin now, as his war drags on and he desperately wants to end it with a Russian victory. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=205.0s)]
*  And he has this one figure in his pocket singing his tune to half of America's two-party system, which is to say Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin need each other. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=211.0s)]
*  With a coincidence of interests they hope will be stronger than NATO, stronger even than American democracy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbYSp0ROmo&t=221.0s)]
