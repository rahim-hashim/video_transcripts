# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 18
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are awaiting a ruling from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Donald Trump's audacious and dangerous claim of New York total presidential immunity for crimes he committed while in office while president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=0.0s)]
*  In court last week, as you probably remember, Trump's lawyer argued the president should have the power to effectively do whatever he wants, including, for instance, having a political rival assassinated by SEAL Team 6 or selling pardons [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=14.0s)]
*  and could face no criminal accountability or prosecution unless he was first successfully impeached and convicted. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=27.0s)]
*  Could a president order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? That's an official act in order to seal Team 6? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=36.0s)]
*  He would have to be and would speedily be, you know, impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=44.0s)]
*  But if you weren't, there would be no criminal prosecution, no criminal liability for that? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=50.0s)]
*  Chief Justice's opinion of Marlborough against Madison and our Constitutional tradition and the plain language of the impeachment judgment clause all clearly presuppose that what the founders were concerned about was not... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=55.0s)]
*  I asked you a yes or no question. Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=68.0s)]
*  If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=80.0s)]
*  So your answer is no. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=83.0s)]
*  Is my answer is qualified yes? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=85.0s)]
*  It was always clear that these weren't particularly sound legal arguments. You could almost hear the resignation in Trump's lawyer's voice as he slowly, against his own will, allowed himself to be backed into the proverbial corner. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=88.0s)]
*  And that's because these arguments are not rooted, first and foremost, in an interpretation of the law and the Constitution. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=100.0s)]
*  Rather, they were reverse engineered to arrive at the conclusion Donald Trump is demanding. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=105.0s)]
*  In case there are any questions about that, the ex-president effectively admitted it himself on social media today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=110.0s)]
*  In all caps, he ranted, quote, a president of the United States must have full immunity. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=116.0s)]
*  Even events that cross the line must fall under total immunity. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=120.0s)]
*  Which sure sounds like a tacit admission of guilt, doesn't it? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=125.0s)]
*  In a bizarre analogy, he compared himself to a dirty cop, quote, you can't stop police from doing the job of strong and effective crime prevention because you want to guard against the occasional rogue copper bad apple. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=128.0s)]
*  Sometimes you just have to live with great but slightly imperfect. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=139.0s)]
*  Then for good measure, he ended with a not so subtle message to the 6-3 MAGA majority, quote, hopefully this will be an easy decision. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=145.0s)]
*  God bless the Supreme Court. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=152.0s)]
*  Not a lot of subtext there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=154.0s)]
*  Don't need some sort of like decoder ring. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=157.0s)]
*  He's saying what he believes, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=161.0s)]
*  This is an authentic expression of Trumpism. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=164.0s)]
*  As authentic an expression of Trumpism as we have ever seen from the ex-president himself. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=167.0s)]
*  It is what this entire campaign and the movement is centered around now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=172.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the singular animating focus, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=176.0s)]
*  Immunity, the concept he is above the law, the nation is under his control, that he will be a dictator on day one of his second term. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=179.0s)]
*  And for that vision to function, the ex-president needs to craft a legal context in which he cannot be held accountable by the very institutions that he wishes to control. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=186.0s)]
*  In Trump's view, even when the president, and let's just be clear, not just any president, him really, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=195.0s)]
*  Like he wouldn't feel this way about Joe Biden or Barack Obama, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=202.0s)]
*  When the president, Donald Trump, does things that are obviously illegal over the line in his own words, as he puts it, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=205.0s)]
*  he still must have full immunity as long as he enough cronies on his side to prevent impeachment and conviction in Congress, which Trump knows he has, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=213.0s)]
*  I also think it's particularly notable that Trump compared himself to rogue cops and bad apples, which is to say police officers who break the law. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=222.0s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=230.0s)]
*  Police officers are rarely held legally accountable for official misconduct. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=231.0s)]
*  The dubious legal doctrine of qualified immunity means that officers can almost never be sued for violating your rights. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=235.0s)]
*  Fatal shootings by police are rarely prosecuted, even if they are unjustified. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=243.0s)]
*  But also, there is not blanket criminal immunity for cops. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=248.0s)]
*  Criminal prosecutions for accountability for police misconduct do happen sometimes, like in perhaps the most famous instance of a police killing in my lifetime. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=253.0s)]
*  Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison today for the murder of George Floyd. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=263.0s)]
*  Thomas Lane, one of the other former Minneapolis police officers charged in connection with George Floyd's death nearly two years ago, has agreed to plead guilty. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=271.0s)]
*  Jay Alexander King took a plea deal back in October to avoid a state criminal trial. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=280.0s)]
*  The ex-Minneapolis officer is already serving a federal sentence related to the death. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=285.0s)]
*  The sentence of 57 months in prison for Chauvin, one of the officers involved in George Floyd's death, is significantly higher than even what prosecutors were asking for. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=290.0s)]
*  Remember, those four officers were acting in their official capacity. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=301.0s)]
*  No question when George Floyd was murdered, they were wearing uniforms, they were responding to a call. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=304.0s)]
*  They were still prosecuted and then convicted. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=309.0s)]
*  Trump's theory, such as it is, is that he deserves even less scrutiny than the already threadbare standard we've set for police in this country. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=314.0s)]
*  Now, a lot of these legal arguments surround, of course, they're about this trial that we're expecting this year. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=325.0s)]
*  Particularly the trial for January 6th, the events leading up to it, the attempt to subvert the Constitutional Republic, and the subtext for this entire back and forth unfolding before the courts is, will Donald Trump be able to shrug off criminal charges for attempting a coup? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=330.0s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=342.0s)]
*  But it also goes beyond that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=344.0s)]
*  I think it's sort of important to internalize this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=346.0s)]
*  Avoiding prison may be Trump's most pressing concern, but it is not the only reason he wants total unaccountability as president. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=350.0s)]
*  He is running for president again, after all. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=358.0s)]
*  As of now, he appears to be cruising to the Republican nomination. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=361.0s)]
*  If and when he is nominated, he's got a real shot at retaking the White House. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=364.0s)]
*  So imagine what he will do if the courts affirm that he cannot ever face justice without an impeachment in the House and a conviction in the Senate first. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=369.0s)]
*  If his lawyers will admit out loud in front of a judge that Trump cannot face charges for ordering the military to assassinate his opponents, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=380.0s)]
*  just imagine what Trump is speculating about in private. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=387.0s)]
*  The judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals should be, and I imagine are, thinking long and hard about what affirming Trump's argument would mean for the fate of this country. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=392.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of really good reporting on the possible agenda of a second Trump administration, and largely it's terrifying. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=403.0s)]
*  It's a vision of retribution-based government or presidential dictatorship that crushes dissent, triggers mass deportations, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=410.0s)]
*  or for all those radical plans to essentially subvert American democracy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=416.0s)]
*  There's a central aspect of Trumpism that's very old-school Republicanism, and that is helping out the richest Americans and the biggest corporations. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=421.0s)]
*  Now, you don't hear it from Trump at the campaign trail, and he heaps on the populist authoritarian red meat to adoring crowds of, quote, everyday people. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=429.0s)]
*  But as Jeff Stein of the Washington Post reported this month, behind closed doors, Trump is telling people close to them he would like to push through a big second round of the Trump administration. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=437.0s)]
*  A round of tax cuts for the biggest corporations. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=446.0s)]
*  If you were paying attention, this has been a dynamic of Trumpism all the way back to 2016. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=449.0s)]
*  All of Trump's America First populism had him railing against the establishment donor class and taking back the country for the little guy, and doing it with really dark overtones. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=454.0s)]
*  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=465.0s)]
*  For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interest, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=470.0s)]
*  So that's what he said to voters, and then a week after he won that election, he went to the 21 Club restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=481.0s)]
*  a former speakeasy frequented by the rich and the powerful, and he told the plutocrats there something completely different. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=488.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=495.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=496.0s)]
*  Happy Sir President Election. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=497.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=498.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=499.0s)]
*  We'll get your taxes down. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=500.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=501.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=502.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=503.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=504.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=505.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=506.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=507.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=508.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=509.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=510.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=511.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=512.0s)]
*  Yeah, they love them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=513.0s)]
*  We'll get your taxes down, don't worry. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=514.0s)]
*  That was one of the rare promises that Donald Trump absolutely kept. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=515.0s)]
*  In 2017, he signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill, largely for the rich and corporations. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=517.0s)]
*  It was hands down the largest, the least popular piece of legislation he ever signed and his most important, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=523.0s)]
*  a plan that gave lots of breaks to the rich, to corporations, and didn't stimulate the economy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=530.0s)]
*  It also, and people forget this, it gave Trump his lowest approval rating until the Capitol insurrection. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=534.0s)]
*  Trump is now thinking about doing it again, because fundamentally that is whose interest Donald Trump is looking to serve, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=541.0s)]
*  even as he accuses his challengers of being captured by rich special interests. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=547.0s)]
*  Nikki Haley has been in the pocket of the open borders establishment owners her entire career, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=553.0s)]
*  and she's a globalist, you know, she likes the globe. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=558.0s)]
*  I like America first. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=562.0s)]
*  She likes the globe. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=564.0s)]
*  What makes that rhetoric especially rich is that at this very moment, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=566.0s)]
*  the globalists, the global financial elites are gathering together in the stately Alpine ski resort town of Davos, Switzerland, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=570.0s)]
*  for the annual World Economic Forum convention. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=576.0s)]
*  So is the donor class fearful of what another Trump term portends for them? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=579.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=583.0s)]
*  Not according to multiple US executives in Davos who spoke with CNBC this week. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=584.0s)]
*  One prominent US business executive who asked not to be named said a Trump victory won't be the end of the world. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=589.0s)]
*  Another US bank CEO privately told CNBC that Trump is, quote, all bark and no bite. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=594.0s)]
*  The bank chief then added, quote, he's going to win the presidency. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=599.0s)]
*  Many of his policies were right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=602.0s)]
*  The point that Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, had no trouble making on the record. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=604.0s)]
*  He was kind of right about NATO, kind of right about immigration. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=609.0s)]
*  He grew the economy quite well. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=613.0s)]
*  China virus. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=615.0s)]
*  Tax reform worked. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=616.0s)]
*  He was right about some of China. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=617.0s)]
*  As a CEO of a multinational global business, what you think would be better for the business? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=619.0s)]
*  I have to be prepared for both. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=625.0s)]
*  I will be prepared for both. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=627.0s)]
*  We will deal with both. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=629.0s)]
*  My company will survive and thrive in both. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=631.0s)]
*  I love Jamie Dian saying tax reform work. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=634.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=637.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, JP Morgan got an enormous tax cut like every other corporation it worked. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=638.0s)]
*  The global financial elites of Davos will be just fine because the Trump tax cuts were great for them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=644.0s)]
*  As everyday Americans consider how our reinvigorated, revenge-seeking President Trump will stick it to the left [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=650.0s)]
*  and to immigrants, to gay and trans folks, to women seeking bodily autonomy, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=656.0s)]
*  it is absolutely clear to me that while a second Trump term threatens American democracy [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=660.0s)]
*  and threatens a lot of Americans, it sure does not threaten America's Davos set. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=664.0s)]
*  There was supposed to be a debate tonight. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=670.0s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=674.0s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=675.0s)]
*  ABC and CNN both canceled the Republican primary debates. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=676.0s)]
*  They had scheduled ahead of next Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire after Donald Trump and Nikki Haley declined to participate. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=679.0s)]
*  Now, Trump also skipped the previous debates and nevertheless won Iowa with 51 percent of the vote. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=686.0s)]
*  Nikki Haley has absolutely zero reason to do single combat with Ron DeSantis, who's way behind her in New Hampshire. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=692.0s)]
*  The Granite State looks to be make or break for Haley's campaign. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=698.0s)]
*  She's hoping independence will break for her. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=701.0s)]
*  The latest tracking polls are not looking amazing. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=703.0s)]
*  So no more debates, no more drama for once. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=706.0s)]
*  A lack of drama might work to Trump's advantage. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=710.0s)]
*  Jennifer Horn is the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party who left the Republican Party in 2020. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=713.0s)]
*  Brendan Buck served as counsel to Speaker Paul Ryan and press secretary, Speaker John Boehner, and they both joined me now. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=719.0s)]
*  Jennifer, let me start with you as someone who knows New Hampshire politics. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=725.0s)]
*  What is your read on how things are looking there as we are just a few days away from the primary? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=728.0s)]
*  Well, I would say that I don't I don't see I don't see things going well for Nikki Haley. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=735.0s)]
*  I think that dropping out of the debates was a big mistake. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=741.0s)]
*  Frankly, she seems to have forgotten that debates aren't supposed to be about the candidates. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=744.0s)]
*  They're about the voters. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=749.0s)]
*  And in New Hampshire, there's a strong sense of wanting maximum exposure to the candidates, getting maximum information from them. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=750.0s)]
*  And she needed something big and bold and different in order to kind of make up that gap between her and Donald Trump. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=759.0s)]
*  And she's just not doing it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=767.0s)]
*  Instead, what we're seeing are the numbers that came out yesterday. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=768.0s)]
*  Post Iowa actually have Trump higher. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=771.0s)]
*  He's over 50 percent in at least two of them. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=773.0s)]
*  And the gap between them is growing. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=775.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=778.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the things, Brendan, one of the things that sort of the question here is about independents who it's not affiliate voters can vote in the New Hampshire primary. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=779.0s)]
*  All the polling suggests those folks are much more amenable to Haley than Trump. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=788.0s)]
*  But Republicans are much more amenable to Trump. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=792.0s)]
*  This, of course, is not anything new. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=794.0s)]
*  And New Hampshire has a wrinkle because there might be a lot of independent voters, but it's still, as DeSantis said, an uphill climb to win a Republican primary if you're not winning a majority of Republican voters. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=797.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=807.0s)]
*  You have to be a conservative to win the primary. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=810.0s)]
*  And I think Nikki Haley is certainly a conservative. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=813.0s)]
*  The problem is, though, that she has developed a bit of a reputation as being a never Trumper at this point. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=816.0s)]
*  And that's really working against her. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=822.0s)]
*  And her unfavorables are way higher than you would like to see. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=824.0s)]
*  It's the catch 22 that any of these Republicans had. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=827.0s)]
*  You need to go after your opponent. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=830.0s)]
*  You need to go after Donald Trump if you're going to take him down. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=832.0s)]
*  And they failed to do that. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=835.0s)]
*  But if you do, like Chris Christie did, you become wildly unpopular with a lot of Republicans. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=836.0s)]
*  So there's no real good, safe place to go. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=842.0s)]
*  Now, ignoring him, I don't think puts the right path. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=844.0s)]
*  I think we'll look back and say that that was a big failure on all of their parts. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=847.0s)]
*  But just to be clear, there was no easy way to beat Donald Trump. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=851.0s)]
*  He was probably always going to be the nominee. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=855.0s)]
*  But they clearly didn't bring any game changing strategies that put that in question. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=857.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to your point, I think you're right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=862.0s)]
*  Like to the degree of some sort of like taint of being a never Trumper has sort of wafted over Nikki Haley, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=865.0s)]
*  it's because she's running against Trump and doing decently well, hence competing with him. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=872.0s)]
*  And as a logical matter, that must be the case. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=877.0s)]
*  Right. Like this is the sort of inescapable by Jennifer that everyone is found. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=880.0s)]
*  And I mean, it's the reason that you left the Republican Party fundamentally. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=886.0s)]
*  I think there's some question of like, oh, does the makeup of New Hampshire voters like this is the St. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=890.0s)]
*  Anson poll just to show it, you know, among registered Republicans, Trump's up by 40.6525 to say he's eight among undeclared. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=894.0s)]
*  It's Haley 52, Trump 37 to Santa's four. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=902.0s)]
*  But again, it doesn't you don't think there's going to be enough of those latter category in order to tip the balance? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=906.0s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=913.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to me to hear the idea that Nikki Haley is being looked at as a never Trumper and that that's what's keeping her down. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=916.0s)]
*  Nikki Haley served in his administration. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=925.0s)]
*  Nikki Haley has already committed her vote to Donald Trump. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=927.0s)]
*  Should he become the nominee? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=930.0s)]
*  But the I think the issue here is less about Nikki Haley and more about Donald Trump. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=933.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's support in the Republican Party has been unwavering for eight years now. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=938.0s)]
*  To Buck's point, there was never a chance that anyone other than Donald Trump was going to be the nominee. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=945.0s)]
*  And Nikki Haley simply hasn't shown, I guess, the courage that is necessary to take on Trump in a way that would actually impact his support within the voter base. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=953.0s)]
*  And in the primary, no matter what those undeclared voters do in the end, the as you just showed in the numbers, the Republicans overwhelmingly want Trump. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=965.0s)]
*  Brendan, to stay with us for a second, there was a moment where people and again, we don't know what will happen on Tuesday. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=978.0s)]
*  It's possible the voters surprise us. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=984.0s)]
*  I was in New Hampshire in 2008 when everyone had written the obituary for Hillary Clinton's campaign and it didn't work out that way. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=986.0s)]
*  She won that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=992.0s)]
*  She won that primary that led to a very, very long extended primary fight between Barack Obama and her. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=993.0s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=999.0s)]
*  That said, there was a reason people didn't think they could dislodge him back after the 2022 midterms. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1001.0s)]
*  There was a reason all those people got in the race and his polling reflected it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1008.0s)]
*  Like, do you think I guess the question is like how inevitable were things turning or were there missed opportunities earlier on? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1012.0s)]
*  So I think there's a couple of missed opportunities. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1020.0s)]
*  One, I think it was a huge failure not to somehow draw him into any of the previous debates. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1022.0s)]
*  He had no reason to debate, but they ignored him at the debate. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1027.0s)]
*  They didn't try to use his ego against him in any way. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1030.0s)]
*  But I think probably more than anything, there was really no appetite at any point for that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1034.0s)]
*  So, you know, this was this was probably an uphill climb from the very beginning. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1040.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens on Tuesday. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1045.0s)]
*  Jennifer Horn and Brendan Buck. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1046.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1047.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb944_oqTW8&t=1060.0s)]
