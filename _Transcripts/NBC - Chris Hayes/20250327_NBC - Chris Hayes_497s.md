# Trump yanks Elise Stefanik’s Cabinet nomination, citing ‘very tight’ GOP majority
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk)
*  Congresswoman and UN ambassador, designate Elise Stefanik, began her farewell tour at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=0.0s)]
*  Quaker Springs Fire Department to thank those who voted her in to represent the 21st district [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=7.2s)]
*  10 years ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=12.8s)]
*  As we begin to close this incredible chapter and embark on a new one, and I look around [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  this room, it's going to be hard for me to get through this without crying. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=20.48s)]
*  Well for weeks, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has been getting ready for her new [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=25.92s)]
*  job as Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=29.8s)]
*  All she had to do was sail through Senate confirmation and she'd be on her way. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  She gave up her House committee assignments. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=37.46s)]
*  She even started posting reminiscences of her time in Congress, sentimental throwbacks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=39.1s)]
*  to her decade-long evolution from a moderate conservative to a loyal MAGA foot soldier [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=44.24s)]
*  pandering to Trump at every chance. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=49.58s)]
*  And it was paying off. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  She was just days away from moving on up into the UN ambassador's deluxe apartment [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=53.3s)]
*  on the east side, a full-floor, 6,000 square foot penthouse condo with commanding views [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  of Manhattan and the East River, large staff, cabinet-level appointment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=64.42s)]
*  But Stefanik got some bad news today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=69.78s)]
*  We're going to need you to go ahead and stay in the House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=72.38s)]
*  Trump withdrew her nomination to the UN in order to keep her in her spot in Congress. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=75.74s)]
*  And it's because he and Republicans are freaked the heck out about how narrow their House [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=81.46s)]
*  majority is. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=86.5s)]
*  Quote, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=87.5s)]
*  It is essential we maintain every Republican seat in Congress he posted today with a very [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=88.5s)]
*  tight majority. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat, but people love [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  Elise and with her, we have nothing to worry about come election day. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=97.78s)]
*  Now Stefanik's House seat is rated an R plus 10. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=102.13999999999999s)]
*  She won in 2024, I think by like 21 points. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=104.74s)]
*  And Trump was worried that another Republican might lose that seat. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=107.96s)]
*  Next Tuesday, they are defending two very deep red house districts in Florida. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=113.5s)]
*  But the race for one of those, a seat once held by National Security Advisor Michael [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Waltz, the guy who started the text chain with, you know, Jeffrey Goldberg, that's turning [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=120.8s)]
*  out to be far more competitive than party expected. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=125.28s)]
*  And that comes on the heels of the Democrats upset victory in a special election for a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=128.54s)]
*  Pennsylvania state Senate seat. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately for Elise Stefanik, there's a palpable feeling out there that the mythical [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  massive Trump mandate is gone. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=138.84s)]
*  Melanie Zanonis, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent who has been covering this story and she joins [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  me now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, Melanie, I got to say we knew early on in the lame in the sort of transition period [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  where Trump was announcing these various members of Congress. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  This could be a problem. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=156.86s)]
*  Waltz, Gates dropped out, right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=158.28s)]
*  But this just shocked me today. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=160.68s)]
*  I had no idea this was coming. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  How did it come about? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=164.04s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=165.64s)]
*  The concern about the narrow house majority has been something that has been a concern [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  since day one. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=171.64s)]
*  In fact, in fact, Speaker Mike Johnson even warned President Donald Trump, please don't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  take any members from the House. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=177.04s)]
*  Don't take any more members because we can't afford to lose them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=178.6s)]
*  But I think what's happening here is that the big picture is Trump is realizing just [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  how hard it is to govern with a razor thin majority. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  And based on my reporting, there were a couple dynamics at play here that really fueled this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=188.32s)]
*  decision. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=194.04s)]
*  The big one being that there is a special election next week. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=195.04s)]
*  As you mentioned, there's two races that are up to fill two of these Republicans that had [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=198.32s)]
*  left Congress early to work for the Trump administration. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  And one of those races is a lot closer and a lot more competitive than Republicans thought [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  it would be. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  This was supposed to be a seat that Trump won by 30 points. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  But the Republican candidate there, Randy Fine, has been massively outraised by his Democratic [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  opponent. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=218.72s)]
*  He was really slow to get on the airwaves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=219.72s)]
*  Trump is at a swoop in. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  He's doing a tele town hall for the candidate tonight. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=222.88s)]
*  The GOP leadership has had to get involved. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=224.72s)]
*  And so I think all of that, based on my reporting, has really spooked Donald Trump about the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=227.24s)]
*  ideas of more special elections potentially. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, Elise Svante, if she left, they would have to defend that seat. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=235.16s)]
*  And it is slightly less random than the one that you're trying to defend on Tuesday. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=238.36s)]
*  So I think all of that, his frustration with Mike Waltz about Signalgate, about this seat, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=242.08s)]
*  has all kind of bled into this decision making, combined with the fact that they are still [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=246.8s)]
*  trying to push through this massive, sweeping domestic policy agenda with these razor thin [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=251.48s)]
*  margins. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump is finally starting to realize exactly how hard it is going to be to govern. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=258.12s)]
*  And he is starting to really realize just what Mike Johnson said, which is they can't [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=262.76s)]
*  afford to lose any more members. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=267.0s)]
*  I think Trump underestimated potentially initially how easy this was going to be for him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=268.52s)]
*  Yeah, that Florida race, the gentleman there is a Florida state legislator named Randy [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=273.24s)]
*  Fine, who is a Republican who was sort of going to cruise to victory in that seat. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=278.64s)]
*  His Democratic opponent, I think Josh Wales, his name, if I'm not mistaken, he's raised, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  out raised him nine to one. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  But also, you had Rick DeSantis today, sorry, Ron DeSantis, who is that guy again? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=292.4s)]
*  You had Ron DeSantis today basically like refusing to say Randy Fine's name and already [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=299.28s)]
*  getting out ahead of like if he loses, it's not Donald Trump's fault. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is a plus 30 seat. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=309.28s)]
*  Like this should not be close at all in no way, no how. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely a lot of expectation setting going on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=316.64s)]
*  The same message was delivered through the leadership today during or earlier this week, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  excuse me, during a closed door meeting where they tried to warn, listen, this is a special [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=324.48s)]
*  election. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=328.32s)]
*  It's not the same. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=329.32s)]
*  Don't read too much into it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=330.32s)]
*  It is going to be closer than we thought. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=331.32s)]
*  But this has nothing to do with Donald Trump or the GOP. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=332.52s)]
*  And I will tell you, based on other reporting that I had done earlier this week, the candidate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=335.84s)]
*  himself seems to be a very problematic candidate. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=340.24s)]
*  He's very polarizing, even amongst Florida Republicans. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  Like I said, he didn't get up on the airwaves until recently. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=346.56s)]
*  That being said, I am told that Donald Trump, even though they're confident this guy is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=350.52s)]
*  going to win, Donald Trump does not like this narrative. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  He thinks it's he thinks it's making the entire party look bad, including himself. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=357.52s)]
*  So obviously, they want this candidate to win and to win by big margins. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  But it's certainly not a good narrative for Republicans. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=365.6s)]
*  Right. And I mean, when you think about I mean, we had on James Malone as a state Senate [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=369.16s)]
*  candidate who won in a seat that's been controlled by Republicans for like over 100 years, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=373.8s)]
*  more or less in the heart of honors country in Lancaster. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=378.08s)]
*  That was Trump plus 15. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=381.12s)]
*  Anyone by a point, that's a 16 point swing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=383.2s)]
*  If you're looking at the Sephonic district, it's not the sort of home turf of Florida, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=385.8s)]
*  but it's in New York. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=390.08s)]
*  It's a Trump district. But again, like that looks a lot more difficult. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=391.32s)]
*  And this says to me, it's the first indication I've seen at all in two months that they [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  realize public opinion is a real thing, that they can't just do whatever and there will [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=402.0s)]
*  just be nothing on the other side of it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think behind the scenes, there's probably a lot more going on that we probably [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=411.0s)]
*  don't even know here. That was my first thought when they decided to pull this withdrawal [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=415.28s)]
*  or pull this nomination withdraw. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=419.72s)]
*  It was they must be seeing something that we're not even perhaps publicly with. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=421.04s)]
*  Stefanic seat in particular, I would point out it used to not be a super conservative [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=426.44s)]
*  district. It's gotten more red in recent years, but she also herself has evolved as the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZU0weoVxk&t=430.56s)]
