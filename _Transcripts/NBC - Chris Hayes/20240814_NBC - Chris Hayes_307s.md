# Harris makes fighting high prices a campaign issue
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4)
*  In fact, in a new campaign ad, she's directly addressing voters' concerns about high prices. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=0.0s)]
*  She grew up in a middle-class home. She was the daughter of a working mom, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=7.28s)]
*  and she worked at McDonald's while she got her degree. Kamala Harris knows what it's like to be [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=11.68s)]
*  middle-class. It's why she's determined to lower health care costs and make housing more affordable. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=16.56s)]
*  Health care costs are a perennial campaign issue, particularly for Democratic candidates, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=23.6s)]
*  but I honestly can't recall another Democratic nominee putting housing costs [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=26.8s)]
*  front and center to a presidential campaign in my lifetime. And for all the advice from Republicans [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=31.76s)]
*  that Donald Trump needs to stop attacking Harris' race and crowd sizes and focus on those pocketbook [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=37.28s)]
*  issues where he had an advantage over Biden, he's not actually capable of engaging on the substance. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=42.72s)]
*  We saw that last week when Trump got a surprising question from one of his very own MAGA faithful [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=48.88s)]
*  live on Trump TV. What are you going to do about bringing down the rent and things like that in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=54.8s)]
*  the economy? Because out of eight children that I'm a father and a stepfather to, five of them are [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=61.28s)]
*  struggling and I'm giving them part of my income on a regular basis. How are you going to make the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=67.36s)]
*  economy not just the food and electricity, but bring down the rent prices, the housing prices, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=74.0s)]
*  so that these kids can survive? Now take a moment to appreciate this man and his question. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=83.12s)]
*  Diehard Trump supporter says so on his American flag biker cut. And for all the things that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=89.68s)]
*  right wing pundits assume guys like this care about, migrant caravans, Bud Light boycotts, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  and groomers, he simply wanted to know what Donald Trump would do to bring down rents [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=99.92s)]
*  so his adult kids could afford lives of their own. It's a good question. It's a real problem. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Rental costs and he's looking for a solution. That is how politics should work. Now the Kamala [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=111.52s)]
*  Harris answer this question, which we may hear more about in her economic policy speech Friday in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=117.2s)]
*  North Carolina, is to reigning corporate landlords and actually to cap rent for those corporate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=121.52s)]
*  landlords, cap rent increases while also boosting the construction of new affordable housing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=126.72s)]
*  So she has genuine concrete policy proposals. That's Harris. Now let's listen to Donald Trump's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=133.12s)]
*  answer and his policy proposals. How are you going to make the economy, not just just the, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=139.36s)]
*  you know, the food and electricity, but bring down the rent prices, the housing prices so that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  these kids can survive without their parents help? Such a good question. You're right. I hear it very [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=154.8s)]
*  well. And I tell you, first of all, I love the people that you with. I know that I must have at [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=162.4s)]
*  least 99, perhaps 100% of all of them. And I think they're incredible. We are going to drill, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=166.8s)]
*  baby drill. We're going to bring down the cost of energy. Energy is what caused the worst inflation, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=173.12s)]
*  I think, in the history of our country. Food prices are up 50%. Sometimes more. You look at bacon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=178.08s)]
*  Bacon is quadrupled. You can't order bacon. You can't order anything. We're living horribly. We [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  have the worst inflation we've probably ever had in our country. And it started because of energy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=189.52s)]
*  We're going to drill, baby drill. And then we're going to have China and all of these countries [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=194.88s)]
*  that were treating us good when I was there toward that. I mean, by the — it took me a long time to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=199.28s)]
*  get them to behave properly. All of these countries are going to, again, stop like four years ago. I [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=204.24s)]
*  could ask you. You were in great shape. You had low energy costs. You had low food costs. Everything [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=210.72s)]
*  was good. You could buy a house. You had low interest rates, 2% interest rates. You had gasoline [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=216.24s)]
*  at $1.87. Now it's $5. And by the way, going up and going up very substantially. But you had gasoline [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=222.24s)]
*  at $1.87 a gallon. Nobody talks about that anymore. Nobody even can believe it's going to happen. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  It's going to happen again. All right. So much of that, our lies and errors, including the $1.87, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=235.52s)]
*  and also like COVID was happening, particularly the Sturgis rally. Remember that? But again, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  that's his answer. Like a word salad dressed up with lies and self-congratulations and bacon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=249.44s)]
*  I mean, the guy, again, was very specific. He wanted to know about Trump would do not just [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=256.4s)]
*  electricity and food, about rent costs. And what he gets is drill, baby, drill, and China will be [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=260.32s)]
*  nice to us. And I never got credit for anything. How will that bring the rent prices down? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=265.36s)]
*  No wonder Financial Times poll this week showed voters trust Harris more than Trump on the economy, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=271.52s)]
*  a first for a Democrat since Time started polling. No wonder Trump keeps ignoring his [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=276.56s)]
*  aides' campaign advice to talk more about his policies. He doesn't really have any. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuA0bc8Kog4&t=281.6s)]
