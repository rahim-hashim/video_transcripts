# 'Absurdly overdramatic': Republicans react to Katie Britt’s State of the Union response
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg)
*  On paper, Senator Katie Britt was an excellent choice to deliver the response to the State [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Union. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=5.44s)]
*  At 42 years old, she is the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the Senate, the first [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=6.44s)]
*  woman senator from Alabama. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=11.6s)]
*  Britt's a mother of two. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  She's married to a former NFL player. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=14.72s)]
*  She's widely considered to be a rising political star with genuine political acumen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=16.4s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina even suggested that, quote, she represents the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=22.04s)]
*  future of the Republican Party. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=25.28s)]
*  The party clearly expected her to knock it out of the park. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=27.58s)]
*  New York Times reports that a close ally of Senator Britt sent talking points to conservative [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=31.38s)]
*  influencers ahead of the speech, suggesting words of praise, including, quote, she came [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=35.82s)]
*  off like America's mom. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=40.26s)]
*  She gets it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=41.9s)]
*  They compared her response to Ronald Reagan's famous Berlin Wall speech and described it [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=43.099999999999994s)]
*  as reminiscent of his message of that shining city on a hill. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=46.58s)]
*  Before she uttered a single word, the author of these talking points declared that Britt's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=51.14s)]
*  speech was pitch perfect. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=55.1s)]
*  For the first 60 seconds or so, the speech had seemed fine. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=57.78s)]
*  She was smiling at her kitchen table, talking about the future of America, but it quickly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=61.78s)]
*  took a real turn. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=66.5s)]
*  We see you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=69.98s)]
*  We hear you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=72.22s)]
*  And we stand with you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=74.94s)]
*  Daily Beast described the speech as, quote, bizarrely delivered with an over the top dramatic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=78.98s)]
*  cadence that left political operatives and observers struggling to make sense of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=83.06s)]
*  The performance was so bad that Republicans, some Republicans watched the high profile [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=87.26s)]
*  speech with a grimace. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=91.62s)]
*  According to one strategist, everyone's effing losing it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=93.5s)]
*  It's one of our biggest disasters ever. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=96.42s)]
*  Rolling Stone was inundated with messages absolutely torturing Britt's absurdly over [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=98.86s)]
*  dramatic rebuttal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=103.98s)]
*  A Trump adviser wrote, quote, what the hell am I watching right now? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=105.58s)]
*  A Republican pollster called it creepy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  And a senior House congressional aide described it as cringe inducing to watch and likely [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=111.46s)]
*  destined to be turned into a lame Saturday Night Live skit this weekend. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=115.58s)]
*  I think that's a fair prediction, though. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=119.14s)]
*  It might not be lame. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=120.86s)]
*  The conversation was similar on social media, where conservative activist Charlie Kirk received [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=122.42s)]
*  a lot of replies to his post asking his followers if they liked Britt's speech. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=126.1s)]
*  Alan Sanders compared it to a B-grade Hallmark movie moment with an unknown actress playing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=130.54s)]
*  the lead. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=135.26s)]
*  Stacey in the USA wrote, very babysitter reading a bedtime story like. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=136.34s)]
*  Zeon 45 said, reminded me when a person spoke on Sesame Street. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=140.82s)]
*  And on Real America's Voice, the right wing hosts were stunned into silence. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=146.06s)]
*  May God bless you and may God continue to bless these United States of America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=152.62s)]
*  I'm sure she's very nice. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=166.26s)]
*  And I don't want to I don't want to get like over the top here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=181.54s)]
*  But that is the everything about that on a night like tonight is wrong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=185.89999999999998s)]
*  A reaction that may best represent the Republican Party came from the senior senator from Alabama [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=191.14s)]
*  former football coach Tommy Tuberville. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=196.24s)]
*  Well considering the circumstance, I think I thought she did very well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=199.88s)]
*  And you know, she's a mom. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  She's a housewife. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=205.36s)]
*  She's around people in a young age. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=206.36s)]
*  That housewife is his colleague, the first female senator from the state of Alabama. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=211.56s)]
*  And remember, the clear intention of choosing Katie Britt to deliver the response was to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=219.0s)]
*  the deficit Republicans are facing among women voters and anger about their abortion policy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't think they quite accomplished that last night. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvasDkMWdXg&t=229.7s)]
