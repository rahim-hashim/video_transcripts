# 'Radicalized' Paul Pelosi attacker takes stand, testifies on right-wing conspiracies
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA)
*  In a very busy day for President Joe Biden, who just got out of that summit and a press [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=0.0s)]
*  conference today, he's also today found time to explicitly condemn the fascist language [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=4.18s)]
*  of Donald Trump, comparing it to phrases from Nazi Germany. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=9.4s)]
*  Donald Trump made those comments at a campaign rally over the weekend, referring to his political [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=14.08s)]
*  opponents as, quote, vermin. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=18.0s)]
*  I think it's important to note that Donald Trump isn't just echoing fascist language, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=20.56s)]
*  which has been kind of the theme of the coverage. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=24.8s)]
*  He is specifically choosing his words in an effort to dehumanize his enemies and target [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=26.4s)]
*  them for violence. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=32.36s)]
*  Vermin are animals who cause problems and disease and need to be trapped and killed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  That is what you are implying when you call other human beings, your political foes, your [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=41.62s)]
*  fellow citizens, your fellow Americans, vermin. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=45.92s)]
*  That is fascist language. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Using that language is fascist. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=50.8s)]
*  Sadly, none of this is theoretical or abstract. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=53.92s)]
*  Political violence has been a through line in the Trump era, starting from his earliest [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=57.92s)]
*  rallies when the ex-president explicitly endorsed and encouraged violence against protesters. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=61.68s)]
*  At the conclusion of his presidency, he incited a violent mob to sack the Capitol. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=68.16s)]
*  Recently, he has been fixated on a particularly ghastly example of political violence, the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=74.12s)]
*  attack on former speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, last October. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=78.96s)]
*  Over a year later, the perpetrator of that attack is now on trial, and his testimony [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=85.88s)]
*  has not received anywhere near the enough attention. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  And it deserves that attention because the story of this attack is a story of precisely [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  how right-wing political violence comes about in this country in this moment, in the age [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  of Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=104.36s)]
*  Remember, it was just over a week before the midterm elections last fall when we learned [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=107.72s)]
*  of a violent invasion at the home of then-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  82-year-old Paul Pelosi underwent surgery today after being struck with a hammer, suffering [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  a skull fracture in the early morning attack. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=123.56s)]
*  His alleged assailant, a 42-year-old man charged tonight with attempted homicide, the intruder [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  allegedly demanding to see the speaker. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=132.8s)]
*  Senator Pelosi, second in the presidential line of succession, as we noted, was not home [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=135.8s)]
*  at the time of the attack. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=140.72s)]
*  And though police say a motive has not been determined, the circumstances of the assault [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  are only deepening the chill felt by many in Congress in what authorities say is a more [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  threatening political climate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  It was an incredibly upsetting situation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=155.28s)]
*  It did appear from the very beginning the attack was likely political in nature. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  And that became increasingly clear as more details started to emerge. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  The assailant himself, 42-year-old David De Pape, told police that he broke into the home [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=164.48s)]
*  with items including zip ties, tape, rope, and a hammer intending to hold Speaker Pelosi [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=171.84s)]
*  hostage. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=177.72s)]
*  He wanted to interrogate her. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=179.04s)]
*  And if she lied, he said he was going to break her kneecaps. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  We learned about the assailant's ideology and online presence where he, quote, had been [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  drifting further into the world of far-right conspiracies, anti-Semitism, and hate, as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=189.72s)]
*  the Los Angeles Times put it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=194.28s)]
*  Quote, his screeds included posts about QAnon, an unfounded theory that former President [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=196.16s)]
*  Trump is at war with the cabal of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring and control [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=201.36s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=205.96s)]
*  And then instead of accepting those facts, we saw this concerted effort from the right [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=207.8s)]
*  wing to obfuscate exactly what happened. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=213.24s)]
*  And almost immediately, they tried to muddy the waters, to confuse people, to hide what [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=217.48s)]
*  we then knew, what was staring us in the face, that this was an example of political violence [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  inspired by the same fetid ideology that Donald Trump was using to his benefit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=226.6s)]
*  These people did everything they could to pretend this guy isn't exactly what he so [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  clearly was. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=239.28s)]
*  So they made up all sorts of disgusting stories. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=241.2s)]
*  They just, remember this? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=243.76s)]
*  They just made up the lie that the brutal attack on this man was some sort of lover's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=245.08s)]
*  quarrel, just fabricated out of thin air, just a fabrication to cover for a violent [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=251.52s)]
*  right-wing assault, a guy who had been clearly been influenced by violent right-wing rhetoric. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=257.24s)]
*  And this was not fringe. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=262.2s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=263.2s)]
*  Republican members of Congress, Trump Jr., even Elon Musk, elevated that lie. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=265.0s)]
*  They made it a central part of the discourse. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  We saw all kinds of obfuscation about the assailants' politics. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=273.62s)]
*  Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas signed onto this claim that it is absurd to try to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=279.26s)]
*  paint a hippie nudist from Berkeley as some kind of militant right-winger. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  Now, I should note here, thankfully, Paul Pelosi recovered after ongoing surgery to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=286.06s)]
*  repair a skull fracture. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=293.18s)]
*  It could have been so much worse. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=295.6s)]
*  And we should keep in mind that it was the second act of serious right-wing political [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=298.58s)]
*  violence in the run-up to an election in the Trump era. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=301.64s)]
*  The last midterms, 2018, a man who became known as the MAGA bomber mailed 16 packages [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=304.88s)]
*  containing actual pipe bombs to Democratic politicians and other critics of Donald Trump. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=309.84s)]
*  He tried to blow them up. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=314.36s)]
*  But this utterly horrifying story, which serves as a greatest warning to us all, became a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  punchline on the right among conservatives. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=322.08s)]
*  Now, I don't actually think they are joking about Paul Pelosi's violent attack because [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=324.88s)]
*  they think it's funny. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=329.92s)]
*  They are joking about it because that joking signals to their audience that what happened [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=331.76s)]
*  is fine. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=337.06s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, well, she's got protection when she's in the D.C. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=340.06s)]
*  Apparently her house doesn't have a lot of protection. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=343.0s)]
*  She's losing the gavel but finding the hammer. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=345.88s)]
*  Too soon? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  Is that too soon? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  We had no terror during my administration. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  The only terror we had was Nancy Pelosi. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  It was a crazy little thing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  She is a lunatic. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=353.2s)]
*  She is a crazed lunatic. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=354.2s)]
*  What the hell was going on with her husband? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=355.2s)]
*  Let's not answer. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=356.2s)]
*  Let's not answer. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=357.2s)]
*  I'll withdraw that statement. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=358.2s)]
*  By the way, she's got to walk around her house. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=359.2s)]
*  Obviously in that case it didn't work very well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=360.2s)]
*  That is what Donald Trump said this past weekend a few days ago. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=382.2s)]
*  It's part of the Stump speech. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=386.2s)]
*  He's still talking and joking about the 82-year-old husband of the Speaker of the House being [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=387.2s)]
*  violently assaulted with a hammer to his head causing a skull fracture. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=395.2s)]
*  He's joking about that to the audience who all laugh with him about how funny it is that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=399.2s)]
*  this man was violently assaulted. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=404.2s)]
*  And he's doing this while David De Pape is on trial in federal court in California. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=406.2s)]
*  Yesterday, he stood up to testify on her oath and describe what was clear from the beginning [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=411.2s)]
*  or should have been clear to Donald Trump and all of his allies. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=415.2s)]
*  He said he went to the Pelosi's home as part of a bigger plot to end what he viewed as [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=419.2s)]
*  government corruption. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=424.2s)]
*  And he tearfully recounted about his political leanings went from leftist to, yes, right-wing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=425.2s)]
*  After reading a comment on a YouTube video about former President Donald Trump, he became [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=431.2s)]
*  radicalized towards this right-wing violence through the MAGA cult of Donald Trump. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=438.2s)]
*  These are the real stakes, the debate about Trump's rhetoric and his fascist behavior. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=443.2s)]
*  It leads his people to believe that political violence is okay, that it's desirable, that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=447.2s)]
*  their political enemies are subhuman, and if you bash their head with a hammer, it's funny. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=451.2s)]
*  This movement has gotten people hurt and more people are going to get hurt until the movement is stopped. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu_92JJ8uTA&t=456.2s)]
