# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights March 29
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are in a race against the clock, taking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=0.0s)]
*  ever closer to election day, as Donald Trump desperately tries to delay any effort to hold [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=4.0s)]
*  him accountable for his actions. Now, at least in New York, it looks like his efforts have [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=8.64s)]
*  been unsuccessful, with a Manhattan judge ruling this week that Trump's hush money election [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=12.72s)]
*  interference trial will start on April 15th. Although the ex-president continues to put [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=17.6s)]
*  up a fight, attacking the judge's daughter continuously, now challenging the gag order [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=22.28s)]
*  imposed on him, we will talk about all of that tonight. And yet, in the other three criminal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=28.68s)]
*  cases against him, our legal system continues to move in slow motion. Crucially, in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=33.48s)]
*  most serious and most important case about Donald Trump's attempted coup leading up to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=39.12s)]
*  January 6th. In that case, the Supreme Court has basically suspended any forward motion [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=44.12s)]
*  while they take up Trump's extremely dubious claim that he is immune from any potential [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=49.84s)]
*  prosecution because he was president at the time. Whether Donald Trump will face trial [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=55.84s)]
*  for trying to overthrow our democracy before the next election is now, let me be clear [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=60.88s)]
*  here, entirely up to the court and the majority of the court and how quickly they move. The [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=66.68s)]
*  key thing to understand, and this cannot be emphasized enough, is that when the Supreme [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=72.36s)]
*  Court wants to move fast, they move fast. And when they want to move slow, they move [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  very slow. In both circumstances, they know exactly what they're doing and what the effects [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=82.92s)]
*  will be. They're not idiots. And by they, I mean the conservative majority of the court [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  that controls such matters. This week, we saw a stark example of that. When the Supreme [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=94.8s)]
*  Court tipped the scales in the race for control of the House towards Republicans by sitting [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  on their hands and just doing nothing. This comes in a case out of South Carolina. It [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=106.84s)]
*  may have escaped your notice, hasn't gotten a lot of attention where the Republican controlled [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=112.6s)]
*  legislature in that state drew this map in 2022, drastically changing the makeup of two [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  congressional districts, the first district and the sixth district. And early last year, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=122.64s)]
*  a three judge federal district judge court panel ruled the map was unconstitutionally [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=127.6s)]
*  racially gerrymandered, having moved over 30,000 African American voters from the first [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  district to the sixth. As you can see with these lines, the voting population of the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=140.2s)]
*  first district was just 17.4% black versus 46.9% in the sixth district. Now, to be clear, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=145.4s)]
*  this gets confusing with the map. The purpose was to make the district safer for, yes, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=153.84s)]
*  Trumpy Republican incumbent Congresswoman Nancy Mase. This was a Nancy Mase salvation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=160.88s)]
*  South Carolina Republicans who found their maps struck down by federal judges were not [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  going down without a fight. Of course, they appealed to the Supreme Court asking the MAGA [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=172.16s)]
*  majority to allow their map to stand. Now, let's be clear. This is nothing new. In fact, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  we've seen a lot of these fights over racially gerrymandered districts in recent years, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=182.32s)]
*  particularly after the Supreme Court struck down sections of the Voting Rights Act. So [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=186.28s)]
*  one case was in Alabama where that state's Republican controlled legislature passed this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=190.36s)]
*  congressional map in 2021. You can see just one district, the seventh in blue, was majority [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=195.32s)]
*  black. In early 2022, a federal court blocked the map, ruling that it likely violated the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  Voting Rights Act by deliberately splitting black voters across four districts, meaning [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=207.92s)]
*  that there was only one majority minority district. They told Alabama that wasn't good [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=213.44s)]
*  enough, that the Alabama legislature had to redraw the map with a second majority black [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=218.68s)]
*  district. Republicans took this case to the Supreme Court as well, where the court put it on pause [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=223.96s)]
*  back in 2022, saying it was, oh, too close the election to change the map. We don't want to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=230.44s)]
*  mess with things. Now, mind you, that was in February of 2022. The primary wasn't held until [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  late May. And so what happened? Well, back in 2022, the state of Alabama used the racially [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=241.0s)]
*  gerrymandered maps with disenfranchised black voters and cost Democrats, the ones that had [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=247.96s)]
*  already been struck down by the lower court as unconstitutional, they used those maps. And to no [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=254.6s)]
*  one's surprise, Republicans benefited because they won every district except the sole majority [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=260.44s)]
*  black district, helping to secure Republicans' tiny majority in the House. Now here's the kicker. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=266.84s)]
*  After the election was over, the Supreme Court got around to ruling on the case and ruled five [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=273.96s)]
*  to four that, oh, wow, look at that. Alabama's map did violate the Voting Rights Act and would [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=278.84s)]
*  have to be redrawn. The state of Alabama did discriminate against its black voters, and they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=284.84s)]
*  held a whole election using the discriminatory map because the Supreme Court would not make a decision [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=290.76s)]
*  nearly four months ahead of any votes being cast. Okay, this happened in 2022 in Alabama. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=296.84s)]
*  So that brings us back to South Carolina, the current litigation. In that case, the Supreme [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  Court did actually hear arguments on that case all the way back in October, October 11th. That was [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=309.0s)]
*  more than five months ago. That was when the court heard the South Carolina case. At that point, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=315.55999999999995s)]
*  the 2023 World Series had not yet begun. Yesterday was the opening day of the 2024 season. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=321.0s)]
*  When the court heard the South Carolina case, George Santos, remember that guy? He was still [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=327.56s)]
*  a member of Congress. Remember, they move quickly when they want to move quickly, when they wanted [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=331.96s)]
*  to strike down COVID restrictions or end the Biden administration's moratorium on evictions or make [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=337.8s)]
*  sure that student borrowers didn't get debt relief, they moved at lightning speed. But in this case, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=343.4s)]
*  well, they've just been sitting on this case about South Carolina's maps. No word from them, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=349.96s)]
*  making no decisions for five months now. And the congressional primary is fast approaching on June [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  11th. So guess what is going to happen? We are following some breaking news at this hour. A [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  United States Circuit Court judge has made an important ruling on the first congressional [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=366.52s)]
*  district's political boundaries. The judge has ruled that the current boundaries will be used [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=371.0s)]
*  for this year's elections. Now the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court where we are [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=375.88s)]
*  still waiting on a decision. Meanwhile, opponents asked a judge to hold this year's elections [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=380.76s)]
*  using the pre 2020 boundaries. The judge writes it would be highly inconvenient and unusual to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=386.68s)]
*  try to change district boundaries ahead of the June primary. You get that? They didn't make a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=392.76s)]
*  decision in the Supreme Court. They just ran out the clock. They just didn't do anything. And then [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=400.04s)]
*  it got so close to the election that they're going to go ahead and use the South Carolina map, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=405.72s)]
*  the map that the lower court judges evaluated and said was racist and unconstitutional [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=410.68s)]
*  because the Supreme Court just couldn't get motivated enough to hit any deadlines and rule [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=416.44000000000005s)]
*  on the case. The Supreme Court knows what it's doing. The justice has no other doing. These aren't [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  freshmen in their first few weeks of college overwhelmed by assignments trying to figure out [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=430.2s)]
*  how to get it all done. This was not an oversight. The justices know that if they don't act, the maps [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=435.64s)]
*  stay in place and the conservative majority knows that the current map will favor the Republican [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=442.36s)]
*  party and that if it's changed, it will favor the Democrats. So by not acting, they have acted. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=447.56s)]
*  By delaying, they have made something in the world happen. They think they are very clever. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=454.76s)]
*  They think they can get away with it because no one is paying attention, but we are paying attention. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=462.2s)]
*  We see what they're doing. We know the conservative majority of the Supreme Court decided to let black [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=469.16s)]
*  voters continue to be discriminated against in South Carolina this year in violation of the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=476.44s)]
*  Constitution. It seems to me that this is exactly parallel to what they are right now as I speak to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=481.8s)]
*  you trying to do with Donald Trump's case. They waited two whole weeks after Trump petitioned to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  announce that they would take the case. They then scheduled the case for the last possible day of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=494.12s)]
*  oral arguments, April 25th. And then if they sit on it long enough, well, it could basically just [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  go away. It could be too late to hold the trial before the election. And then once the issue is [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=506.6s)]
*  moved, the court could come out and rule on the merits and get credit for making the right call. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=513.4s)]
*  He's not immune. Too late for it to really matter. Just like they did in the Alabama case after the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=517.72s)]
*  election, after the Republicans had already secured a House majority by a very narrow number. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=523.64s)]
*  Maybe they will do the same thing in South Carolina too. Who knows? Find the Map actually [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=529.72s)]
*  did violate the Constitution, actually was an illegal racist gerrymander after it's too late. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=534.04s)]
*  Maybe they will find Donald Trump is not immune, but not in trying to try him before the election. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=540.92s)]
*  If I sound frustrated and angry, it's because I am. There's not a lot of recourse here with this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=547.56s)]
*  court. The only recourse we have with this court is to do this, to shine a light on the behavior and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=553.56s)]
*  make sure they know that we know exactly what they are up to. If you're wondering how far the brain [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=559.0s)]
*  worms have penetrated the minds of some Republicans, look no further than what happened in Michigan this [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=567.24s)]
*  week where an eagle eyed state representative named Matt Maddock thinks he spotted the latest [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=571.48s)]
*  frontier in the right wing horror fantasy of a migrant invasion in the United States. Maddock [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=576.6s)]
*  posted these pictures of three buses lined up near an airplane at the Detroit Metro Airport [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=581.08s)]
*  Wednesday night, writing frantically, happening right now. Three buses just loaded up with illegal [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=587.64s)]
*  invaders at Detroit Metro. Anyone have any idea where they're headed with their police escort? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=593.24s)]
*  Yes, Matt Maddock was sounding the alarm because when he sees a bus or three at an airport, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=599.24s)]
*  it must be an invasion. His post was of course reposted by the equally sharp chairman of the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  Michigan Republican Party. But, and who could see this coming, the buses were not filled with [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=610.76s)]
*  invaders. They were filled with bulldogs, the Gonzaga bulldogs to be precise. Yes, as you can [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=616.36s)]
*  see in the tweets from the Gonzaga men's basketball team, that was them triumphantly arriving in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=623.16s)]
*  Detroit to play in the NCAA Sweet 16 matchup at Little Caesars Arena tonight. There's a completely [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=628.6s)]
*  embarrassing, humiliating level of paranoia on display here. You might think a normal person [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=636.44s)]
*  might declare an oopsie and take down the post, like the chair of the party eventually did, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=641.0s)]
*  or heaven forbid, one could apologize. But Matt Maddock, an actual elected person in the state [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=645.48s)]
*  of Michigan, has not only left the post up, it is still there right now. But to anyone who's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=650.2s)]
*  pointed out his racist and offensive error, Maddock explains himself with variations of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=655.0s)]
*  sure commie and okay commie. I'm joined now by one of Maddock's Democratic colleagues in [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=659.88s)]
*  the Michigan legislature, State Senator Mallory McMorrow. Senator, it was your pointing this out [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=665.88s)]
*  that brought me to this story. How quickly do people sniff out the actual story here? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=673.08s)]
*  Almost immediately. I mean, it would be hilarious if this weren't an actual elected official, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=681.5600000000001s)]
*  but this isn't the first time he's done this. You have people like Maddock now frantically driving [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=689.08s)]
*  around the state looking for any bus as a sign of a threat. And we saw this happen in Florida. A [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=694.76s)]
*  woman posted a video following a line of yellow school buses asking questions about where these [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=700.68s)]
*  people were going, and it was runners going to a 10K. I mean, it's just like, how do you live in [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=707.3199999999999s)]
*  this paranoid universe where every single bus is a threat instead of a basketball team? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=713.4799999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. I was looking at some data the other day on the number one issue for [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=719.56s)]
*  Republican voters, and it's also been independent voters. And one thing that's really interesting [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=725.4s)]
*  is the economy was the number one issue when people were frustrated with it. But interestingly [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=729.64s)]
*  enough, it has come down precipitously for Republicans and even for independents as the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=734.84s)]
*  number one issue being replaced by immigration. And it really does feel like a bait and switch. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=740.12s)]
*  I'm curious from your position in Michigan, key battleground state and also a place that was hit [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=744.04s)]
*  very hard in the Great Recession, had a very contentious experience with COVID. If you feel [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=749.64s)]
*  like there's an active desire on the part of your Republican colleagues to just swap out [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=755.32s)]
*  what the sort of source and focus of their anger is. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=762.12s)]
*  I mean, I think part of that is right. And I think also just look no further than [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=767.72s)]
*  Donald Trump to see where this issue is. I mean, there was a bipartisan [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=772.0400000000001s)]
*  immigration reform bill in front of Congress that had wide agreement until Trump called [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=778.2800000000001s)]
*  GOP members of Congress and said, don't vote it through because we can't give Biden a win. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=784.84s)]
*  So, I mean, frankly, it's just really disgusting that they would rather have this be a talking [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  point and a political weapon than to actually solve the issue. And then what happens is you're [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=795.88s)]
*  afraid of everything. So, you know, what's going to happen when there is a group of fourth graders [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=800.6800000000001s)]
*  coming to our state Capitol on a field trip and we have some nut job run them off the road [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=806.44s)]
*  because they believe all of these lies because the Republicans don't want to be bothered with [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=811.64s)]
*  actual solutions. Yeah, I should note that the polling from Michigan shows immigration and the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=817.56s)]
*  economy tied along with preserving democracy is three of the top issues. Also, Maddox got [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  sort of a history with Trump as one of the kind of key like Trump whisperers or liaisons in the [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=830.92s)]
*  state. This reporting from the Huffington Post in 2022 that Republicans from your state say there's [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=837.4s)]
*  only one way to get the former president's attention. That's to know and support Michigan GOP co-chair [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=845.0799999999999s)]
*  Maddox, her state representative husband, Matt Maddox, and their adult children who are involved [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  in varying degrees of the couple's political endeavors. These are not, to the point, fringe [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=855.16s)]
*  characters in the Michigan Republican GOP. This isn't just like grabbing some rando. This is [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=859.4s)]
*  someone with real power in that state's party. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Mishaun Maddox is [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=865.0s)]
*  currently under investigation as one of the false electors here in Michigan and she was previously [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=870.2s)]
*  the co-chair of the state party. So this is somebody who's heavily involved, somebody who [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=875.8s)]
*  Donald Trump has their personal phone numbers and calls them regularly to interfere in our elections [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=880.92s)]
*  and to kind of seed these chaotic issues. This isn't the fringe. This is the GOP right now and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=886.52s)]
*  I think to your point about issues that matter to Michiganders, it's the economy, immigration, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=893.72s)]
*  and democracy because Michigan is a state where I think people see what's happening and want to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=898.36s)]
*  know that this election isn't going to be our last election and we're going to have a chance to vote [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=903.5600000000001s)]
*  after this year. I was struck by the fact that the new chair of the GOP, Chair Hoekstra, who won this [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=907.88s)]
*  civil war battle against the kind of extremely nutty, if I can say that, MAGA wing. But it was [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=918.5200000000001s)]
*  just, there's something about him being the sane, reasonable one who won that civil war and then [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=925.5600000000001s)]
*  retweeting this utterly paranoid tweet said a lot to me about what kind of hands the state GOP is in. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=931.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. It's not only that he retweeted it but who he retweeted it from. Mishaun Maddox [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=939.96s)]
*  walked so Christina Caramo, the previous chair of the Michigan GOP, could run and Caramo was the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=946.6s)]
*  one who accused Beyonce and just about everything else of being satanic. So, you know, Hoekstra won [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=952.44s)]
*  on this idea of returning the party to sanity but he's still looking to the Maddox as kind of his [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=959.24s)]
*  Trump whisper and that's a bad sign for the GOP. I love the eyes emoji, like not saying it's true or [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=966.28s)]
*  not, just looking at the buses of the Gonzaga Bulldogs men's team, State Senator Mallory [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=972.6s)]
*  McMorrow. Thank you very much, appreciate it. Thanks, Chris. Hey everyone, MSNBC has a new and [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQBWV53ACk&t=977.96s)]
