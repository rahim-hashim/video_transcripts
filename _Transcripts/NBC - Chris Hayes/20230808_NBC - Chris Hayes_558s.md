# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg)
*  Yes or no, did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=0.0s)]
*  Whoever puts their hand on the Bible on January 20th every four years is the winner. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=6.4s)]
*  OK, but respectfully, you did not clearly answer that question. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=11.96s)]
*  And if you can't give a yes or no on whether or not Trump lost, then how can you? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=16.12s)]
*  Of course he lost. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=21.16s)]
*  Trump lost the 2020 election? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=23.64s)]
*  Joe Biden's the president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=25.92s)]
*  Nearly three years after the 2020 election, Ron DeSantis has finally admitted that Donald Trump lost. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=28.36s)]
*  Sorta. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Now that the Florida governor's own presidential campaign is floundering and he's trailing the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=34.64s)]
*  indicted ex-president by double digits in every poll, DeSantis is willing to state the obvious. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  But where does he get off saying, of course Joe Biden's the president, of course Donald Trump lost, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  as if that's what he's been saying all along, as if DeSantis has not spent the past two and a half years [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=49.56s)]
*  hedging and passive voicing his way out of stating that exact fact, all while pushing big lie adjacent conspiracy theories [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=54.76s)]
*  about election fraud and endorsing election denying candidates for office. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=62.44s)]
*  In fact, when it comes to managing elections, in many ways, DeSantis is almost more dangerous than Trump, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=66.92s)]
*  because while Trump lies about the election in a crazy way, DeSantis actually took steps as Florida's stunt governor [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=73.16s)]
*  to suppress legitimate voters under the guise of fighting imaginary voter fraud. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=79.64s)]
*  Remember back in 2021, DeSantis signed a so-called election integrity bill, which in reality was a voter suppression law, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=84.52s)]
*  making it harder for people to vote by mail and banning anyone except poll workers from distributing food or water [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=91.08s)]
*  to people waiting in line at the polls. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=97.16s)]
*  Incidentally, NBC News does not have its own video of DeSantis signing that bill, because he blocked the ceremony to all media, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=99.8s)]
*  except his buddies at Fox, who aired it live as part of an exclusive interview. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=105.88s)]
*  And do not forget his tough guy press conference where he posed with law enforcement to brag about arresting a bunch of mostly black Floridians for alleged voter fraud. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=110.92s)]
*  The state of Florida has charged and is in the process of arresting 20 individuals across the state for voter fraud. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=121.48s)]
*  They did not get their rights restored, and yet they went ahead and voted anyways. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=133.76s)]
*  That is against the law, and now they're going to pay the price for it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=139.4s)]
*  We saw those arrests. The alleged perpetrators were confused. They had no idea what they were supposed to have done wrong. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=143.4s)]
*  And the police didn't have any answers either. Not long after that transparent PR stunt, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=149.8s)]
*  many of those cases completely fell apart for a number of reasons, following revelations that many of the folks DeSantis arrested under the guise of voting illegally [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=155.08s)]
*  had actually been told by his own state government that they were cleared to vote. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=163.4s)]
*  But if there is any small consolation here, it is that Ron DeSantis will almost certainly not be able to impose his extreme far-right agenda on America as a whole, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=169.08s)]
*  if the polls are to be believed. Because despite the governor's braggadocious promise in his pre-Campaign book, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=178.12s)]
*  which attempts to pitch his far-right agenda in the Sunshine State as a blueprint for the rest of the country, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=184.84s)]
*  it turns out most voters do not want to make America Florida. Since DeSantis took office back in 2019, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  he has lurched Florida to the far right with a series of political stunts, yes stunts, designed explicitly to appeal to Republican presidential primary voters, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  like the aforementioned stunt with the fake voter fraud allegations, or the time he callously shipped a bunch of migrants to Martha's Vineyard under false pretenses, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  a scheme that may still result in legal consequences. But DeSantis' central governing ideology, such as it exists, has been his so-called war on woke. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=216.6s)]
*  There is seemingly no conservative culture war that the governor will not take the bait on, from the ridiculous backlash to Bud Light for sponsoring an Instagram post, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=226.84s)]
*  from a transgender influencer to DeSantis' crusade against the 1619 project and teaching the truth to kids about institutionalized racism, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=235.0s)]
*  to his costly and pointless fight with Disney after it criticized his so-called don't say gay law, which restricts discussions of LGBTQ issues in Florida's classrooms. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=244.44s)]
*  But here is the thing, voters just are not buying it. In a new article today, the New York Times analyzes recent polling data, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=255.24s)]
*  which says that even the Republican base just does not care about the anti-woke stuff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=262.92s)]
*  Quote, when presented with the choice between two hypothetical Republican candidates, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=269.4s)]
*  only 24% of national Republican voters opted for a candidate who focuses on defeating radical woke ideology in our schools, media and culture over a candidate who prioritizes law enforcement and border security. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=274.12s)]
*  Among those 65 and older, often the most likely age bracket to vote, only 17% signed on to the anti-woke crusade. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=287.96s)]
*  Governor DeSantis has spent years picking these BS culture war fights, only to find that less than a quarter of the Republican base cares about any of it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=297.24s)]
*  Even Donald Trump, who never met a culture war he would not fight, even he understands the hyper fixation on woke is a losing issue. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=306.36s)]
*  The country has gone sick. It's gone sick. And I don't like the term woke because I hear woke, woke, woke. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=316.2s)]
*  You know, it's like just a term that used half the people can't even define it. They don't know what it is. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  DeSantis says he wants to make America Florida with all the culture war bigotry he's pushed there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=326.0s)]
*  And so far America has responded, no, thanks. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=331.2s)]
*  We'll have much more on the Florida governor's failure to launch and his remarkably terrible political instincts next. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=335.24s)]
*  For those of you who are soccer fans, it was a heartbreaking weekend as the US women's soccer team was defeated at the World Cup in Australia. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  Two time World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe was one of three US players to miss their penalty kicks against Sweden. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=351.52s)]
*  It was her final World Cup match. And with that, the US team, the reigning champions were eliminated. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=358.4s)]
*  But what was frankly shocking was to see people who claim to be patriots and lovers of America, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=365.24s)]
*  nationalists even just openly trashing an American national team. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=370.28s)]
*  Look at these reactions from the MAGA folks. I'm glad they lost. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=374.35999999999996s)]
*  What an embarrassment, even outright rooting for the opposing foreign team, Sweden, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=377.92s)]
*  because they say this women's team, this American women's team is too woke that Megan takes a knee during the anthem. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, grow up, guys, stop being such snowflakes and learn to love your country and your fellow Americans. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=390.6s)]
*  Still, the most deranged responsible to this World Cup defeat came from who else? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=396.88s)]
*  Donald J. Trump, the ex president who has been indicted three times and faces another possible indictment, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=401.28s)]
*  took time in between court dates to attack the women's team, claiming many of our players were openly hostile to America, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  singling out Rapinoe with nice shot, Megan, the USA is going to hell. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=413.2s)]
*  This was part of a weekend of completely unhinged social media posts that included attacks on former speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=418.4s)]
*  and her husband, who are also apparently going to hell. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=425.11999999999995s)]
*  But let's be clear, this has nothing to do with wokeness or anything else like that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=428.56s)]
*  It has to do with his petty grievances and the fact that Trump is a man who holds on to grudges, especially against women. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=431.96s)]
*  He gives it away in singling out Rapinoe. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=439.32s)]
*  Back in 2019, when Trump was in the White House and the women's team was making a run at a second consecutive World Cup title, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=441.64s)]
*  she was asked about a potential White House visit during a photo shoot. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=448.24s)]
*  Excited about going to the White House? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=453.88s)]
*  I'm not going to the White House. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=456.4s)]
*  No, not going to the White House. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=458.64s)]
*  We're not going to be invited. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=460.64s)]
*  You're not going to be invited? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=462.79999999999995s)]
*  Trump, who was president at the time and presumably had more important things to do, shot back at her writing, quote, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=465.12s)]
*  Megan should win first before she talks. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=470.4s)]
*  Well, 11 days later, that is exactly what she and the women's team did, becoming World Cup winners and skipping the White House visit. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=473.88s)]
*  So it's not about wokeness. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  It's about Trump's thin skin, which is why he went after the US women's soccer team this weekend. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  He wrote that the loss is fully emblematic of what is happening to our once great nation under crooked Joe Biden and woke equals failure. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=488.04s)]
*  But that makes no sense because nine of the 23 players, basically 40 percent of the roster, were on the World Cup winning 2019 squad. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  And five of those women were also on the 2015 winning team, including Megan Rapinoe. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  When I look at the ex president and then I look at the US women's national soccer team, I see two major differences. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=508.8s)]
*  First, this women's team won the World Cup twice. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=515.76s)]
*  Donald Trump couldn't win the presidency twice. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=519.68s)]
*  He barely won it once. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=521.84s)]
*  And second, this team, particularly Rapinoe, can handle loss with dignity and grace. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=523.52s)]
*  They can accept and own their defeat, something Donald Trump continues to remain incapable of doing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqTzwgsvFg&t=528.88s)]
