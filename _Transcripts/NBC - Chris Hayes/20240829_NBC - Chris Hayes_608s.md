# Arlington official feared 'retaliation' after altercation with Trump campaign
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Just allow yourself for a moment to imagine what would happen if Kamala Harris or Tim Walz or almost any other American politician traveled with their campaign entourage to Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, stood among the graves of the American soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan the last several decades, and got photographed grinning and giving the camera a thumbs up, then cut a campaign ad out of it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans and reporters, I think, would have gone insane. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=28.0s)]
*  Yet Donald Trump did that on Monday, and at first it really seemed to barely register. It made a little bit of a wave in the media on Tuesday, but yesterday that wave became a tsunami as we learned more details of Trump's photo op. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=32.0s)]
*  How it completely fits with Trump's vision of how America and all its institutions should serve him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=43.0s)]
*  A vision that has become the entire operating principle for Trump's Republican Party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=50.0s)]
*  We now know the Trump campaign reportedly asked Army officials for permission to attend the Monday ceremony with some families of service members killed in Afghanistan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=54.0s)]
*  Now, here's the thing. Federal law bars political activities and recordings at Arlington because, of course, the families of all 400,000 veterans and dependents buried there cannot consent to being used in a campaign ad. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=62.0s)]
*  So officials understandably, reportedly balked at Trump's plans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=77.0s)]
*  They saw what he was cooking up until they got a call from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=82.0s)]
*  That's according to multiple sources who told the Daily Caller that cemetery officials were linked into the political pressure from Republicans in Congress who wanted to make sure Trump could cut his campaign ad there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=88.0s)]
*  One source with knowledge of those calls said after the speaker's call, the situation shifted significantly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=99.0s)]
*  Okay, so the speaker calls gets them to back down even though they know exactly what's happening. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=104.0s)]
*  They're like, you can't do this. Okay, fine. Officials still told Trump's people they had to follow the cemetery rules. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=109.0s)]
*  The Army now confirms that when a cemetery worker tried to enforce those rules by stopping a Trump campaign aid from taking unauthorized photos and videos, the aid got physical with her shoving her aside. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=115.0s)]
*  Boy, it doesn't sound like a Trump aid, does it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=127.0s)]
*  According to the New York Times, that woman filed a report against the Trump aid. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=130.0s)]
*  Military police were called to the scene. But listen to this. This is a key detail. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=134.0s)]
*  But that the worker later declined to press charges. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=138.0s)]
*  Military officials told the Times she said she feared Trump's supporters pursuing retaliation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=142.0s)]
*  Now, in a statement yesterday, Trump's campaign spokesman said the woman was, and again, based on nothing, I think, suffering from a mental health episode. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=149.0s)]
*  His co-campaign manager said she was a, quote, despicable individual. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=158.0s)]
*  This is a random worker at the Arlington National Cemetery attempting to preserve the rules for that hallowed ground. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=161.0s)]
*  Now, for days, Trump stayed silent on all this. His campaign's response was left to an army of one, if you will, running mate JD Vance, who said this yesterday afternoon. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=169.0s)]
*  First of all, the altercation at Arlington Cemetery is the media creating a story where I really don't think that there is one. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=177.0s)]
*  There is verifiable evidence. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=185.0s)]
*  There is verifiable evidence that the campaign was allowed to have a photographer there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=190.0s)]
*  There is verifiable they were invited to have a photographer there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=195.0s)]
*  I'm not sure that's true, by the way, but then Vance said this yesterday evening. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=201.0s)]
*  I mean, you guys in the media, you're acting like Donald Trump filmed a TV commercial at a grave site. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=206.0s)]
*  He was there providing emotional support to a lot of brave Americans who lost loved ones they never should have lost. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=213.0s)]
*  And there happened to be a camera there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=220.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. We played this yesterday. I played it again because it's just too good. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=224.0s)]
*  There happened to be a camera there. It's not like Trump was filming a commercial there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=228.0s)]
*  It's a talking point that Trump himself took up, not surprisingly, when he finally spoke about the incident with NBC News' Dasha Burns today. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=234.0s)]
*  They like me. They called me, sir, would it be possible at my son's grave and in one case at my daughter's grave? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=242.0s)]
*  Would it be possible, sir, for you to be at Arlington? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=250.0s)]
*  I said, if it's important to you, I will be there. It's so important. We consider you our leader. It's so important. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=254.0s)]
*  And I went and you know what they said, sir? Could we have a picture at my son's grave? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=261.0s)]
*  Could we have a picture at our daughter and our sister's grave because she had her sister there? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=266.0s)]
*  It would be so great. Could we take a picture? I said, sure. I'm not thinking about a campaign. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=273.0s)]
*  He's Donald Trump. He's not thinking about a campaign. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=280.0s)]
*  He's thinking chiefly of providing emotional support to people who are in pain, which is what he spent his whole life doing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=282.0s)]
*  Obviously, it's all very spontaneous. He was just asked to take a photo of some supportive families. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=289.0s)]
*  It wasn't a film, a campaign ad, except that he also posted this video to social media. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=294.0s)]
*  We lost 13 great, great people. What a horrible day it was. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=299.0s)]
*  We didn't lose one person in 18 months. And then they took over the disaster, the leaving of Afghanistan. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=311.0s)]
*  Dozens of American service members did lose their lives in service under Donald Trump, just to be clear. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=320.0s)]
*  Dasha Burns also asked Trump about that ad. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=330.0s)]
*  Should your campaign have put out those videos and photos? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=333.0s)]
*  Well, we have a lot of people. You know, we have people, tick tock people. You know, we're leading the Internet. That was the other thing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=336.0s)]
*  We're so far above her on the Internet. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=341.0s)]
*  But on that hallowed ground, should they have put out the images of those? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=344.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know what the rules and regulations are. I don't know who did it. And it could have been them. It could have been the parents. It could have been somebody. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=346.0s)]
*  It was your campaign's tick tock that put out the video. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=353.0s)]
*  I really don't know anything about it. All I do is I stood there and I said, if you'd like to have a picture, we can have a picture. If somebody did it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=355.0s)]
*  This was a setup by the people in the administration. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=362.0s)]
*  We're leading the Internet. Also, it was your campaign. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=368.0s)]
*  Now, Trump lied in an attempt to score some crude campaign points in a context that ought to be completely beyond crude politics. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=373.0s)]
*  His partisans got rough with a civil servant who got in their way, and that civil servant ultimately dropped her complaint for fears of retribution. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=379.0s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? Does it sound a little like the story of Alexander Vindman, the soldier and National Security Council staffer who blew the whistle on Trump's attempts to extort Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=385.0s)]
*  Or maybe it reminds you of Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss, the Georgia election officials whose lies were threatened after Trump falsely accused them of rigging votes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=396.0s)]
*  Maybe it reminds you of the threats against the women who have accused Trump of sexual assault and all the public officials who have prosecuted or sue him and all the judges who have ruled against him and all the elections officials who refused to break the rules or falsify votes for him and all the Republicans who voted to impeach him. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=404.0s)]
*  In each of those cases, Trump has gotten away with intimidation, mafia-style gangster threats because rank-and-file Republicans let him, or in many cases just straight up help him, using government power to make their partisan politics a sort of official state religion and bullying anyone who gets in their way. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=420.0s)]
*  Like for instance, the volunteers for LULAC, that's the League of United Latin American Citizens, who are currently being targeted by the pro-Trump far-right Texas Attorney General. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=439.0s)]
*  Hearing from a LULAC member whose home was raided during a search authorized by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=449.0s)]
*  Now the AG's office says it's investigating alleged election fraud and efforts to register non-citizens to vote. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=457.0s)]
*  They scared the hell out of me. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=464.0s)]
*  87-year-old Lydia Martinez says she was among those targeted by the search warrants. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=466.0s)]
*  The longtime LULAC member helped senior citizens register to vote. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=471.0s)]
*  I feel that they're going to stop a lot of us from going out and doing our work, and that's what they want. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=475.0s)]
*  She said officers questioned her for hours, confiscated her phone and computer, and made her wait outside as they searched her home. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=482.0s)]
*  I said let me get dressed and she said, oh, go outside. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=490.0s)]
*  What were you wearing? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=494.0s)]
*  My nightgown. And I had all these policemen around me. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=495.0s)]
*  It was embarrassing, humiliating. I was so angry. It was horrible. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=500.0s)]
*  In the quintessential authoritarian nightmare, right? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=508.0s)]
*  The knock at the door for protected political activity, for registering people to vote. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=511.0s)]
*  So far, Ken Paxton's office has brought no charges. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=516.0s)]
*  Those Latino volunteers have written the Department of Justice saying their civil rights were violated. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=519.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans in other states like Nebraska are dragging their feet on laws approved by voters and legislators to restore felons voting rights. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=524.0s)]
*  And in Congress, another Trump ally, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, is using his power to subpoena the company that employs a daughter of the judge who's overseeing Trump's New York fraud trial. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=532.0s)]
*  OK, think of that for a second. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=544.0s)]
*  Now, ostensibly trying to tie the judge to his daughter's political work. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=546.0s)]
*  All while Trump is preparing to publish a book in which he accuses Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg of plotting against him in the 2020 election and threatening that Zuckerberg will, quote, spend the rest of his life in prison if he crosses Trump again. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=551.0s)]
*  Trump Republicans are yet again signaling. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=563.0s)]
*  Well, they're not signaling. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=565.0s)]
*  They are. They're going to do it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=567.0s)]
*  They have no use for voters or judges or federal workers or fallen veterans or even tech billionaires unless they further following a project. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=570.0s)]
*  It is a party in a movement built around a candidate for whom nothing is sacred at a military cemetery, not the judicial system, not even democracy, unless it serves his twisted aims. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=577.0s)]
*  You [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=610yvHdEU5g&t=607.0s)]
