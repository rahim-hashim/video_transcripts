# Sen. Mark Kelly shreds Hegseth for attack plans breach: ‘He crossed the line’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig)
*  And joining me now is Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, member of the Armed Services [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=4.72s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=5.72s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=6.72s)]
*  It's a little weird to be called a traitor, I think, by Elon Musk twice. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=7.72s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Well, he's the richest guy in the world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  When I was flying combat missions over Iraq, and he was probably a teenager, I didn't think [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=15.88s)]
*  a guy from South Africa, richest man in the world, would call me that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=23.14s)]
*  But I will say I'm not really bothered by it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=26.68s)]
*  But what really bothers me, it's not what he says, it's what he's doing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=29.52s)]
*  And I really, you know, crave concerns about seniors in my state. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=34.68s)]
*  When somebody calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme, especially him, with his power, that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=40.0s)]
*  means that program is under threat. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=45.56s)]
*  When veterans are fired from their jobs, we have so many veterans that after they serve, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  they go to the federal government, they get a government job, a good job. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=52.66s)]
*  Veterans are well equipped to do these jobs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=56.6s)]
*  They're mission oriented. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=58.32s)]
*  They work hard. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=60.24s)]
*  They've already served their country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=62.0s)]
*  This is a second opportunity for them to do that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  These are valuable employees. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=65.72s)]
*  I had about a dozen of them in my office a few weeks ago. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=67.28s)]
*  One guy was a disabled veteran. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=72.2s)]
*  He had recently received a performance report that said he was doing great. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=74.84s)]
*  Three weeks later, he gets an email from Elon Musk, and he's fired for poor performance. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=78.76s)]
*  This guy told me this has ruined his life. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=84.72s)]
*  He had kids. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=86.92s)]
*  He was about to start a minimum wage job. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=87.92s)]
*  You know, that point you made, the federal judge, the district judge who's overseeing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=90.8s)]
*  the lawsuit about this firing, one of the points the judge made was, first of all, they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=95.1s)]
*  know it wasn't for poor performance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=99.8s)]
*  They used it as a loophole. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  But second of all, you now have this black mark. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  Like, they know it's a lie, but you now have been fired for performance. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  You now have to answer on your next job interview, have you been fired for performance? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=108.62s)]
*  What happened to your last job with this essentially lie that the Doge Boys cooked up? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=113.96s)]
*  Well, you know, hopefully these folks will be able to explain it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=118.44s)]
*  Hey, I'm in this huge, huge group, especially for a veteran. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  He fired at least 6,000 veterans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=124.36s)]
*  That's the last time I checked. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=126.6s)]
*  That was a couple of weeks ago. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=127.6s)]
*  Maybe those folks will be able to talk about that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=129.88s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=131.92s)]
*  This is not helpful for them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=132.92s)]
*  And it is one sad story after a next, and it's not making us more efficient. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=135.4s)]
*  If you're talking about the E is efficiency and Doge, try to figure out where do we have [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=142.48s)]
*  redundancy? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=147.56s)]
*  Where do we have programs that aren't necessary? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=148.56s)]
*  U.S. government aid, the food aid that we send to starving kids, the support for programs [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=152.2s)]
*  that help strengthen democracies in other nations, that's money. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=159.76s)]
*  If we don't spend that money, at some point we're going to have to spend more money on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  bullets. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=167.94s)]
*  That point you just made, I want to stay on this for a second. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  One of the things I've seen is like, look, USAID may be good, but it's kind of people, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=172.44s)]
*  they're skeptical foreign aid and you can't really make the case. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=177.6s)]
*  You're a senator who's in a swing state, a hotly contested state. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you feel like you can just talk to people, whatever their politics are, and make an affirmative [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=184.28s)]
*  case for why USAID is actually important and shouldn't be shuttered? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=188.56s)]
*  Well, we're the richest nation in the history of the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  There are starving children all across this planet. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=196.82s)]
*  I've been in a refugee camp in the DRC in the Congo and seeing starving kids. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=200.28s)]
*  And these are kids that are now in a camp where there was care and UNICEF and food aid [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=207.32s)]
*  that comes from USAID. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=214.36s)]
*  And some of them, I remember this baby with a distended belly. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=216.56s)]
*  And I asked the doctor, well, this kid's going to be okay. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=222.36s)]
*  And he said, not this kid. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=225.84s)]
*  And if those kids over there, because we got here in time, because they got here in time, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=228.08s)]
*  this baby here will die. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=232.28s)]
*  And if that food aid wasn't there, these other kids would have died as well. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=234.52s)]
*  There are kids in Sudan and in other countries across the planet right now that are dying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=237.72s)]
*  because Donald Trump and Elon Musk decided to stop this aid. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=244.64s)]
*  And that hurts us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=250.28s)]
*  That makes these places less stable. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=251.64s)]
*  When you have instability, and it might seem like to most Americans, it's in a faraway [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=253.52s)]
*  place and it doesn't affect us. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=258.44s)]
*  The Russians are there in Africa. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=260.16s)]
*  The Chinese are there in Africa. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=261.44s)]
*  They are promoting this chaos in these foreign places. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=263.48s)]
*  Ultimately, that spreads to the rest of the part of the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=271.04s)]
*  And we wind up, as the United States of America, trying to help in these conflicts. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=275.72s)]
*  And that does affect us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=281.36s)]
*  Let me ask you another question about national security. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=283.2s)]
*  I was struck by this very well-reported piece in The Times about the signal chat leak. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=287.28s)]
*  This was talking to, particularly military pilots, about their reaction to it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=293.28s)]
*  One former senior Defense Department official with military experience said, Mr. Hegsek's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=299.0s)]
*  test describing launch times and the type of strike aircraft was indeed classified information [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=302.96s)]
*  that could have jeopardized pilots' lives if it had been released or obtained. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=307.56s)]
*  I saw a few viral TikToks of military spouses expressing rage about this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you think as a former naval aviator yourself? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=316.32s)]
*  Who had to walk out to an airplane in the middle of the night to go on a strike like [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=319.12s)]
*  this when Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense, I think. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  Never for one second did I think the Secretary of Defense was going to put me at risk. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=327.76s)]
*  And it is significant risk. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=332.44s)]
*  They're saying this wasn't classified. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=333.64s)]
*  This is the most sensitive information we have in the military. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  When you're going to send service members, troops, pilots, feet dry in this case, overland [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=339.74s)]
*  in a contested area where they have a significant surface-to-air missile capability. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=346.22s)]
*  They have SA-3s, SA-6s. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=351.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=352.02s)]
*  I've had an SA-6 blow up next to my airplane on my first combat mission. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=353.02s)]
*  That missile can shoot down an F-18 without a doubt. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=357.38s)]
*  If they know you're coming, when you're coming, the direction you're coming from, and on top [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=360.46000000000004s)]
*  of that, the time on target, they know to have all their resources focused on shooting [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=364.56s)]
*  you down. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=369.5s)]
*  And that helps them significantly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=370.78s)]
*  So of course these pilots are upset about it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=372.66s)]
*  Pete Hegseth put them at significant risk. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=375.22s)]
*  He crossed a line no Secretary of Defense should ever cross. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=378.78s)]
*  And he needs to be held accountable for this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=382.82s)]
*  What do you make of the lying? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=386.18s)]
*  I really find this part in some ways some of the most unnerving. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=387.62s)]
*  To say it's not classified, it's like, well, the timing of a surprise attack. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=391.9s)]
*  I'm not even sure what they mean by that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=396.86s)]
*  Maybe they meant because it doesn't say secret or top secret on the signal chain. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=402.46000000000004s)]
*  But of course it is. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=404.46000000000004s)]
*  It came off of a piece of paper that probably said top secret at the top. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  Or he got it over the phone from the head of CINCOM, the combatant commander, that said, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=408.82s)]
*  here's... [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=414.46000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, you look at the times, it wasn't around a certain time. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  It's like 1516, 316 p.m. or 1410, which is 210 p.m. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=419.14000000000004s)]
*  These are exact times that came from a plan. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=425.9s)]
*  Now they're saying, well, these aren't war plans. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=428.82s)]
*  I'll give them that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=431.5s)]
*  I mean, a war plan would be joint forces. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=432.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=434.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=435.62s)]
*  It would include allies. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=436.62s)]
*  This is a strike plan. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=437.62s)]
*  And these plans, by the way, are also planned by those pilots that are in the cockpit. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  So they planned the strike. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=445.5s)]
*  They communicated it to leadership. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  It got approved. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=448.9s)]
*  And then the Secretary of Defense decides to throw it out on an unsecured platform, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=450.38s)]
*  which, by the way, could have gotten to the Russians, could have gotten to the Iranians, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=455.34s)]
*  and ultimately to the Houthis. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=458.78s)]
*  It also struck me that Jim Himes, Democratic congressman, said this the other day, that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=460.02s)]
*  there was no real reason to do it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=464.14s)]
*  It was almost kind of showing off. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=467.06s)]
*  He didn't have to send that that way. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=468.96s)]
*  100%. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=470.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=471.58s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=472.58s)]
*  Or he could have sent it afterwards. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=473.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=474.58s)]
*  If that would have come out 15 minutes after those airplanes got back to the aircraft carrier, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=475.58s)]
*  those guys were safely aboard. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  If you want to send that stuff out, fine. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=481.92s)]
*  That information is not valuable to anybody anymore. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=484.5s)]
*  Not really. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=486.82s)]
*  But to do it beforehand is such a disservice to what these guys are about to do. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=488.06s)]
*  And I'm confident, I'm sure their spouses are upset. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=496.14s)]
*  It is risky to go fly an airplane into enemy territory and try to get bombs on target and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=500.1s)]
*  then get out before you get shot down. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=505.66s)]
*  And now you have the guy in the highest position in DOD is making that job so much, potentially, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=507.98s)]
*  making that job so much harder for you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=514.5s)]
*  There is reporting today that he's hired his brother at the Department of Defense, Pete Hegsaf, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=517.46s)]
*  to do a liaison, I think is what he's doing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=521.14s)]
*  What's his brother's background? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=525.22s)]
*  I think he might have had a podcast company. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=526.74s)]
*  I'm not, don't quote me on that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=528.82s)]
*  I think that's what it was. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=530.62s)]
*  This is a guy who said he's going to bring Merritt back to the Department of Defense, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=532.62s)]
*  fired the chair of the Joint Chiefs because he was too woke, I guess. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  Black man who talked about being black in America. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=541.58s)]
*  And do you think he's restoring Merritt to the Department of Defense? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=544.3s)]
*  With hiring his brother who probably needed a job or maybe gave him a raise from his previous [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=547.2199999999999s)]
*  job or wants to have his brother around. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=551.74s)]
*  How could his brother possibly be the most qualified job for whatever this is, whatever [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=553.66s)]
*  this job happens to be? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=559.5s)]
*  It's not his brother. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=561.06s)]
*  If you need somebody in this position, advertise the position and find the most qualified person. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=562.56s)]
*  This is the Department of Defense we're talking about. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=567.8599999999999s)]
*  This is the organization that keeps all of us safe. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3cLFe_Fuig&t=570.3s)]
