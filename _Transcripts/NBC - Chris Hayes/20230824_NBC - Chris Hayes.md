# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Aug. 23
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc)
*  Tonya Miller is a Georgia state representative who served as a prosecutor in the Fulton County [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=0.0s)]
*  District Attorney's Office alongside Fonny Willis, and she joins me. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=4.8s)]
*  Now, first I just want to ask about these motions made by both Jeffrey Clark and Mark [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=8.72s)]
*  Meadows to not just remove the case to federal court, but to not have to appear in Fulton [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=15.3s)]
*  County jail and be processed at all. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=20.96s)]
*  What do you make of those? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=25.72s)]
*  Are you surprised or not surprised by the judge's ruling that they can't do that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=26.72s)]
*  Chris, no, I was not surprised that they asked for that, and I also was not surprised that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  the judge denied that fairly swiftly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=38.48s)]
*  As we know, and we've been talking about, these motions to remove the case from state [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=41.44s)]
*  court to federal court center around this idea that they were sort of federal employees [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=45.84s)]
*  are acting at the behest of federal employees doing federal business when they were allegedly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=51.24s)]
*  colluding to steal the election down here in Georgia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=57.74s)]
*  I think that motion is going to be denied eventually. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=62.28s)]
*  What they did, though, recently was ask Judge Jones, who is an Obama appointee, a fairly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=65.8s)]
*  straight middle of the road, moderate federal judge, a real stickler for the rules, as most [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=72.12s)]
*  federal judges are. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=78.72s)]
*  They asked the judge to stop Fonny Willis from arresting Mark Meadows as he litigated [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=80.14s)]
*  his motion to have the case removed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=87.06s)]
*  Of course, there's no basis in the law or statute for that kind of freezing, and Judge [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=89.18s)]
*  Jones swiftly told them that, look, there is nothing in the removal statute that would [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=94.14s)]
*  allow me to stop Fonny Willis from arresting you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=97.94s)]
*  We will get to your motion in due time as it is scheduled for next week, but in the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=101.82s)]
*  meantime, you're on your own as it relates to that arrest warrant that's pending in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=105.5s)]
*  Fulton County. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=109.1s)]
*  It's funny you said that because when I saw that they had filed those motions, I asked [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=111.05999999999999s)]
*  my wife, who's a law scholar and legal expert, I was like, wait, can you do that? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  She's like, I don't think there's much there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  I don't think you can. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  You can file your motions after you've turned yourself in and been arrested, but that's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  probably a bridge too far. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=127.61999999999999s)]
*  Do you think ... What do you anticipate in terms of the scene in Fulton County tomorrow, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=128.78s)]
*  obviously with the ex-president showing up, obviously, this is folks with quite a retinue. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=135.3s)]
*  There's security issues, but it seems like they've hammered out something that they can [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=141.54s)]
*  get this done tomorrow. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=145.7s)]
*  Well, certainly, Chris, I expect it to be somewhat of a circus. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=146.7s)]
*  We already have tons of cameras and attention and protesters and supporters all descending [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=152.34s)]
*  on the Fulton County courthouse and the Fulton County jail. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=158.5s)]
*  I think with the surrendering of the former president, we should see more of that, but [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=162.5s)]
*  I suspect all of the details have been worked out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  The former president will probably pretty smoothly get into the jail, get booked, get [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=172.22s)]
*  fingerprinted, get his photo taken, his mugshot taken, and be out pretty quickly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=177.22s)]
*  But listen, this is a historic day, not just for Fulton County, not just for Georgia, but [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  for the United States of America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=190.54s)]
*  We have a former president who is being booked into the Fulton County jail, actually the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=192.14s)]
*  busiest jail in the state of Georgia, one of the busiest jails in this country for serious [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=197.3s)]
*  felony charges. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=204.06s)]
*  I expect this will not be a regular day in Fulton County tomorrow, but the folks who [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=206.58s)]
*  show up and do their jobs every day will do what they've been doing, and that is trying [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=211.74s)]
*  to play the hand that they've been dealt and make this move as smoothly as possible [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=216.06s)]
*  for everybody involved. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=220.3s)]
*  All right, Tanya Miller, thank you as always for your time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=221.3s)]
*  Temi Dayo, Agonga Williams, a former federal prosecutor who served as a senior investigative [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=225.94s)]
*  counsel on the January 6th Committee. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=229.66s)]
*  Katherine Christian, former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  and they join me now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=235.02s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=236.46s)]
*  Glad to be here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=237.46s)]
*  As someone who worked in that Manhattan DA's office, can we talk about the mugshot? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=238.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=241.94s)]
*  I'm of two minds about the mugshot. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=242.94s)]
*  I remember having conversations with people where I realized that mugshot is a very American [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=246.02s)]
*  thing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=249.26s)]
*  I don't have mugshots in other countries. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=250.26s)]
*  It always seems in the way that it's used in the New York Post and in the tabloids and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=252.86s)]
*  run, it sort of presumes guilt in its form. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=257.5s)]
*  The mugshot looms. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=262.54s)]
*  It looms on the cover of tabloids. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=264.02s)]
*  There's always something to me that's gross about the use of that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=266.26s)]
*  At the same time, it's been notable that Donald Trump has not had to face the music on that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=268.82s)]
*  score. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=273.58s)]
*  It's a small thing, but watching this does feel like there's, in terms of how Fonny Wells [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=274.82s)]
*  is handling this, there's a real kind of like equal justice under law kind of vibe here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=279.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=285.02s)]
*  So the other three indictments, Mr. Trump, a mugshot wasn't taken. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=286.02s)]
*  The rationale was the reason to take the mugshot is in case the defendant flees, then you can [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=290.46s)]
*  find him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=294.62s)]
*  And everyone knows what Donald Trump looks like. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=295.62s)]
*  But on the other hand- [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  A fair and not ridiculous argument. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=298.53999999999996s)]
*  But on the other hand, as you said, everyone has their mugshot taken. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=300.5s)]
*  And why shouldn't he? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=304.3s)]
*  And why shouldn't Mr. Giuliani and all of the other defendants? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=305.82s)]
*  In Georgia, the sheriff made it clear at the beginning, unless someone tells me different, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=308.66s)]
*  everyone's going to get their mugshot taken. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  What do you think about it, Timothee? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=315.1s)]
*  I think one of the principles about all these cases is that no one is above the law and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=316.1s)]
*  that everyone, including a former president, should be treated the same in front of a court. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  And I think the mugshot is symbolic. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=325.98s)]
*  Yes, we all know how Donald Trump looks, but he should be subjected to the same scrutiny [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=328.82s)]
*  and regulations and everything else of every other everyday citizens. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=333.74s)]
*  And I think that's what it represents here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=337.12s)]
*  Same with the bop, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's the other thing that's interesting, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  Like they've negotiated $200,000. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=342.22s)]
*  All these folks are bonding out. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=343.7s)]
*  I mean, there's, you know, and this cash bail has been a subject of a tremendous policy [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=345.22s)]
*  controversy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=350.14s)]
*  I think it's largely, again, not a great practice. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=351.14s)]
*  I think it's been overused. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=352.74s)]
*  But in the, you know, watching Giuliani go to a bail bondsman, you know, you're a New [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=355.85999999999996s)]
*  Yorker. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=360.78s)]
*  I can't write to the folk. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=361.78s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=362.78s)]
*  Like there is something about that that, I don't know, it really hits. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=363.78s)]
*  And even the fact, and it's horrible, these conditions in that jail. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  They're terrible. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=370.58s)]
*  They're terrible. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=371.58s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=372.58s)]
*  There are thousands of people who are there now and who are going through it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=373.7s)]
*  And you know, now, hello America, this is what it looks like. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=378.58s)]
*  And because these are white collar defendants who usually don't have to see that, now they're [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=382.94s)]
*  seeing a little touch of that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=387.34s)]
*  Let's talk about this Cheesebro filing here, which is sort of interesting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=389.7s)]
*  I mean, so far, I think our general assumption has been everyone's going to want to kick [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=393.94s)]
*  the can. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=398.7s)]
*  They want to take it long. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=399.7s)]
*  They want to let Donald Trump get elected president. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=400.7s)]
*  Maybe he could work some magic, even though it's a Georgia state law. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=403.54s)]
*  It's being prosecuted under. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=407.02s)]
*  Cheesebro says, I want to be tried in December. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=408.86s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=410.62s)]
*  I think it's a choice here that he's testing the DA, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=412.26000000000005s)]
*  She's expecting Donald Trump wants to push this out as far as possible. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=416.86s)]
*  And he's saying, are you ready right now? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=420.42s)]
*  Can you go as fast as possible? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=422.86s)]
*  And I think what he's also trying to do is separate himself from President Trump. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=424.14000000000004s)]
*  The entire strength of the case is that there is a massive criminal conspiracy, former President [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=428.54s)]
*  Trump at the top and all his minions at the bottom. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=434.3s)]
*  Now he's saying, I want to go first. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=436.86s)]
*  Try me, perhaps even by myself. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=439.62s)]
*  Show the evidence of the story that has to do with just me. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=442.22s)]
*  Don't bring in evidence about Trump. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=445.58s)]
*  Don't try the President Trump case. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=447.58s)]
*  Try my case. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=449.94s)]
*  And I think if that works, it has a possibility of weakening the jury appeal because you don't [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=451.42s)]
*  get to tell the whole story from top to bottom. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=456.82s)]
*  You're telling his story, which is going to be a little bit more limited. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=459.82s)]
*  Well, and this gets to the idea of the 19 co-defendants and all being tried together, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  which funny will is at that press conference on the day that these charges were announced [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=466.18s)]
*  that she's going to do. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=469.46s)]
*  A lot of legal experts have said there's no way it's going to happen. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=470.46s)]
*  Where do you sit on that? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=473.46s)]
*  Well, also, I think he's going to sort of lose that calling the bluff because first [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=474.78s)]
*  of all, what he's giving up his defense attorney, he's not going to have motions. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=481.02s)]
*  Is he really saying I'm not going to move this press evidence? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=484.82s)]
*  Is he really saying I'm not going to spend months looking at the discovery to find inconsistent [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=487.78s)]
*  statements or possibly exculpatory material? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  You think it's a bluff? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=496.14s)]
*  I think it's a bluff. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=497.14s)]
*  And if she calls the bluff, well, then guess what? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=498.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=501.26s)]
*  And now you're on trial and you're like you're stuck with all the evidence that you didn't [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=502.26s)]
*  move this press. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=506.38s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=508.26s)]
*  It's not these prosecutors who spent two and a half years investigating it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  Their opening and their summations have already been written. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=513.98s)]
*  If not on paper, it's in their head. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=516.5s)]
*  And if he decides to suddenly say, oh, never mind, I'm not ready. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=519.18s)]
*  Well, that's the end of that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=522.5s)]
*  Then no judge will ever listen to him again when he says he wants a speedy trial. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=523.98s)]
*  What do you think about the plan? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=527.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, when you read through the 100 page indictment, one of the things that the document [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=529.98s)]
*  I think does well is it sort of conceives of it as a unified whole, even though there [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=536.02s)]
*  are many different aspects to the conspiracy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=541.66s)]
*  And in some cases, I think a lot of people weren't even in contact with each other. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=543.9s)]
*  That's the strength, as Timmy Dio said, of the conceit of this as a RICO case and of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=547.66s)]
*  the conceit of 19 defendants. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=552.9s)]
*  You tell the whole story at once. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=554.42s)]
*  What do you think about the possibility of that? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=555.62s)]
*  Well, you mean trying it alone or trying it all? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  Are they going to be able to try 19 defendants? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=560.4200000000001s)]
*  Everyone says that's not going to happen. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  What's going to happen, and I'm sure he's experienced this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=563.5s)]
*  I did. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  When you did conspiracy, people drop off because they plead guilty. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=566.74s)]
*  They cooperate. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=570.58s)]
*  So you end up not with 19 defendants. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=571.62s)]
*  Sometimes you'll end up with a firing squad where they're all shooting at each other, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=573.7s)]
*  a circular firing squad, because it's like, I only did this little piece. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=577.6600000000001s)]
*  Why am I stuck with Trump? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=582.94s)]
*  You know, I'm only the middle person. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=583.1400000000001s)]
*  You know, so there will not be 19 defendants on trial. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  That's a really important point. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=589.0200000000001s)]
*  It actually brings up the next thing I want to talk about, which is about cooperation, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  because to your point of we're not going to get to 19 because some people... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=594.74s)]
*  And when you look at the mugshot lineup that we have, these are people who are [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=598.5400000000001s)]
*  vastly vary in wealth, stature, public support, public notoriety, the degree to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=605.22s)]
*  which they can deal with, you know, can hire, you know, the best lawyers like, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=613.02s)]
*  and whose exposure varies quite a bit. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=617.3000000000001s)]
*  And you got to imagine they're going to start making some individual calculations. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lzWtw-dVkc&t=619.3000000000001s)]
