Video Description: Sen. Bernie Sanders implores voters who are discouraged by the Biden-Harris administration’s Gaza policies to support Harris over Trump: “What I think is it's important for people to know—especially young people—that as wrong as Biden and Harris are on this issue, Trump is even worse.”

# 'Trump is even worse' Bernie urges pro-Palestinian voters to back Harris
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU)
*  Just five days left to go, there's been an army of surrogates fanning out across the country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=0.0s)]
*  of both campaigns. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=4.32s)]
*  On the Kamala Harris side, it's represented this remarkably broad coalition of voters [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=5.74s)]
*  from progressives to business leaders to lifelong Republicans who are putting the Constitution [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=9.9s)]
*  and country over party, as Liz Cheney puts it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=14.44s)]
*  One of those surrogates who's been hitting the trail very hard is Senator Bernie Sanders [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=17.7s)]
*  of Vermont. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=21.12s)]
*  He helped kick off the Progressives for Harris Group's launch call in August after the switch [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=22.32s)]
*  put Harris at the top of the ticket. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=26.78s)]
*  In just the last few weeks alone, he's been campaigning across the country, Michigan, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=28.7s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, even down in Texas. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, joins me now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=35.18s)]
*  Senator, you've been out on the trail, you've spent decades talking to folks, talking to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=38.14s)]
*  voters, know what campaigns are like. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=42.82s)]
*  What's your general feeling about things right now? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=45.86s)]
*  Well, I wish I could give you some brilliant analysis, but I'm going to tell you what everybody [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=48.22s)]
*  else is saying. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  It's going to be a very, very close election. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=54.96s)]
*  It's going to come down to small numbers of votes and a handful of states. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=57.18s)]
*  But what I will tell you is going to Pennsylvania, going to Wisconsin just a few days ago, there's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=60.419999999999995s)]
*  a lot of energy on the ground. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=66.58s)]
*  I was especially delighted in Pennsylvania to see hundreds and hundreds of trade unionists [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=68.62s)]
*  coming out in Erie, Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=75.86s)]
*  They're going out, they're knocking on doors. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=79.78s)]
*  They know what this election is about and why Trump has got to be defeated and Kamala [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=81.54s)]
*  has got to be elected. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=87.62s)]
*  So a lot of energy on the ground, large meetings in Wisconsin college campuses, Madison, we're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=88.62s)]
*  making some progress. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=95.34s)]
*  Yeah, the point about trade unions is interesting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=96.34s)]
*  It sometimes feels like Elon Musk was like conjured from the mind of Bernie Sanders to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=100.66000000000001s)]
*  embody the billionaire class. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=107.5s)]
*  Like with his, you know, using essentially Citizens United to spend hundreds of millions [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=109.82s)]
*  of dollars, the record that he's had virulently anti-union in the actual businesses he runs, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=113.8s)]
*  particularly Tesla, the promises he's making. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=119.94s)]
*  It seems to me, I wonder how much that's penetrating, but it does seem to me like if you have any [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=122.8s)]
*  question about which side the Trump campaign's on, Musk's presence is a pretty good indicator. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=127.42s)]
*  Well, Chris, you're absolutely right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=132.78s)]
*  And one of the things that has bothered me is we have not talked enough about in this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=135.62s)]
*  campaign, the unbelievable amount of money that billionaires are spending. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=139.9s)]
*  You know, in Trump's campaign, you got three billionaires who are spending combined hundreds [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=145.3s)]
*  of millions of dollars to elect Donald Trump as president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=151.18s)]
*  Democrats have their billionaires. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=156.62s)]
*  But what we have got to deal with is the reality that we cannot allow this type of billionaire [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=158.3s)]
*  money to determine who the next president of the United States is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=164.7s)]
*  And the word has got to go out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=168.26s)]
*  Citizens United has got to go, in my view, public funding of elections. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=170.14s)]
*  You know, one of those other billionaires, Miriam Adelson, who's the widow of the late [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=174.26s)]
*  Sheldon Adelson, also given, I think, about 100 million in super PAC last, she's someone [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=177.94s)]
*  who cares very deeply about American policy towards Israel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=184.92s)]
*  She is very supportive of the right-wing Likud government in Netanyahu and the possible annexation [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=189.2s)]
*  in Toto of the West Bank and right-wing Israeli politics. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=193.84s)]
*  She's given Trump 100 million and clearly thinks she's going to get something from it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=198.48s)]
*  I think it's fair and rational to say. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=202.84s)]
*  You put out a video the other day sort of addressing people in the Democratic coalition [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=206.0s)]
*  who are frustrated or upset at the Biden-Harris administration towards Israel regarding the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=209.2s)]
*  Gaza war and explaining why you think it's so important to vote for Harris. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=215.36s)]
*  Give me the version of that talk, particularly given the context that I think Miriam Adelson [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=221.06s)]
*  has probably got a good read on what you're going to get from a Trump presidency. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=225.9s)]
*  Well, look, the bottom line is there are many, many millions of Americans, including myself, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=230.06s)]
*  who strongly disagree with Biden's and Harris's position on Gaza and their support of Netanyahu. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=238.74s)]
*  I don't have to go into a great list. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=245.62s)]
*  Now, I think viewers understand that what's going on in Gaza now is horrific. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  It determines the loss of life, the number of people injured. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=251.38s)]
*  And now, because Israel is blocking humanitarian aid, we're looking at mass malnutrition of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  children and starvation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=260.5s)]
*  And they're going to make it even worse by not allowing UNWA to provide humanitarian [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=262.94s)]
*  aid in Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  What I think is it's important for people to know, especially young people, that as [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=270.02s)]
*  wrong as Biden and Harris are on this issue, Trump is even worse. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=276.68s)]
*  He is being supported by Mrs. Adelson, huge amounts of money, and she is rapidly pro-Netanyahu. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  We cannot even—this is really quite incredible, quite embarrassing—is that at a time when [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  children are starving in Gaza, we could not get Republicans to even support humanitarian [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=297.78s)]
*  aid, feed hungry children. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  So the point of my video, which kind of blew me away, it's gotten over 15 million views [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=308.26s)]
*  right by now, is that, yeah, we disagree with Harris on this issue, but we have a much better [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=313.61999999999995s)]
*  chance, and I promise I will do everything that I can to move the administration to change [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=321.74s)]
*  their policies and not continue to provide financial aid or military aid or offensive [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=327.74s)]
*  aid to Netanyahu. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=333.74s)]
*  But we have a much better chance of changing U.S. policy under Harris than certainly under [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=335.3s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=342.06s)]
*  You know, I've been thinking about a reference that I think you'll appreciate. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=343.06s)]
*  I was not there for, but you know, the 68 campaign, people were very, very understandably [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=346.98s)]
*  and rightly enraged at Johnson and the Democratic Party over Vietnam. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=351.62s)]
*  And Nixon, people forget this, but Nixon basically ran as the peace candidate in 68 and then [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=357.1s)]
*  immediately started bombing Cambodia in secret and caused the loss of life. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, that 68 weighs heavily because, believe me, it could get worse if the wrong person [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=366.38s)]
*  is elected president. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=372.70000000000005s)]
*  And I think about that all the time. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=373.94s)]
*  Well, I think that's a good point. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=377.42s)]
*  And let's understand that Netanyahu, who is a right-wing racist extremist, prime minister [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=379.42s)]
*  in Israel, surely wants his good friend Donald Trump to be president of the United States, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=386.3s)]
*  two right-wing extremists working together. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=392.82s)]
*  So I think on this issue, again, even on this issue, Harris is going to be far superior [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=395.98s)]
*  to Trump. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  And we have a chance, if millions of us get active on this issue, to change U.S. policy [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders has been crisscrossing country, talking to trade unionists and folks [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  at college campuses, and put that video out in 50 million views. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=416.3s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=419.62s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=420.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt9ra8B1DU&t=425.98s)]
