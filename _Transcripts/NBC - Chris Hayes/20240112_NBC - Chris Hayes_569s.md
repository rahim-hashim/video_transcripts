# ‘Terror as a tactic’: Threat of MAGA mob looms over 2024 Republican primary
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It is here. Well, almost here. On [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Monday, Republicans will cast their ballots in the Iowa caucuses. It will be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=4.32s)]
*  the first time since the January 6th insurrection the voters will see Donald [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=8.72s)]
*  Trump's name on the ballot and a whole lot of those voters are going to support [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=13.8s)]
*  him. They're going to say, yeah, yep, we want the guy that tried to steal the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=17.36s)]
*  last election and is now facing years in prison for doing it. It's already been a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=22.04s)]
*  very weird campaign for a lot of reasons. I mean, we started with a huge field of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=26.8s)]
*  candidates, remember that? And most of them have either dropped out or just [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=31.6s)]
*  faded into the background before the votes are cast. Like, they got wintered [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=34.6s)]
*  out fast. And when they are cast in three days, voters will be breathing snow and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=37.56s)]
*  sub-zero temperatures in what is expected to be the coldest caucuses ever, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=42.84s)]
*  which is saying something because there's been a lot of cold caucuses. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=47.68s)]
*  Despite the cold, leading challengers Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=50.28s)]
*  dutifully trudging across the state trying to drum up support. They will most [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=54.9s)]
*  likely still lose if polling is any indication that we don't know. They [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=59.7s)]
*  could lose by historic margin to a frontrunner who, let's be clear, has spent [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=63.22s)]
*  more time in court attending his civil fraud trial this week than he has in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=67.98s)]
*  state of Iowa. And even if now it feels inevitable that we would come to this, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=73.5s)]
*  it was not inevitable. It really wasn't. There was a time in winter 2021, after [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=78.66s)]
*  January 6, when Donald Trump was being impeached for inciting the Capitol [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=86.82s)]
*  insurrection, his approval rating hit an all-time low. It looked like he could [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=90.06s)]
*  very well be sent into a sort of permanent political exile. And then he [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=93.3s)]
*  sort of came back. And then the 2022 midterms, the elections worked out [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=97.94s)]
*  poorly for most Trump endorsed candidates. He backed losers in a ton of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=101.74s)]
*  winnable races. And there seemed to be a dawning awareness in the Republican [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  Party that he was politically toxic. And 2024 could be a wide open race for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=109.3s)]
*  Republicans. All those folks got in because they thought he was beatable. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  Not now. Now Trump is polling at 54 percent, more than 30 points ahead of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=116.66s)]
*  Haley, his closest challenger. It is not even close enough to say it's not even [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=121.13999999999999s)]
*  close. Of course, the only poll that matters is the one on election day, as we [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  like to say here. But there's already a lot of discussion about sort of how we [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=129.22s)]
*  got here, right, on the on the threshold of this moment. And there's a lot of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=132.94s)]
*  factors that have brought us to this point in which Trump is, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=137.02s)]
*  leading by 30 or 40 points. There is the terrible, I mean, truly almost [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  historically terrible campaign of Ron DeSantis, who once looked like a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=144.7s)]
*  formidable challenger. There's the growing desire in the Republican [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  electorate for authoritarian politics. And that's fueled by this ever sort of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=152.46s)]
*  radicalizing conservative media industry. There is, of course, the complete [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=158.18s)]
*  personal cowardice of Republican leaders who could have voted to convict [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=162.86s)]
*  Trump during impeachment. We wouldn't have this problem, but who've also run [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=166.18s)]
*  interference for Trump all along. So all of those factors are here. But there is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=169.3s)]
*  one factor on the eve of this first contest. There's one factor I think does [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=172.34s)]
*  not get enough play, and that's the tools of mob menace, the coercion, the threats [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=178.62s)]
*  of violence the Trump and MAGA movements employ that are constantly shaping the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=184.34s)]
*  space in which the race is itself contested. I talked yesterday about this, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=189.02s)]
*  about the bomb threat at the home of the judge in Trump's civil trial and how it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=194.46s)]
*  was not an isolated incident. It wasn't just business as usual. From the MAGA [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=199.06s)]
*  bomber to the Cincinnati FBI shooter, remember that guy that showed up at the FBI [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  after the indictments, the death threats, the fake emergency calls against [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=207.46s)]
*  investigators and prosecutors, just a few in the past week, judges, election [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=210.86s)]
*  officials. There has just been a constant stream of threats of violence and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  actual attempts at violence against people that have tried to hold Donald [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=218.7s)]
*  Trump to account. The intimidation hangs over all of his endeavors, is a big part [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=221.82s)]
*  of his strength. But the place where this kind of politics is the most effective, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  the most acutely present, is within Republican Party circles. Because for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=233.22s)]
*  people who exist in that world, inside the Republican Party, inside professional [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  conservative politics, the harassment and threat of violence is much, much more [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  intimate. There were members who told me that they were afraid for their own [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  security, afraid, you know, in some instances for their lives. Colleagues who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  are now traveling with armed escorts out of the fear for their safety. Many of us [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  are altering our routines, working to get body armor. Our expectation is that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=259.02s)]
*  someone may try to kill us. The threats are constant. They've increased. Um, you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=264.5s)]
*  know, I even heard a voicemail just this morning that we got last night [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=269.46s)]
*  threatening execution. That's kind of seems to be the normal thing nowadays [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=272.82s)]
*  was just threatened execution. Again, that all happened not not long time ago. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=277.82s)]
*  It's regrettably easy to forget now that Republicans who voted to impeach or [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=283.82s)]
*  convict Trump were, they thought at least, and I think credibly kind of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=287.02s)]
*  putting their lives at risk, at least their family safety and themselves, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  certainly their peace of mind was put at risk. I mean, do you remember this? We [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=295.78s)]
*  just learned this a few months ago. Senator Mitt Romney revealed that he had [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=299.94s)]
*  to spend $5000 a day on protective security after January 6th. In fact, as [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=302.74s)]
*  he later revealed to Atlantic reporter, McKay Coppins in a biography of Romney, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=308.66s)]
*  a reckoning, one Republican congressman confided to Romney he wanted to vote [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=312.22s)]
*  for Trump's second impeachment but chose not to out of fear for his family [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=316.62s)]
*  safety. And when one senator, a member of leadership, said he was leaning [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=320.18s)]
*  towards voting to convict, the others urged him to reconsider. You can't do [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=324.22s)]
*  that, Romney recalled someone saying. Think of your personal safety, said [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=327.7s)]
*  another. Think of your children. The senator eventually decided they were [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=330.78s)]
*  right. And this extends past people that are at the upper echelons of political [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=334.5s)]
*  power, past politicians or public officials, more than just they have been [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=340.98s)]
*  subjected to this mob intimidation. I mean, election officials and even like [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=345.26s)]
*  writers, just people with opinions, conservative writer and Trump critic [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  David French has recounted how they went after him. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=352.5s)]
*  An individual calls and said, I'm sorry, but I've been asked by the Trump [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=356.78s)]
*  campaign to make sure that, you know, David knows that this will be really, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=360.9s)]
*  really bad for him. The assaults on my family have been overwhelming just as a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=364.97999999999996s)]
*  writer. I have a multiracial family, and so they have gone after my youngest [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=369.58s)]
*  daughter in the worst way imaginable. That was back in 2016. Today, French, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=373.82s)]
*  who's still conservative, strongly staunchly conservative and also strongly [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=379.18s)]
*  staunchly anti-Trump, wrote in the New York Times that things are even worse. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=382.46s)]
*  Quote, eight years of bitter experience have taught us that supporting Trump [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=386.06s)]
*  degrades the character of his core supporters. Never before have I seen [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=389.74s)]
*  extremism penetrate a vast American community so deeply, so completely and so [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=393.86s)]
*  comprehensively. And I'm going to tell you, this is all stuff that's sort of on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=398.7s)]
*  the record and documented. For every example of this, there is stuff not on [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  the record that people discuss about their security situation, which they [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=406.54s)]
*  can't talk about publicly for obvious reasons, that any time they're in the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=410.62s)]
*  crosshairs, they're dealing with a security issue, cautious of Trump. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=414.14000000000004s)]
*  And that's particularly true for people whose life is Republican Party politics, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=419.26000000000005s)]
*  whose constituents are conservatives and neighbors who are Trump devotees. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=422.3s)]
*  This extremism, this acceptance of coercion, of political violence or the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=426.22s)]
*  threat thereof, of terror, of just insane harassment as a tactic, it's really [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=431.82s)]
*  powerful. I think it's fair to say, I really believe this, that it has [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=439.26s)]
*  completely subverted the ability of the Republican Party themselves to genuinely [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=445.06s)]
*  run a free and fair election within their own party to choose their own [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=450.9s)]
*  nominee. Because not only is there this ever present threat, you know, everyone [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=453.62s)]
*  in the upper echelons of the party also understands that Donald Trump will never [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=458.82s)]
*  accept defeat. I mean, you're having a contest with a guy who, is he going to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=463.46s)]
*  accept defeat? They understand it because of January 6th, but they understand it [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=467.3s)]
*  before that. They understand it because of 2016, when Trump lost the Iowa [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=471.22s)]
*  caucuses and he reportedly pressured state Republicans to invalidate the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  results. Does that sound familiar? He ran around afterwards saying it was rigged. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  So just take a second to imagine what it would look like if Nikki Haley or someone [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=485.66s)]
*  else actually were to start beating Donald Trump for the nomination this year. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=490.06s)]
*  If we started seeing some surprises, right? And that has happened before in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=492.7s)]
*  American politics. It's just almost impossible not to imagine a situation in [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=496.42s)]
*  which you end up with a scene that looks like January 6th outside the Republican [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=504.5s)]
*  National Convention. Right? Like, if Trump starts losing, what's going to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=510.22s)]
*  happen? Play that out. They all have. They all understand what they're dealing [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=516.22s)]
*  with. It is under those conditions. Those are the conditions under which we are [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=519.94s)]
*  having this contest, this election for the Republican nominee. Whatever happens [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=524.14s)]
*  on Monday in Iowa and later in New Hampshire and South Carolina and Super [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRUHm_DPTXQ&t=529.26s)]
