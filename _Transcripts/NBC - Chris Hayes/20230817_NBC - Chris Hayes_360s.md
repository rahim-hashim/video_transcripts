Video Description: What injury does a doctor have if their patient takes the abortion pill? According to a right-wing judge, pictures of fetuses are "a source of profound joy,” therefore doctors “experience an aesthetic injury when they are aborted.” “Pretty deranged,” says Chris Hayes.

# ‘Bonkers’ MAGA judge says abortion pill robs doctors ‘joy’ of fetus pictures
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo)
*  I'm going to show you a picture and some of the people in it you will recognize and some [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=0.0s)]
*  you will not. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=5.0s)]
*  So right there in the center of this picture, that's Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=6.0s)]
*  You probably recognize him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=10.84s)]
*  Over there on the left is podcaster and Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=13.6s)]
*  You probably recognize him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=18.0s)]
*  And if you're thinking, wow, that looks like a really nice room, you're right. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=19.0s)]
*  That's the library that belongs to billionaire Harlan Crow. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=23.84s)]
*  Crow of course is the guy who paid the private boarding school tuition for Clarence Thomas's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=28.0s)]
*  grand nephew. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=32.1s)]
*  Also, the guy who bought the house where Thomas's mother lives, rent free. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=33.1s)]
*  He's the guy that's taken Thomas on all sorts of incredibly luxurious trips. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  And his library was used for the occasion to swear in this guy, someone you probably [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=42.94s)]
*  don't know. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=47.04s)]
*  His name is James Ho and he is being sworn into the federal judiciary by Justice Clarence [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=48.56s)]
*  Thomas in 2018 after being nominated by Donald Trump. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=53.96s)]
*  Ho is a right wing lawyer, Federalist Society made man, if you will, who got a lifetime [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  judicial appointment to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=62.36s)]
*  And he's in the news now because of, well, just excruciating opinion that he wrote about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=66.36s)]
*  the abortion pill, methampristone. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=71.48s)]
*  So it started yesterday. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=73.92s)]
*  That's when that Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is probably the most right wing appellate [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=75.48s)]
*  court in the country, upheld parts of an opinion by another right wing judge in Texas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=79.3s)]
*  Remember the guy in Amarillo who tried to single handedly take the abortion pill off [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=84.89999999999999s)]
*  all shelves nationwide, everywhere through judicial fiat. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=90.78s)]
*  Now this case that has been working its way through the federal judiciary, one of the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=96.14s)]
*  challenges for this lawsuit is that the plaintiffs who are suing, right, to get the drug taken [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=100.46s)]
*  off the shelves, there are a bunch of anti-abortion doctors basically. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  And for them to have standing in federal court, right, to even get to an analysis of the merits [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  of the case, they got to show that they have an injury. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=116.48s)]
*  Like, what is the injury? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=119.48s)]
*  What injury does a doctor have if a patient somewhere takes this abortion pill or if the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=121.68s)]
*  abortion pill is accessible broadly? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=128.02s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=129.88s)]
*  In an opinion written by Judge James Ho, that guy who's in the Harlan Crow Library with [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=132.68s)]
*  Clarence Thomas and Ted Cruz, that guy took a really bonkers position writing in his opinion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  that the plaintiffs, these are the anti-abortion doctors, experience aesthetic injury. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=147.5s)]
*  That's the grounds for standing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm not making this up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  I didn't pull this out of the room. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to quote it here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  Quote, unborn babies, you know what his politics are from that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  Unborn babies, what we call fetuses, are a source of profound joy for those who view [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=161.96s)]
*  them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=166.84s)]
*  Expectant parents eagerly share ultrasound photos with loved ones. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=167.84s)]
*  Doctors delight in working with their unborn patients and experience an aesthetic injury [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=172.72s)]
*  when they are aborted. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=178.88s)]
*  Yeah, again, I did not make this up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=180.88s)]
*  This is an actual judicial opinion published. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  He wrote that down, put it out in the world. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=189.24s)]
*  As a legal matter, according to this judge, James Ho, every doctor has a legally cognizable [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=191.54s)]
*  interest in people making babies for them to look at as a matter of law. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  They suffer a legally actionable injury if you don't give them that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  Your womb is there to make baby pictures and babies and fetuses for them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=213.9s)]
*  Pretty deranged. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, ultimately, the other two hard right judges on that three judge panel didn't agree [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=225.78s)]
*  with that part of James Ho's decision, the most outrageous contention. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=232.5s)]
*  Ho was writing sort of part dissent, part concurrence. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=236.82s)]
*  The three judge panel, these three right wing judges, they did buy a huge part of this anti-abortion [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=239.9s)]
*  lawsuit, this facially preposterous lawsuit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  They issued an opinion to massively roll back access to methamphetrysone back to the way [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=250.34s)]
*  it was in 2016, seven years ago, before the FDA, that's the agency that actually makes [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=255.46s)]
*  decisions about this stuff and has some extra tease on it, made the abortion pill easier [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=260.44s)]
*  to obtain. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=264.68s)]
*  Yeah, nothing changes for now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  The effects are stayed because it's going to go up to the Supreme Court. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=268.66s)]
*  But again, what do you think the 6-3 Trump Court's going to do with methamphetrysone? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=271.86s)]
*  What do you think they're going to say? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=277.5s)]
*  Think they're going to kick it on standing grounds? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=278.5s)]
*  Are they going to find some standing for these anti-abortion doctors who incorporated right [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=280.5s)]
*  after Dobbs and filed this in Amarillo where they knew they had another right wing judge [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=284.22s)]
*  and then it got kicked up to an appellate court full of other right wing judges who [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=288.38s)]
*  think that there's an aesthetic injury if you use methamphetrysone because you're robbing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  the OBGYN of the joy of looking at your fetus. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=295.58s)]
*  The thing to recognize is that none of these people or the circles of power they're enmeshed [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=302.02s)]
*  in, James Ho, Clarence Thomas, Ted Cruz, Harlan Crowe, the Federalist Society, Donald Trump, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  the Republican Party, none of them will stop until every abortion is banned everywhere [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  in this country in any form, surgical or medical. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=319.62s)]
*  They're not going to stop unless they are completely and totally politically defeated, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=323.14s)]
*  not once, not twice, but over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=328.14s)]
*  That is the only way to stop them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=334.3s)]
*  We're going to talk about that next. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pOH3KVMLbo&t=336.02s)]
