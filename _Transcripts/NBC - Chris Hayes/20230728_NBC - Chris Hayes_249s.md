# 'Are you ok?!': Psaki puzzled by DeSantis’ 'bizarre' campaign amid spiral
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ)
*  So lately as I have been watching the way Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=0.0s)]
*  running his presidential campaign, there is a question that has been running [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  through my mind. Are you okay governor? I mean for real. Are you good? It's okay if [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=8.64s)]
*  you don't actually want to run for president. It's completely okay. It's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=14.32s)]
*  difficult really to take away any other conclusion when you look at the events [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=18.48s)]
*  of the last few weeks from the Florida governor's increasingly bizarre campaign [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=22.68s)]
*  for the White House. Take his recent fundraising report. It turns out until [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=27.12s)]
*  recently at least he was burning through money like a teen pop star with a new [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=31.04s)]
*  record deal. For anyone who doesn't follow that, it's quite quickly. But this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=34.96s)]
*  whole spending issue was apparently news to Ron DeSantis. This detail from some [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=38.88s)]
*  of the reporting earlier this week really stuck out to me. Quote, that the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  campaign did not hit expected fundraising targets and spent exorbitantly caught [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=47.36s)]
*  the candidate and his wife by surprise. A person with knowledge of the reaction [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=51.44s)]
*  set. Now here's the thing. DeSantis and his wife have been criss-crossing the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=55.52s)]
*  country on a private plane, private jets, spending worth more than a million [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  dollars on air travel. I mean did they walk onto that plane and think those [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=63.72s)]
*  jets were free or something? Don't they know free private jet rides are only [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=67.44s)]
*  available to conservative Supreme Court justices with rich benefactors? Sorry I [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=71.28s)]
*  couldn't help myself on that one. And it is not just the fundraising either. It's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=75.08s)]
*  it's hard to imagine that DeSantis' defense of some policy it's had the goal [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=78.92s)]
*  of actually winning votes in mind. This week he defended a decision by the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=83.68s)]
*  Florida Department of Education to include language in the state curriculum [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=87.92s)]
*  effectively defending slavery and touting the supposed benefits of it to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=92.04s)]
*  people who were enslaved. I mean it was so beyond the pale. Even the standards of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  conservative culture wars didn't buy it, didn't buy into it. It sparked one of the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  first attacks this primary cycle from the friendly and mild-mannered Republican [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=107.28s)]
*  candidate Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina who criticized the governor's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=112.08s)]
*  comments by pointing out there is no silver lining in slavery. Fact check [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=115.84s)]
*  that one's very very true by Senator Tim Scott. Side note this one's for you Tim [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=120.2s)]
*  Scott. We know you have it in you now. We know you are not just nice. Don't stop [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=125.0s)]
*  with DeSantis. Some free political advice for you. Google Trump crimes mob. It's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=130.28s)]
*  gonna blow your mind. And I might give you some ideas. We'll see. We'll see what you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=135.8s)]
*  do over the next few weeks. Now this week DeSantis also somehow managed to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=139.2s)]
*  hit the double whammy angering two different political constituencies at [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=143.2s)]
*  the same time. Republicans who are anti conspiracy theorists and Republicans [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  who are anti Democrat. When he floated a position in his administration for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=152.64s)]
*  Democratic presidential candidate and noted anti-vaxxer RFK jr. He even just [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=157.2s)]
*  tried to walk it back since then. But it was so ridiculous that Mike Pence took a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  swing. Mike Pence. Well we are handing out political advice though. Side note [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=166.76s)]
*  for you Mike Pence. We know you have it in you too. Deep down in there somewhere. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=171.2s)]
*  Your homework is to Google January 6th and hang Mike Pence. Wasn't great? It [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=175.0s)]
*  feels like you of all people have the right to point that out more frequently [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  out there on the campaign trail and the role Donald Trump had and all that. So [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=184.28s)]
*  DeSantis is floundering in the polls burning through cash defending the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  of slavery floating jobs for conspiracy theorists Democrats. It's enough to make [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  you wonder if this whole campaign is really a cry for help. Does he really [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  want to do it? Just know that you can always take solace in the knowledge that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  you still have the political X factor that unteachable gift for retail [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  politics that could make up for all of it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  Oh what is that? I see. Yeah that's probably a lot of sugar. Good to see you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=212.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=218.84s)]
*  We'll have much more on DeSantis and the rest of the Republican field with two [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=222.84s)]
*  party insiders just ahead. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlIcb2m3KQ&t=226.48000000000002s)]
