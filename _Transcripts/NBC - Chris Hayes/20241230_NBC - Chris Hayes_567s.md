# Stacey Abrams honors Jimmy Carter: He ‘remade Democratic politics’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4)
*  President Jimmy Carter spent his entire long life in service of one form or the other to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=0.0s)]
*  others in the military as governor of Georgia, as president, and then of course in his decades [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=4.4s)]
*  of work around the globe after he left the White House. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=8.96s)]
*  He inspired a generation of advocates and politicians, including fellow Georgian Stacey [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=12.0s)]
*  Averams. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=16.2s)]
*  President Carter was a vocal supporter of Averams' work on voting rights, and he campaigned [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=17.2s)]
*  with her in her race for governor of Georgia in 2018. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=21.52s)]
*  And Stacey Averams joins me now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=25.44s)]
*  It's great to have you on the program. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  I would love to hear what your relationship was like with Jimmy Carter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=29.24s)]
*  Obviously, the Carter family, I know, looms enormously large in Georgia democratic politics. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=33.48s)]
*  I would say it looms large in Georgia politics because part of the legacy of Jimmy Carter [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=40.36s)]
*  was his commitment to rural Georgia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  And that's how I got to know him first. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=48.56s)]
*  I actually met him when I spoke at the Boys and Girls Club of Americas, Georgia, or Southwest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=50.0s)]
*  Georgia in Americas, which is his hometown. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=57.64s)]
*  And he was there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=61.2s)]
*  He was there at a Boys and Girls Club banquet because it was so important to him that young [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=63.2s)]
*  people had belief that there was a better future ahead. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=68.04s)]
*  The images of me with President Carter and Mrs. Carter were from the opening of a medical [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=72.12s)]
*  center because Georgia has refused to expand Medicaid under Republican leadership. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=77.6s)]
*  And he answered the call by opening his own clinic to ensure that the rural communities [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=82.0s)]
*  had access to health care. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=87.2s)]
*  If you saw a problem that was political in nature, Jimmy Carter was going to try to solve [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=89.4s)]
*  it through humanitarian efforts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  But he never shied away from the political reality that power was there to be used to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=97.08s)]
*  make people's lives better. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=102.04s)]
*  And he was essentially committed to doing that no matter what the platform or the title. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=104.2s)]
*  One of the things that any democratic politician in, well, any democratic politician anywhere, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  any politician, but particularly in the South and particularly in the South in the 1970s, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=117.0s)]
*  like Jimmy Carter had to negotiate, were controversies around race, particularly when he's running [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=120.92s)]
*  for governor the first time, very intense and active live debate about desegregation, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=125.84s)]
*  segregation, the like. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=131.12s)]
*  His record there was really interesting. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=133.36s)]
*  I mean, there were times where he sort of ran to the right on those issues, times where [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=134.36s)]
*  he ran to the left. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=137.68s)]
*  And I'm curious how you think about that legacy when you sort of look in context of the complicated [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=139.2s)]
*  journey of a white politician in the South, like Georgia, at that period of time. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=145.44s)]
*  I think you're right to use the term complicated. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=152.96s)]
*  But I also think about evolution. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=155.68s)]
*  There are those who not only began in the wrong place, they've lived there, they've [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=157.76s)]
*  built housing there, they have committed themselves to remaining mired in prejudice and discrimination, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=162.12s)]
*  justifying their bigotry by claiming that it's necessary. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=169.2s)]
*  Jimmy Carter looked for ways to be better, and he confronted his mistakes by doing things [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=173.56s)]
*  about it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=179.44s)]
*  And so, despite the behaviors that may raise some eyebrows, this is the same man who appointed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=180.44s)]
*  Ambassador Andy Young and told him, go and meet every leader you can on the continent [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=186.28s)]
*  of Africa, because we have ignored this place for too long. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  He is the person who used his power, both in the White House and then afterwards, to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=196.4s)]
*  lift up communities, especially communities of color, to provide access to service, and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=202.0s)]
*  who has made, who made as part of his central legacy, fighting for voting rights. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=207.28s)]
*  That was something that disproportionately affected black and brown people, especially [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=213.0s)]
*  black people in Georgia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=216.6s)]
*  And he did the work. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=218.56s)]
*  He didn't just talk about it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=219.88s)]
*  He showed up, he spoke up, he challenged power. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=221.48s)]
*  And that evolution, I think, speaks volumes about the character and the core of the man. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=225.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, one of the most fascinating sort of parts of his biography was his 1970 run for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=229.68s)]
*  governor, which was successful, in which he, you know, arguably ran to the right of primary [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=236.24s)]
*  opponent on these issues. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=241.84s)]
*  And then when he won, he has his inauguration, he says this, quite famously, I think surprising, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=243.24s)]
*  a certain number of people who had voted for the man, he says that the time for racial [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=249.96s)]
*  discrimination is over. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=254.44s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=255.8s)]
*  I say to you quite frankly, that the time for racial discrimination is over. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=257.64s)]
*  The muted applause there is a thunderclap in Georgia politics. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=270.56s)]
*  How do you think about the through line from Carter, who obviously wins his home state [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=275.24s)]
*  when he runs for office? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=281.04s)]
*  Bill Clinton wins it, I believe, in 96 in re-elect. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=283.92s)]
*  He doesn't win in 92, but he wins it in 96. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=286.8s)]
*  Biden wins it in 2020. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=289.28s)]
*  All the other years it's been Republican. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=290.92s)]
*  About the sort of trajectory of your state and Democratic politics there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=292.64s)]
*  Well, actually, Clinton won in 92 because I got to work on that campaign. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=298.32s)]
*  Oh, he did win in 92. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  Right, yeah, sorry. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for the correction. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  No, I think that what we saw in Jimmy Carter, what we saw with Bill Clinton, what we saw [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  with Joe Biden and what we almost achieved with Kamala Harris is, again, the evolution [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=313.72s)]
*  of a state that is becoming more and more recognizable as a bellwether of how our political [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=320.8s)]
*  futures will be shaped by who we give primacy to, who we give humanity to, who we give opportunity [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=329.12s)]
*  to. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=335.52s)]
*  And the people who win Georgia and serve Georgia best are the ones who see all of our state [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  and all of the people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=343.2s)]
*  I am, of course, deeply disappointed about the outcome in 2024. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=344.68s)]
*  But what I hope we take from the passing of Jimmy Carter is the innovation that he brought [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=350.08s)]
*  to politics. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=355.52s)]
*  When he won the presidency in 1976, he did something no one had ever done. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  This governor from Georgia took himself to Iowa and essentially remade Democratic politics. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=361.48s)]
*  We have to remake how we think about our future. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=367.82s)]
*  We have to do it by understanding the complexity of where we are, but by having a vision for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=370.72s)]
*  what is to come. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think more than anything, what Jimmy Carter tells us about the politics of the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  South is that we are constantly learning. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=381.48s)]
*  We have absolutely every opportunity with each election to pick something new, to be [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=384.12s)]
*  braver than we were the time before. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=388.76000000000005s)]
*  And I'm just honored to have spent time in his orbit and to live in a state that he believed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=391.36s)]
*  in so deeply that he never left. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to present with you a certain view of the lessons of both Jimmy Carter and the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=400.2s)]
*  recent election of Donald Trump that I think is a tempting one for certain people. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=405.92s)]
*  I think people articulate it and I want to hear what you think of it, which is basically [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=410.12s)]
*  that essentially decency is for losers, that if you kind of appeal to people's better angels [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=413.86s)]
*  or you like calling them for things like self-sacrifices, as Carter famously did in that speech about [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=421.08s)]
*  the sweater, that American people don't like that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=426.76s)]
*  What they want is they want to find someone to blame, that demagoguery and sort of those [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=430.32s)]
*  politics are very effective. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=435.62s)]
*  And you know, maybe their Democrats have to find their own version of that, essentially, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=438.28s)]
*  because what gets people going in politics is like who they're angry at. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=441.84s)]
*  And I'm curious what you think about them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=445.52s)]
*  I think decency is a choice. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=448.88s)]
*  It's a difficult choice, but one that when viewed authentically has this effect of boosting [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=451.32s)]
*  confidence and boosting morale. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=458.36s)]
*  It cannot be by itself the only offering. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=461.0s)]
*  And I think what we saw, unfortunately, with President Carter was that when decency confronts [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=464.8s)]
*  ignominy, ignominy has a leg up because ignominy is willing to do things that decency won't. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=470.44s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you abandon decency. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=476.8s)]
*  I think it means you find other allies. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=478.88s)]
*  You do more. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  You accumulate more who want what decency can offer. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  And sometimes I think the challenge for Democrats is that we think that if we abandon decency, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=486.23999999999995s)]
*  we can get what ignominy has. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=491.08s)]
*  I would argue that if we expand the ambit of decency, that's how you bring more people [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMBhjJ7z4B4&t=493.24s)]
