# UAW chief Tesla's Elon Musk gets rich ‘on the backs of working class people’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs)
*  This week, the United Auto Workers announced that its members at each of the big three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. automakers had officially ratified their newly negotiated contract. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  According to the union, 64 percent of workers across Ford, Atlantis, and General Motors [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=8.96s)]
*  voted in favor of the deal won by the union after a six-week strike. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=13.94s)]
*  And in an enduring lesson about the power of labor unions, the new contract brought [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=19.12s)]
*  gains beyond UAW membership. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=23.26s)]
*  At least half a dozen non-union automakers, Hyundai, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=25.96s)]
*  Volkswagen, all announced they would raise the pay of their U.S. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=31.28s)]
*  auto workers most roughly in line with the UAW contract. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=34.6s)]
*  This cements the longest auto worker strike in 25 years as not only a huge success for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=38.6s)]
*  the UAW, but a success for all auto workers across the industry and a reminder of the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=43.08s)]
*  impact a unionized workforce can have on the distribution between wages and profits. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=48.56s)]
*  I'm going to now for an exclusive interview with the man who led the union in that strike, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=54.32s)]
*  Sean Fain, President, United Auto Workers of America. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=58.5s)]
*  Congratulations on this very successful undertaking. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=62.12s)]
*  How stressed out were you about how long this might go? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=67.64s)]
*  Hey, Chris. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=73.0s)]
*  Thanks for having us, and it's an honor to be here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=74.92s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I really wasn't stressed out about how long it takes because we knew [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  we had the power of the membership behind us, and we had a membership because of our [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=80.72s)]
*  contract campaign and things we've done differently since we took over. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=84.26s)]
*  Our membership was energized and ready to do whatever they had to do to get the right [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=88.5s)]
*  results. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=92.04s)]
*  So it was just really a matter of the strategy and how we were going to exercise that and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=93.04s)]
*  just fully use the power of the membership. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=97.9s)]
*  And that's what gave us power at the bargaining table. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=99.8s)]
*  Obviously, United Auto Workers, Democratic Union, you're elected by them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=101.92s)]
*  You serve as their representative in these contract negotiations, not at the places that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=105.2s)]
*  aren't unionized. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  But I'm curious to hear your reaction to this kind of sort of spillover effect that we've [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  seen at non-union automakers raising their wages as well. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=115.64s)]
*  Hey, we call that the UAW bump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=121.08s)]
*  That's what happens when we bargain good contracts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=123.56s)]
*  Bargaining and organizing go hand in hand. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  And it's not a coincidence that within three days after us coming to tentative agreements [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=128.88s)]
*  at the Big Three, Toyota raised their wages by 11 percent and reduced their progression [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=133.32s)]
*  to four years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=137.84s)]
*  Then Honda followed suit with bigger raises and a three-year progression. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Then Hyundai jumped on board. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Now Volkswagen's jumped on board. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=145.4s)]
*  And just today, Subaru announced wage increases for their employees because they want workers [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=146.84s)]
*  to fear having a union. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=151.04s)]
*  So they're trying to give them reasons not to join the union. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  But we know the members, those workers, they deserve their fair share. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=158.04s)]
*  And that's going to be the next phase of this, is organizing those places and giving those [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=162.68s)]
*  workers their full share of the fruits of their labor. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=165.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  I'll add to that, but just to recap what you just said, those numbers that you just went [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=169.6s)]
*  through are very similar to the deal that you worked out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=172.88s)]
*  11 percent pay increase immediately, a 25 percent pay increase over four and a half [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=181.28s)]
*  Cost of living adjustments reinstated. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=182.28s)]
*  Shortened time to the top wage from eight years to three years. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  I know that's a big deal. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=186.16s)]
*  Right to strength over plant closures and ending the two-tier pay structure, which I [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=187.56s)]
*  know from conversations I've had was an enormous deal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=190.8s)]
*  When you talk about looking to other places, let's talk about Tesla. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=194.0s)]
*  Which is the largest EV manufacturer in America and non-unionized. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=199.16s)]
*  And how important do you see that for the future of your union? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=203.56s)]
*  Well, I think one of the best, another thing we've done with this agreement, I mean, when [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=207.16s)]
*  I took over, we were DOA when it came to the EV battery work. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=211.32s)]
*  We were in a bad position. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=215.56s)]
*  And again, thanks to the power of the membership standing up, we were able to bargain some [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  of that work under our master agreements, under our standards. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=222.0s)]
*  We approached the White House and Congress about this issue, and our taxpayer dollars [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=225.8s)]
*  are helping fund that transition. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=229.0s)]
*  So we expect to bring that standard up everywhere. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=231.0s)]
*  And you know, the Elon Musk of the world that had the Teslas, you know, they want to, you [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=232.88s)]
*  know, that's how billionaires get their money. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=237.16s)]
*  They do it on the backs of the working-class people. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=238.88s)]
*  And you know, they take the profits, and other people go poor in the process of these people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=241.72s)]
*  getting rich so they can, you know, build rockets and fly themselves into outer space [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=245.94s)]
*  or whatever the hell it is they want to do with their spare time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  And you know, workers are fed up in this country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=252.16s)]
*  Our fight's not just for the UAW. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=255.28s)]
*  Our fight's for the entire working class. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=257.18s)]
*  And I think that's why 75% of Americans supported us in this fight. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=259.02s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk a little more about that, about that sort of transition. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  One thing, you talked about your contract, I think, is up May Day, 2028? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  No, it's a four-year deal? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=273.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=277.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's been four and a half years, so yes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=278.7s)]
*  And the idea that other unions negotiate similar contracts with similar dates, so a sort of, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=282.86s)]
*  you know, a sort of additive power to the threat of strike. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  What do you think the lesson has been from this year, not just for the United Auto Workers, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=292.88s)]
*  but we've seen it with the Writers Guild, we've seen it with SAG-AFTRA, we've seen [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=297.16s)]
*  it with flight attendants, we've seen it across the labor movement and across working people [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=300.54s)]
*  in this country, the most amount of strike activity we've seen in a generation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=304.72s)]
*  You know, look, working class people are fed up, union or not. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=310.12s)]
*  And I think, you know, COVID taught us a valuable lesson. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=312.52s)]
*  People reflected on what's important in life. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=315.52s)]
*  And what's important in life is not working seven days a week, 12 and 16 hours a day, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=318.0s)]
*  or working multiple jobs, scraping to get by, living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=322.12s)]
*  People want a life, and that's not a life. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=326.76s)]
*  And so I think that's what people are seeing now, is the pathway to having a better life [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=329.64s)]
*  is by organizing and joining a union. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=334.2s)]
*  I was very ecstatic we got May Day as an expiration date. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=336.56s)]
*  And I look forward to not just unions in this nation, but in this world, to align our dates. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=341.92s)]
*  And that's one thing we learned in that process, is we have the power. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=346.88s)]
*  When we withhold our labor, no matter where people work, nothing moves. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=350.36s)]
*  The billionaire class, the corporate class can build all the factories or businesses [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  they want, but if there aren't people there to do the work, nothing's going to move. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=357.94s)]
*  And so we have to harness that power, come together and organize and work together and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=361.24s)]
*  stand together, and we'll take our lives back. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=365.36s)]
*  Sean Fain, as president of that United Auto Workers Union, was just a very successful [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=368.48s)]
*  strike, the largest and longest in 22 years. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=376.16s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=377.16s)]
*  Hey, thank you, Chris. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4qcNiuxFfs&t=378.16s)]
