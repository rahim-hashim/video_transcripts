# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 27
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It is not often the case these days, but today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=0.0s)]
*  the Supreme Court issued a long anticipated monumental ruling that actually bolsters [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=5.12s)]
*  America's democratic strength. Now the case before the court today contained at its core [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=10.72s)]
*  an idea that was central to the Donald Trump scheme to overturn the 2020 elections. The question [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=16.4s)]
*  of whether state legislatures can do whatever they want in elections up to and including [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=22.72s)]
*  simply appointing electors to their preferred candidate even when the citizens of their state [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=28.32s)]
*  vote the other way. Trump's lawyers pushed the idea that Republican legislators in all kinds of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=33.6s)]
*  states could simply ignore the will of the people in states that voted for Joe Biden and opt instead [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=39.52s)]
*  to send their own fake electors, Trump electors, to Congress. It was fake electors in seven swing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=46.0s)]
*  states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and Nevada, that in coordination with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  the Trump campaign sought to overthrow the election results. Trump and his lawyer, John Eastman, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=57.6s)]
*  along with others, actively lobbied for and pushed this idea across multiple states, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=63.44s)]
*  trying in fact to get state legislatures to abandon their core democratic duty and choose [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=68.16s)]
*  instead a path to essentially crown Trump king. Here's the former speaker of the Arizona House, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=74.0s)]
*  Republican conservative Rusty Bowers, describing a 2020 call he got from Trump coup lawyer, John [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=81.12s)]
*  Eastman. And what did Dr. Eastman want you to do? That we would in fact vote, take a vote to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=88.08s)]
*  overthrow, or I shouldn't say overthrow, that we would decertify the electors and that that because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  we had plenary authority to do so. I said, what would you have me do? And he said, just do it and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=109.04s)]
*  let the court sort it out. Plenary authority, absolute, total authority. The state legislators [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=117.76s)]
*  have total authority over who wins an election. We now have new reporting from the Washington [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=123.76s)]
*  Post that special counsel Jack Smith has taken a keen interest in the fake electors plot, focusing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=129.36s)]
*  specifically on potential fraud. New York Times recently reported that one of the Trump campaign's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=135.2s)]
*  key players in the scheme may actually be cooperating with federal prosecutors. And [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  tomorrow, Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who Trump infamously called [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  and told to find roughly 11,000 votes to overturn the Georgia results, will meet with federal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  prosecutors for, as far as we know, the first time on the special counsel's team in Atlanta. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  We're gonna have more on the special counsel's investigation and the rapid developments coming [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=162.8s)]
*  up. But again, at the core of Trump's attempted coup, and there's a bunch of things going on, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=166.56s)]
*  but at its core, as articulated by John Eastman, as he told Rusty Bowers, is this bizarre, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=172.08s)]
*  to my mind, facially ludicrous fringe idea that conservatives ran with after their scheme failed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=178.56s)]
*  to return Trump to the White House. It's called the independent state legislature theory, although [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  calling it a theory gives it a little too much credit. And it would give state legislatures [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=189.44s)]
*  plenarily, virtually unchecked power over federal elections. It was an idea infamously pushed by [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=194.48s)]
*  coup memo author John Eastman and his allies in Congress. Basically says state legislatures [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=201.52s)]
*  are the ultimate arbiters of how elections are run in a state, no matter what state law [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=206.64s)]
*  or state officials or crucially state courts say. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=211.36s)]
*  That was a speech at the ellipse right before an angry mob went to the Capitol and bashed a bunch [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=241.36s)]
*  of cops' brains in. The insurrection on January 6th failed in its goal to subvert democracy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=256.72s)]
*  It failed to keep Donald Trump in office for a second term. But in many ways, the spirit of the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=263.04s)]
*  coup, of Donald Trump's multi-pronged plan to overturn the election results, continued and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=268.32s)]
*  continues. I mean, we've seen in state after state, like Arizona, Georgia, and Texas, Republicans [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=273.12s)]
*  stripping power from state elections officials and candidates vowing to abolish bipartisan [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  election commissions in states like Wisconsin. So this time it wasn't a violent mob, but politicians, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=284.88s)]
*  locally elected officials at the state level, trying to carry out a version of Eastman's vision, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=291.12s)]
*  to take power back from any official that has it delegated and give it all to the state legislatures [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  so that they can run elections entirely. Not coincidentally, those are also the places where [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=303.68s)]
*  Republicans have a lot of control. And they've been doing it right in front of all of us. I mean, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=308.96s)]
*  we were covering it back in May of 2021. In Arizona, Republican state legislators stripped [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=313.36s)]
*  Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, of her ability to defend election lawsuits. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=320.08s)]
*  And it gave the power to who? Well, exclusively to the attorney general, a Republican. We are [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=324.64s)]
*  watching essentially a slow motion insurrection being carried out by Republicans in suits and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=330.0s)]
*  ties in states all across the country. They are putting the pieces in place to do in the next [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=335.12s)]
*  elections what the mob failed to do on January 6th. And that slow motion insurrection, this idea [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=339.44s)]
*  from the right wing that the power of self-governance does not sit in the hands of the people, the idea [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=346.88s)]
*  that the power and oversight of elections belongs to basically Republican self-gerrymandered [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=352.56s)]
*  majorities in the state level. That idea, that core idea is the subject of today's monumental [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=358.16s)]
*  Supreme Court ruling. The case is out of the state of North Carolina. It's called Moore v. Harper. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=363.68s)]
*  And in it, North Carolina Republicans argued that this independent state legislature theory [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=368.4s)]
*  gave them virtually unchecked power over elections. The lawmakers argument hinges on a political [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=373.36s)]
*  concept called the independent state legislature theory based on the constitution's election clause [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=380.4s)]
*  saying the time, place, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof. So if the court lands on the side of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=390.56s)]
*  North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore and his Republican colleagues, Fredrickson explains it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=395.44s)]
*  could mean state legislatures can act independently and governors and state courts would have no [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  ability to check laws related to federal election. Well today in the 63 ruling, the Supreme Court [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=405.68s)]
*  rejected that extreme and dangerous legal theory, not to say one completely unfounded in the text [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=411.04s)]
*  of the constitution. The case centers around an extremely aggressive partisan North Carolina [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=418.0s)]
*  congressional math drawn by Republican in the Republican in the state legislature, very [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=422.72s)]
*  gerrymandered, using 2020 census data. And it's a map that would give Republicans up to 10 seats in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=428.56s)]
*  the House. In early 2022, the North Carolina Supreme Court threw out that gerrymandered map and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=434.4s)]
*  rejected Republicans' arguments that state courts had no role to play in drawing congressional maps. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=440.96s)]
*  And then conservatives tried to go over the state court's head, challenge the ruling on the cart, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  and went to the Supreme Court to argue that the constitution gives them and only them, us in the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  state legislature, the only and total power over how we draw congressional maps. State courts don't [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=457.44s)]
*  matter. Well today, the conservative Supreme Court that Donald Trump is responsible for shaping [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=463.84s)]
*  plainly rejected this radical and dare I say it, kooky notion. Chief Justice John Roberts authored [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  the 6-3 opinion with both Trump appointed justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett siding with [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  the liberals. Justice Clarence Thomas, Samuel Leto, and Neil Gorsuch dissented. In his opinion for the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=480.88s)]
*  majority, Chief Justice wrote that quote, legislatures, the framers recognized are the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=487.12s)]
*  mere creatures of the state constitutions and cannot be greater than their creators. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=491.44s)]
*  Meaning the state government as a whole functions to oversee elections. If there's a state [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=497.84s)]
*  constitution that's interpreted by state courts, they get a say. State legislatures aren't some [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=504.4s)]
*  like special magical power that overrules everything in the state. That's ludicrous. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=509.04s)]
*  This is the second pro-democracy ruling from this very right-wing court this term alone. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=515.76s)]
*  Remember a few weeks ago, they also upheld crucially section two of the Voting Rights Act [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  and struck down a flagrantly biased Alabama congressional map. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  And I can't read the minds of the justices, particularly Roberts and Kavanaugh, who are the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=530.16s)]
*  majority in both opinions, but I have to think the sustained focus amongst the press and civil society [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=533.52s)]
*  and politicians on the very real indeed existential threats to the American experiment as posed by [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  John Eastman, Donald Trump and his movement. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=547.44s)]
*  The focus on that has shaped the court's thinking and thank goodness for that. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=551.2s)]
*  Last summer, Cassie Hutchinson, remember her former aide in the Trump White House, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=556.96s)]
*  told the January 6 committee about that incident where Donald Trump wanted to join the rioters at [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=560.4s)]
*  the Capitol on January 6. Hutchinson told the committee that the story was told to her by [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=565.36s)]
*  Tony Ornato, an agent who left the Secret Service to become Trump's deputy chief of staff. Well, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  this week we've learned that about half a dozen Secret Service agents have testified before the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=575.44s)]
*  grand jury investigating Trump's attempts to overturn the election. We do not yet know if Ornato [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=580.0s)]
*  or Bobby Engel, who drove Trump that day, were among them. Special counsel Jack Smith is also [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=586.08s)]
*  investigating possible fraud by former Trump lawyers like Rudy Giuliani in their repeated false [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=591.12s)]
*  claims about the election, according to the Washington Post. In fact, CNN reports tonight [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  that Giuliani has been interviewed by federal investigators as part of the probe. Apparently, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=600.96s)]
*  that interview happened in recent weeks. And in yet another sign, this investigation is in full [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=606.24s)]
*  swing. Tomorrow, federal investigators are scheduled to interview Georgia Secretary of State [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=611.84s)]
*  Brad Raffensperger, who got the infamous call from Trump asking for just 11,780 votes. Betsy [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  Woodrow-Swan is a national correspondent at Politico and she joins me now. Betsy, there's a lot to get [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=623.36s)]
*  to here. First, I would just say as someone who's sort of reporting on the general investigation, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=630.0s)]
*  it does seem like there is more activity and more activity on the surface and we're learning more [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=636.88s)]
*  and more of the key players than we have ever seen before from Jack Smith on the January 6th [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=641.84s)]
*  part of the investigation. Yeah, that's no question. There's just a massive amount of churn [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=647.28s)]
*  going on right now in terms of what Jack Smith is up to. The way that this looks to some people [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=654.16s)]
*  watching from the outside is that Smith is needing to fill in certain gaps in his investigations, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=660.16s)]
*  calling back in witnesses who've already been interviewed, interviewing witnesses who've [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=666.48s)]
*  already produced materials that were subpoenaed, following up on outreaches that his team first [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  made many, many months ago. In the lead up to the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation, there were a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=678.16s)]
*  lot of folks in sort of the witness lawyer community who started getting a little bit of a spidey sense [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=685.04s)]
*  about an indictment coming, a little bit of a prickling on the back of the neck. I have yet to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=690.4s)]
*  speak to people who have that very specific sense about a possible indictment being imminent when it [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  comes to this January 6th investigative thread that Jack Smith is pulling, but there's no question [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=701.52s)]
*  that he's pulling it hard and there's no question that just because the criminal proceedings in South [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=707.44s)]
*  Florida are getting really, really busy, that does not appear whatsoever to be impeding this parallel [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=713.84s)]
*  work going on that's focused on the date of January 6th and the days leading up to it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=720.24s)]
*  So there's a few like main, what's striking to me is there's a, there's obviously a bunch of parallel [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=725.7600000000001s)]
*  inquiries that one would have around the entire scheme to overturn the election. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=732.08s)]
*  Raffensperger is someone that you would want to speak to, right? He's talking to him tomorrow. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=736.96s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani, obviously someone you would have to speak to. We find out just now that apparently [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=740.08s)]
*  he's talked to federal investigators. So the sort of big names, but then there's also like the fake [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=744.64s)]
*  electors and the fraud aspect of this. This is from the Washington Post reporting. The Justice [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=749.76s)]
*  Department's investigation of evidence by Donald Trump and his advisors to overturn the election. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=753.84s)]
*  Prosecutors focused on ads and fundraising pitches claiming election fraud, as well as plans for fake [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=757.52s)]
*  electors. And in fact, we know about that immunity to two of them from Nevada. That strikes me as [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=764.4s)]
*  significant. It was also an area the January 6th committee focused on. Yeah. And the fact that [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=771.04s)]
*  those two folks are from Nevada is particularly interesting. Of all the different states where the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=775.92s)]
*  alternate or fake electors scheme was ongoing, Nevada is important because the state legislature [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=781.52s)]
*  at the time, and I believe still was controlled entirely by Democrats and some of these other [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=786.96s)]
*  states, including Georgia, some of these fake electors, the day they signed the fake electoral [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  ballots said that they were acting under advice of counsel, that they were taking the steps they [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  were taking because maybe the state legislatures would do their thing and there would need to be [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  this backup remedy available. And that was something that some of those fake electors got lawyers to [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  tell them to do. But in Nevada, that explanation, of course, wouldn't hold water and wouldn't be [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=812.32s)]
*  relevant at all because there was a 0% chance that the Democratic controlled legislature in Nevada [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  was going to throw out the law of electoral votes. So the fact that Jack Smith's team, at least from [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=824.16s)]
*  where we sit, seems to be particularly leaning into the Nevada piece of this is uniquely interesting. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=830.0s)]
*  The fact that it's taken him so long to talk to Brad Brafensberger is also interesting. Of course, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=837.2s)]
*  everyone watching this show knows Bonnie Willis, the district attorney in Georgia, is working on a [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=843.2s)]
*  fast moving case, looking specifically at the Georgia piece of this probe. We also know DOJ [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=848.08s)]
*  doesn't like necessarily getting involved in redundant ways with state and local criminal [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=854.48s)]
*  proceedings. So the fact that there's been this action in Nevada, I think is particularly [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=860.72s)]
*  interesting. I think it's a state that people should be keeping an eye on as they're tracking [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=866.0s)]
*  the, it feels like, as they're tracking the zillions of threads that Jack Smith and his team [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=870.0s)]
*  are pulling right now. Yeah, that's a really, really great point. I hadn't even put that two [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=874.64s)]
*  and two together until you just said it. Betsy Woodruff-Swan, that's why we have you on. Thank you. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=878.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is now in full spin mode after he's been caught on tape in the classified documents [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=885.28s)]
*  case. As cited in Jack Smith's indictment of the ex-president, the audio is from a 2021 conversation [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=890.24s)]
*  Trump had with a couple of people working on a book about Mark Meadows. And it's pretty clear [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=896.16s)]
*  Trump has classified documents right there in the room and he's showing them off. NBC News has [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=900.64s)]
*  obtained the tape and we're going to play it for you in full. And then we'll play you Trump's attempt [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=906.24s)]
*  to explain this one away. It's very good. Stick around for that. So first here's Trump [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=911.44s)]
*  caught on tape in 2021. These are bad, sick people. That was your coup, you know, against you. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=916.0s)]
*  It started right at the beginning. Like when Milley's talking about, oh, you were going to try to do [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=925.04s)]
*  a coup. No, they were trying to do that before you even were sworn in. That's right. Trying to over [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=928.88s)]
*  throw your election. Well, with Milley, let me see that. I'll show you an example. He said that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=933.76s)]
*  I wanted to attack Iran. Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came up. Look. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=941.04s)]
*  This was him. They presented me this. This is off the record, but they presented me this. This was [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=950.08s)]
*  him. This was the Defense Department and him. We looked at something. This was him. This wasn't done [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=956.72s)]
*  by me. This was him. All sorts of stuff. Pages long. Wait a minute. Let's see here. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=963.12s)]
*  I just found, isn't that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know, except it is like highly [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=974.64s)]
*  confidential. There's a secret information. Look at this. You attack and Hillary would print that [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=981.04s)]
*  out all the time. She'd send it to Anthony Weiner, the pervert. By the way, isn't that incredible? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=989.12s)]
*  Yeah. I was just saying, because we were talking about it. He said he wanted to attack Iran and [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=999.28s)]
*  he's in the papers. This was done by the military, given to me. I think we can probably get it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1006.48s)]
*  We'll have to see. Yeah, we'll have to try to figure out. See, as president, I could have [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1015.84s)]
*  declassified. No, I can't. But this is declassifying. Now we have a problem. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1021.44s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? Yeah. It's so cool. Look, we heard Ivan. And you probably almost [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1025.6000000000001s)]
*  didn't believe me, but now you believe me. No, I believe you. It's incredible, right? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1032.32s)]
*  No. It brings some gokes in, please. This is secret information. Look at this, unquote. Okay, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1036.08s)]
*  so that's pretty damning. And it sure seems to debunk Trump's previous excuse. He magically [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1043.68s)]
*  classified all the documents he stole, possibly without telling anyone. Trump says he has the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1047.92s)]
*  document. You can hear him rifling through his beautiful mind, the piles of papers. And he [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1052.88s)]
*  admits he did not declassify the documents while president. You'd think this would be a pretty open [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1057.2s)]
*  and shut case at this point, but today the indicted ex-president offered a 12-point refutation of the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1062.5600000000002s)]
*  recording. Everything was fine. We did nothing wrong, and everybody knows it. You're not concerned, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1067.92s)]
*  then, with your own voice on those recordings? My voice was fine. What did I say wrong in those [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1074.64s)]
*  recordings? I didn't even see the recording. All I know is I did nothing wrong. We had a lot of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1079.92s)]
*  papers, a lot of papers stacked up. In fact, you could hear the rustle of the paper, and nobody [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1085.44s)]
*  said I did anything wrong other than the fake news, which of course is Fox, too. Are there any [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1090.4s)]
*  other recordings that we should be concerned of? I don't know of any recordings that you should be [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1097.12s)]
*  concerned with because I don't do things wrong. I do things right. I'm a legitimate person. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1103.04s)]
*  Save it for the judge, buddy. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1109.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sNxbyP5-Ec&t=1127.12s)]
