Video Description: Michael Beschloss joins Chris Hayes to discuss the rise in political violence in the age of Trump and why it is different than other moments in American history. “Now we’re in a situation where many more guns in America, gun safety laws have been relaxed. And you’ve got one of the two parties – the Republican party – absolutely seduced by Donald Trump, who loves violence. Who when he was president threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act or Marshall law to stop violence. This is now in the heart of America, not the fringe.”

# Political violence on the rise in the age of Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc)
*  Observers around the world are watching, of course, what has happened in the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=0.0s)]
*  the last few years. They've seen a deadly insurrection, sacking of the nation's capital. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=3.68s)]
*  Its president impeached twice, indicted four times, facing trial, possibly still poised [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=7.68s)]
*  to take back power. The country's Speaker of the House position made vacant by allies [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=12.48s)]
*  of the corrupt ex-president, and also the increasing political violence being carried out across [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=17.68s)]
*  the country by his followers. You can understand they quite understandably worry about the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=22.36s)]
*  stability of this country and what that means for the world. Michael Beschloss is NBC News [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=26.52s)]
*  presidential historian, and he joins me now. Michael, you know, one thing I always try [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=32.24s)]
*  to tell myself when I try to get too presentist is that, you know, the U.S. has been through [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=37.92s)]
*  periods of pretty intense political violence, obviously the Civil War and the political [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=44.28s)]
*  violence reconstruction, but in the 1920s, during the 1960s. So I want to put things [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  in a historical perspective. I'm curious where you sort of see us right now in that sense. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=54.68s)]
*  Well, it's a violent country. It's not the only thing to know about America. But just as you're [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=60.12s)]
*  saying, slavery was continuous violence for centuries, violence against Native Americans. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=64.68s)]
*  And just as you're saying, the Civil War and Jim Crow, and also in the early 1960s, for instance, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=70.68s)]
*  after John Kennedy sent a big civil rights bill to Congress, if you look at his FBI files, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=76.6s)]
*  the number of death threats against President Kennedy rose. 1990s, you know, the violence [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=82.76s)]
*  against the federal government both threatened an actual Oklahoma City, the bombing of the building, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=90.28s)]
*  other domestic terrorists threatening. But the difference between that time and this time is this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=96.2s)]
*  in the 1990s, for instance, when those threats were there, when the actual tragedy of Oklahoma [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=102.68s)]
*  City happened in 1995, we could rely on the president of the United States, both parties [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=108.44s)]
*  in Congress and across the country to say that violence of this kind is outside the American [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=115.64s)]
*  system and has to be stopped. Peace has to be restored. Now we're in a situation where [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  many more guns in America, gun safety laws have been relaxed. And you've got one of the two parties, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=128.36s)]
*  the Republican Party, absolutely seduced by Donald Trump, who loves violence, who when he [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=135.16s)]
*  was president threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act or martial law to stop violence. This is now [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=141.0s)]
*  in the heart of America, not on the fringe. Yeah. And that point about what you might call [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=149.56s)]
*  organic political violence by certain factions, and it might be quite sophisticated or deadly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=156.2s)]
*  in the case of Oklahoma City bombing. But that is the difference. The person who is likely to be [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=162.84s)]
*  the nominee of one of the two major parties, the leader of that party, his countenancing of it, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=169.8s)]
*  his encouraging... One of the most chilling moments, I didn't even mention it, but I want to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=173.88s)]
*  bring it up here and we're not going to play it because it's actually too despicable to do so. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=177.0s)]
*  But he was in that room in California at our fundraiser and he made a joke about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=180.52s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi's husband, who was savagely attacked, an 80-year-old man in his home. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=186.36s)]
*  He says, how's he doing? And the crowd roars. And that to me, the message that sends to anyone that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=194.52s)]
*  wants to do something horrible is that he's got your back, that he approves of it. And that to me [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  seems really pretty unique and uniquely dangerous. That's it. And in modern times, when did we ever [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=206.6s)]
*  hear a president or an ex-president ever say something remotely like that? And people applaud [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=213.56s)]
*  and it gets normalized. Plus in modern times, domestic terrorists and people like the one that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=220.2s)]
*  assaulted Paul Pelosi, perhaps, these people can now contact each other on the dark web. They [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=227.56s)]
*  couldn't do that in Jim Crow, Alabama in 1925. This is a very new period. And so if you get [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=234.44s)]
*  a possible next president of the United States, if Donald Trump is elected 13 months from today, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=242.44s)]
*  exactly, or if someone like Jim Jordan becomes speaker of the House, just as you were saying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=248.76s)]
*  earlier, Chris, where was he on January 6th? Why can't he remember what kind of conversations [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=254.52s)]
*  he had or did not have with Donald Trump at a time that Donald Trump may have been running [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=261.0s)]
*  that whole operation to wage a coup d'etat and conquer Congress? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=266.2s)]
*  One third of our Supreme Court was appointed by Donald Trump. We're not in a situation that we [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=271.32s)]
*  might have been in, let's say in the 90s, where we could depend on all three branches of our [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=277.56s)]
*  government to protect us against this kind of violence. Yeah. And there's also the question [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=283.08s)]
*  of federal law enforcement and what they do about it. And obviously, this is a longstanding question. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=289.4s)]
*  You have huge attacks against federal law enforcement in the 90s and what happened at [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=293.88000000000005s)]
*  Waco and Ruby Ridge providing inspiration for folks like Timothy McVeigh. And of course, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=299.88000000000005s)]
*  a very tortured and complicated legacy of how the FBI has dealt with this. I mean, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  incredibly despicable acts in COINTELPRO and things they did in the Red Scare, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=310.92s)]
*  but also going after the Klan in the South. You've got this situation now where [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=316.68s)]
*  the FBI is seen as the deep state and any motions they start to make to try to deal with this is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=321.0s)]
*  immediately subject to a political backlash in Congress and on Fox News. And what has [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=325.96s)]
*  Donald Trump said? He has said, flat out, elect me president. I will neutralize the FBI, which is a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=331.0s)]
*  malign organization. I'll do the same thing with the Department of Justice. And I will essentially [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=338.84s)]
*  point lackeys at the Pentagon. Can I say one more thing, Chris? Please. What you were saying at the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=344.36s)]
*  beginning, which was brilliant and trenchant, we should all pay attention to your warning, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=350.36s)]
*  reminded me a little bit of Franklin Roosevelt, who was very aware of vulnerable populations in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=355.0s)]
*  the United States. In the late 1930s, he said privately, direct quote, he said, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  if a demagogue ever took up anti-Semitic violence in America, he said, there would be more blood [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  running in the streets of New York City than in Berlin. You need a president to understand [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=373.16s)]
*  that this potential is there to protect every American against that, not to try to encourage it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=378.76s)]
*  Well said. Michael Beschloss, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc2GEohAJCc&t=385.8s)]
