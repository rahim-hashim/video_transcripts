# E. Jean Carroll attorney: Trump verdict proves 'your lies' catch up to you
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8)
*  Today's verdict is due in large part to the tenacity of E. Jean Carroll, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=0.0s)]
*  who declared it, quote, a great victory for everyone who stands up when she's knocked down, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=4.44s)]
*  a huge defeat for every bully who's tried to keep a woman down. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=8.76s)]
*  She went on to credit her amazing legal team for the win. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=11.92s)]
*  You can see her leaving the courtroom with key members of that team after the verdict came down. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=15.16s)]
*  I'm all leaving the courthouse after the verdict. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=19.48s)]
*  That's E. Jean Carroll in the middle with her lawyers, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=21.56s)]
*  Robbie Kaplan, Robbie Kaplan is on the right of your screen, and Sean Crowley. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=23.98s)]
*  Sean Crowley joins me live here on set tonight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=28.56s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=30.72s)]
*  So great to be here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=33.04s)]
*  I'm feeling good. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=34.12s)]
*  You look you came into you came into the studio be beaming a smile that was clearly authentic and coming from the deepest part of you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=35.12s)]
*  It's been a good day. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=42.6s)]
*  I guess first, did you anticipate this basically after the week that you had? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=44.92s)]
*  You know, it's really hard to predict what juries are going to do. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  I think we certainly anticipated that they would believe E. Jean Carroll's testimony. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=56.32s)]
*  It was credible. It was moving. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  Did we expect that the punitive damages award would be quite so high? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=63.28s)]
*  I don't really know. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=67.68s)]
*  I mean, the way that Donald Trump conducted himself throughout this case and then throughout this trial, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=68.4s)]
*  storming in and out of the courtroom, shaking his head, saying things very loudly when he was sitting in the back, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  going leaving the courtroom to repeatedly defame Miss Carroll while the trial was going on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=81.64s)]
*  The jury saw and heard all of those things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=87.36s)]
*  So we expected that there would be some award that would be high enough that they would think maybe we should actually penalize him and get him to stop doing this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=90.08s)]
*  So that was going to be my next question about his behavior here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=99.92s)]
*  And you're not a psychologist. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=102.56s)]
*  You just have to deal with it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=104.56s)]
*  But did you have like a tactical posture, honestly, about what to do about this? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=105.36s)]
*  Because I can't imagine as a litigator, even as a prosecutor, you've ever faced something quite like this, have you? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=111.28s)]
*  I haven't. No. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=116.76s)]
*  I mean, people don't do this in courtrooms. They just don't. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=117.64s)]
*  Usually people who come into courtrooms for trials stay for the trial. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=120.12s)]
*  They don't walk out furiously and come in and say things when the jury can hear them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=124.04s)]
*  I haven't encountered anything like this before. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=129.12s)]
*  And so I guess the question becomes like, to the extent there's any, you know, method to the madness, I don't think there is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=131.28s)]
*  I think it's actually just incontinent ability to self-regulate. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=137.0s)]
*  You know, what you do with it as attorneys and how you sort of keep on track, like, was there a strategy for that? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=141.76s)]
*  Our strategy was really just to remember that we were in a court of law and that we were trying this case to the jury and in front of a judge. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=149.28s)]
*  I think Donald Trump's strategy was much bigger than that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  He wasn't really as concerned with what was happening in the court of law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=160.84s)]
*  And he was much more concerned with what was happening with his followers and fan base and at his rallies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=164.08s)]
*  So we just tried to focus on what we were actually doing and not get too distracted by the antics going on around outside. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  I want to I want to show you an image that one of our producers took a picture of this evening. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=177.08s)]
*  I think we have it. Let me know if we do. There it is. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=181.56s)]
*  This is outside Trump Tower here. E three point three million. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=184.52s)]
*  Ha ha ha. Keep talking, loser. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  That was chalked outside the Trump International Telling. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Here, I thought you get it. You have to respond to it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  I thought you get a kick out of it. Tell me about. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  OK, what happens next year? Right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  So his lawyer came out and said, we've got great grounds for an appeal. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=202.04s)]
*  I mean, obviously, lawyers are always say that they always say you're going to appeal. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=205.72s)]
*  Obviously, you have you get an appeal under due process in the same way you might in a criminal case. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=208.12s)]
*  So what's the next step? So we have every expectation that they will appeal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  We feel very good about our arguments on appeal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  We actually, as you as you said, there was a trial last year about the actual sexual assault and another defamation. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=222.44s)]
*  And there the jury not only found that he sexually assaulted her, but also awarded E. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=229.44s)]
*  Jean Carroll five million dollars. That case is already on appeal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=233.52s)]
*  The money has been paid into the court. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=238.04s)]
*  And so once we hope we win the appeal, that money will go to Miss Carol. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=240.28s)]
*  This case likewise will be appealed. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=245.84s)]
*  We feel confident in our arguments. And ultimately, she will collect that judgment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=248.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to be like this is a little minutiae, but I actually want to get into it because I think there's always some sense. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=252.2s)]
*  It's like the it's like the road runner, like above never falling where it's like, is he going to have to pay up? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=257.08s)]
*  And so my understanding, the procedure is sort of basically like escrow where like you have to pony up the money into some account that sits there until the appeal is done. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=263.36s)]
*  Is that correct? That's that's basically correct. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  So like he's not going to be able to unless he wins on appeal, he's going to have to pay this money. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=272.68s)]
*  He's going to have to pay at least a big portion of this money before he even wins on appeal. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=277.12s)]
*  It has to be there to be certain that it's going to be there when we win the appeal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=281.68s)]
*  And then certainly after the appeal is we hope we're victorious on appeal. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=285.72s)]
*  He's going to have to pay it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=290.48s)]
*  Can we talk about the pace of this? So this starts in twenty nineteen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  One of the things I was talking about on this program last night is about the cliche, the wheels of justice grind slow, but exceedingly fine. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=297.32s)]
*  You've been a lawyer. You've worked in both criminal and civil contexts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=303.56s)]
*  I mean, I'm just sort of awestruck by the endurance at some level, like for four years of her life, E. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=307.92s)]
*  Jean Carroll. What what is your conclusion about how long this takes to get this accountability? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  So this case has been very long, but for sort of for extraordinary reasons. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=323.0s)]
*  E. Jean sued Donald Trump for something that he did first while he was president for defaming her while he was president. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=329.4s)]
*  And because of that, he defended the case for many years, basically saying a first he got the Department of Justice to intervene on his behalf. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=336.76s)]
*  That didn't work. And then he claimed, well, you can't sue me for something that I did while I was president. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=346.52s)]
*  And then he claimed, well, I made those statements, but I was acting within the scope of my employment as president. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=351.48s)]
*  It was my official duties to say to lie and defame this woman who accused me of sexual assault. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=357.24s)]
*  Right. And so that took a while. It wound its way through the courts here in New York. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=362.52s)]
*  It took a detour to D.C. for a while and it came back. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=366.84s)]
*  The other case actually moved extremely quickly because he just to be clear, and people probably don't know this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=370.88s)]
*  So the first is E. Jean Carroll publishes the book, President Defames Her. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=376.0s)]
*  That's correct. She sues him. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=379.64s)]
*  It says, I want to go and I want to go into court and prove this allegation that I'm telling the truth and you're you're defaming when you say I'm lying. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=381.0s)]
*  And he used all of the powers of the presidency to protect himself. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=387.56s)]
*  Then he gets out of the White House. And what happens a few days before his deposition? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=392.24s)]
*  In that case, in October of twenty twenty two, he defames her again. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=397.2s)]
*  He says basically the same thing. And by that time, New York had actually passed a law that allowed survivors of sexual assaults that had happened a long time ago to sue. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=401.4s)]
*  It opened a one year window where they could do that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=411.24s)]
*  So E. Jean filed another lawsuit in November of twenty twenty two, suing him both for the underlying sexual assault and for his defamation in October of twenty twenty two. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=413.76s)]
*  That case was filed November on Thanksgiving Day, I think, or the day after of twenty twenty two and went to trial last May. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=423.28s)]
*  Now, this one comes back around. He is no longer president. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=432.12s)]
*  Whatever civil immunity he may have had is gone. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  Side note, you can understand why a person who has just had an eighty three million dollar judgment would love to be president again with the cloak of civil legal protection that gave him in the past. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=441.76s)]
*  Just a note. Ultimately, what is the lesson here, though, about accountability? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=452.68s)]
*  I hope and I believe very strongly after today that the lesson is that actually no one's above the law, you know, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=459.12s)]
*  and that your behavior and your statements and your threats and your lies are going to catch up to you someday. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=467.28s)]
*  I have to say just I've not had an opportunity to meet your client, but I just I am completely in awe of her fortitude and endurance and ecstatic on her behalf, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=476.84s)]
*  although I think and I think you've said this like she would trade it to not have been defended in the first place. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=490.52s)]
*  Yeah, she said that on the on the stand. I mean, I think it was certainly very important to her to come forward and then to defend herself when he called her a liar and defamed her, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=495.72s)]
*  but the reputation that she has now is among a very large group of people really ruined by Donald Trump. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  And what she really wants is to be that journalist and advice columnist that she was before he lied about her. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=514.0400000000001s)]
*  Sean Crowley, you you and Robby Kaplan did amazing work. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=520.84s)]
*  Congratulations on a well-earned victory from my perspective. Happy birthday. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=524.2s)]
*  It's a birthday gift. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1maaZbpe8&t=527.24s)]
