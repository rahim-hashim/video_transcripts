# ‘Tortured legal logic’: Trump dealt blow over bid to dismiss stolen docs case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump spent the afternoon where he spends many afternoons these days in court. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=2.0s)]
*  He attended a procedural hearing in Florida as part of one of the federal criminal cases against him. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=6.0s)]
*  Specifically, the one where prosecutors accused him of stealing highly classified government secrets [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=12.0s)]
*  and then many times willfully obstructing justice by hiding the stolen documents from the government [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=17.0s)]
*  and repeatedly lying about it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=24.0s)]
*  Now, this case, I will admit, has receded a little bit from public memory, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=26.0s)]
*  in large part, I think, because of the rather glacial pace at which it's moving. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=30.0s)]
*  And that is thanks to one Judge Aline Cannon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=35.0s)]
*  Judge Cannon was plucked from obscurity by Donald Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=38.0s)]
*  He elevated her to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench when she was just 39. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=41.0s)]
*  Cannon was confirmed by the Senate in that brief lame duck session after Trump lost the 2020 election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=46.0s)]
*  She is now the one presiding over the documents case. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=52.0s)]
*  She has done her best to slow the speed of the case down to a crawl. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=55.0s)]
*  But it's worth keeping the details in this federal indictment in front of mind [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=59.0s)]
*  because they really are truly damning. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=62.0s)]
*  Every time I go back to them, I'm like, oh my word. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=64.0s)]
*  That is, in fact, why one key witness in the case came forward just this week [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=67.0s)]
*  to basically circumvent Judge Cannon's delay tactics [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=72.0s)]
*  and share what he knows directly with the American people ahead of November's election. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=75.0s)]
*  Brian Butler, a multi-decade employee of Mar-a-Lago, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=80.0s)]
*  says he unwittingly helped Trump's co-defendant, Waltine Natta, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=83.0s)]
*  move boxes of classified documents to the ex-president's plane [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=87.0s)]
*  on the same day Trump was supposed to meet with federal prosecutors [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=91.0s)]
*  about those documents at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=95.0s)]
*  You noticed that he had boxes? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=99.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, they were the boxes that were in the indictment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=101.0s)]
*  The white banker's boxes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=104.0s)]
*  That's what I remember loading. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=106.0s)]
*  And did you have any idea at the time that there was potentially [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=108.0s)]
*  U.S. national security secrets in those boxes? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=112.0s)]
*  No clue. No, I had no clue. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=114.0s)]
*  I mean, we were just taking them out of the escalator, piling them up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=117.0s)]
*  I remember they were all stacked on top of each other, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=120.0s)]
*  and then we're lifting them up to the pilot. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=122.0s)]
*  Again, Trump is meeting at Mar-a-Lago with the FBI [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=125.0s)]
*  about the documents they say he has, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=128.0s)]
*  as Butler and Natta are loading said documents onto a plane. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=131.0s)]
*  Butler also recounted Trump's attempted cover-up of his crimes [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=136.0s)]
*  in the form of a conversation with another Trump ally at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=139.0s)]
*  I remember him saying, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=144.0s)]
*  hey, by the way, Walt's coming tomorrow. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=145.0s)]
*  Oh, cool, that's great. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=147.0s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=148.0s)]
*  It wasn't until the following day when we're out walking, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=149.0s)]
*  he's like, hey, by the way, it's a secret. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=153.0s)]
*  Don't tell anybody Walt's coming. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=155.0s)]
*  And why? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=157.0s)]
*  Well, he needs me to find something out before he gets here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=160.0s)]
*  Oh, what's that? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=164.0s)]
*  He needs me to, you know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=165.0s)]
*  how long the camera footage is saved at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=166.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, that's odd. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=169.0s)]
*  Why do you need the camera footage? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=171.0s)]
*  Why do you need to know how long it's saved? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=173.0s)]
*  And his response was, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=175.0s)]
*  I think they're looking for somebody that was there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=176.0s)]
*  I think the American people have the right to know the facts [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=179.0s)]
*  that this is not a witch hunt. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=182.0s)]
*  That claim from the ex-president, this is all a big witch hunt, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=185.0s)]
*  is effectively what his lawyers argued in court today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=188.0s)]
*  They tried to get the case dismissed this afternoon [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=193.0s)]
*  using some torture legal logic, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=195.0s)]
*  including a claim the law was, quote, unconstitutionally vague. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=197.0s)]
*  Now, Judge Cannon ultimately rejected that particular argument today, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=201.0s)]
*  choosing instead to basically kick the question down the road. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=205.0s)]
*  It was sort of not really resolved. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=208.0s)]
*  But in some senses, that's beside the point, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=210.0s)]
*  as we keep hammering day after day on this program. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=212.0s)]
*  Trump's main goal is simply to run out the clock, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=215.0s)]
*  and crucially, Cannon did not give any update today [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=217.0s)]
*  on when she might actually bring this case to trial. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=220.0s)]
*  That's really the crux of the whole issue. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=223.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is facing serious legal jeopardy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=225.0s)]
*  Both federal indictments against him are incredibly damning. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=228.0s)]
*  But even with access to money from small dollar donors, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=231.0s)]
*  now possibly the Republican National Committee, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=234.0s)]
*  the legal bills are going to continue to pile up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=236.0s)]
*  And even with the best representation available, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=238.0s)]
*  the ex-president's best bet was never seeking an acquittal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=241.0s)]
*  by a jury of his peers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=244.0s)]
*  The evidence against him is simply too strong for that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=246.0s)]
*  No, his best strategy was to simply find ways to delay [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=248.0s)]
*  all the cases against him until November, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=252.0s)]
*  when he could potentially get elected president, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=254.0s)]
*  and then as president, at least regards the federal cases, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=256.0s)]
*  order his own Justice Department to abandon the pending cases against him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=259.0s)]
*  And that seemed like a wild strategy play. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=264.0s)]
*  But in all honesty, it looks like he might actually get away with it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=268.0s)]
*  I mean, look, sometimes, oftentimes, delays happen in the judicial system, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=272.0s)]
*  even when judges are acting in good faith. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=277.0s)]
*  We saw an example today when the Manhattan District Attorney's Office [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=279.0s)]
*  moved to delay its looming case against Trump for procedural reasons. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=282.0s)]
*  That's the case where the ex-president is accused of bribing a porn star [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=286.0s)]
*  ahead of a 2016 election to keep quiet about a affair [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=290.0s)]
*  they apparently had while his wife Melania was at home [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=293.0s)]
*  taking care of their newborn son. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=296.0s)]
*  This money was paid just weeks before the election. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=298.0s)]
*  It was supposed to go to trial in a matter of days, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=301.0s)]
*  but both sides have now agreed to push that date back [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=304.0s)]
*  in response to tens of thousands of pages of discovery material [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=306.0s)]
*  that was recently made available by federal prosecutors [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=310.0s)]
*  to New York prosecutors. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=313.0s)]
*  Bragg's office has asked for just a one-month delay. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=315.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers have predictably asked for three months. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=318.0s)]
*  We've also seen a delay in the Fulton County, Georgia racketeering case [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=321.0s)]
*  against Trump over potentially inappropriate relationship [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=324.0s)]
*  District Attorney Fonny Willis had with one of her prosecutors [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=327.0s)]
*  A relationship constitutes a conflict of interest. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=330.0s)]
*  Either those delays are ideal, but they're sort of different in scope [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=334.0s)]
*  and motivation from the other more weaponized delay tactics [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=337.0s)]
*  that we've seen in these federal cases. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=340.0s)]
*  Delay tactics aided and abetted by members of the judiciary who, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=342.0s)]
*  oh, by the way, Donald Trump handpicked for their jobs. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=345.0s)]
*  Like the Supreme Court of the United States with its extreme [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=350.0s)]
*  six-member MAGA majority, three of whom owe their lifetime tenure [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=352.0s)]
*  to the ex-president. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=356.0s)]
*  They have bent over backwards to appease Trump's desire for delay [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=358.0s)]
*  by sitting on his bogus immunity appeal for weeks [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=361.0s)]
*  before then scheduling oral arguments for literally the latest date [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=363.0s)]
*  that they are allowed, the last day of oral arguments. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=367.0s)]
*  It's all a part of what looks to all the world, at least at this point, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=370.0s)]
*  like a flagrant bid to push Trump's federal January 6 trial [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=373.0s)]
*  until after the election. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=377.0s)]
*  That brings us back to Judge Alien Cannon in Florida. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=379.0s)]
*  Through the luck of the draw, randomly, she was assigned to Trump's documents case. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=382.0s)]
*  At every single moment where she could choose between expedition or delay, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=386.0s)]
*  she has more or less always chosen to delay. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=389.0s)]
*  Now is when the rubber really hits the road because she's eventually going to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=393.0s)]
*  have to actually set a real trial date. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=395.0s)]
*  We'll see if she chooses the most obvious form of favor for the guy who gave her [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=398.0s)]
*  the job she currently holds and could very well promote her more in the future, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=401.0s)]
*  delaying his trial until after the election. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=405.0s)]
*  It's entirely possible. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=408.0s)]
*  It's why one conservative commentator gloated that Trump hit the quote [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=410.0s)]
*  inside straight. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=413.0s)]
*  He needed to avoid legal accountability before the election. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=414.0s)]
*  It's true. He was dealt a good hand. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=417.0s)]
*  It's looking like it was only because he hired the dealers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=419.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsRNWBiqDw&t=443.0s)]
