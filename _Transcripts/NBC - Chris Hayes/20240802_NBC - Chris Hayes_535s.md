# Simone Biles trolls Trump ‘I love my Black job’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY)
*  Janie Vance is a pretty weird guy and he's always been a weird guy from his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=0.0s)]
*  childless cat lady comments to what he said about decorated Olympian [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=4.88s)]
*  acknowledging her limits back in 2021. What I find so weird about this and it [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=9.56s)]
*  reflects more on the media than it does on Simone Biles is that we've tried to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=15.92s)]
*  turn a very tragic moment Simone Biles quitting the Olympic team into this act [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=19.68s)]
*  of heroism and I think it reflects pretty poorly on our sort of therapeutic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=24.44s)]
*  society that we try to praise people not for moments of strength not for moments [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=28.56s)]
*  of heroism but for their weakest moments. It's not praising people it's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=33.16s)]
*  acknowledging their public troubles and acknowledging that is not you know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=38.76s)]
*  unnormal it's a normal thing to do and that was a super weird thing to say [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=45.72s)]
*  about Simone Biles. The weird comments like that are a hallmark of this ticket [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=49.92s)]
*  Just listen to that guy at the top. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=55.64s)]
*  They're taking black jobs now and it could be 18 it could be 19 and even 20 [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=57.64s)]
*  million people they're taking black jobs. They're taking their jobs and they're [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  taking the black jobs. I will tell you that coming from the border are [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=69.04s)]
*  millions and millions of people that happen to be taking black jobs. You had [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=76.4s)]
*  the best. What exactly is a black job sir? A black job is anybody that has a job. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=81.28s)]
*  Well Simone Biles had the perfect response to both of those men on the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=86.48s)]
*  Republican ticket. To Vance questioning her abilities she is now the most [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=92.6s)]
*  decorated gymnast in US history and to Donald Trump this morning the six-time [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=97.04s)]
*  gold medalist tweeted quote I love my black job. I'm joined now by congresswoman [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=102.48s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett Democrat of Texas. Welcome congresswoman you're loving your [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=108.72s)]
*  black job. It's good to see you chairman. I am. I'm loving my black job right now too so it's good that we got work. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=113.32s)]
*  You know this this is about about as crazy and weird as it gets but you know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=122.8s)]
*  what I really enjoy about you in addition to your public service is the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=129.28s)]
*  fact that you call it out and you acknowledge it and you lean into to try [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=135.4s)]
*  to help contextualize it against the backdrop of the real work that we're [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=139.88s)]
*  seeing that needs to be done in Congress. You know when you're telling you know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=145.12s)]
*  that the intro seeing him talk they're talking about his family his young son [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=148.96s)]
*  that way going after Simone Biles who was very public about a very difficult [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=153.12s)]
*  thing. What should the public be making of moments like this? You know as you in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=157.6s)]
*  your work try to contrast what you're going through in the house with a lot of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=164.12s)]
*  weirdness but then in moments from the presidential campaign that we see from [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  JD Vanson for the vice president. Yeah you know what is so frustrating is that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=171.56s)]
*  these are the guys that their answer to everything is DEI and they are basically [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=177.36s)]
*  trying to minimize black folk and saying the only types of jobs that we can have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=182.4s)]
*  are the jobs say that someone who's immigrating from somewhere else and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=186.68s)]
*  coming to our country which for the most part these are entry-level jobs those [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  are the only jobs were qualified for right like you can't be the goats when [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=196.2s)]
*  it comes to the Olympics you can't be me and sit in Congress and and and the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  reality is that these are people that are not qualified for the positions in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=206.62s)]
*  which they're running for and it is a threat when you are a Donald Trump who [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=211.92s)]
*  just happens to be born with a silver spoon in his mouth who never worked for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=217.12s)]
*  anything a day in his life and when he did start working it was always trying [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=220.78s)]
*  to perpetrate a fraud that's what we saw him do with his businesses whether [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=224.94s)]
*  we're talking about real estate or if we're talking about his fake universities [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=228.9s)]
*  it's always been a fraud and right now he's trying to perpetrate a fraud on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=233.58s)]
*  the American people not once but for a second time and we rejected it the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=237.18s)]
*  second time and I'm looking forward to him being rejected again when a black [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=243.5s)]
*  woman shows him that her black job her next black job is being the president of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=248.42s)]
*  the United States yeah that'll be quite a moment and particularly when you think [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=254.22s)]
*  about what Politico has as a headline about JD Vance suggesting that the vice [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=259.14s)]
*  presidential picks don't matter so that tells us what he thinks about his job [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=265.18s)]
*  that he's trying to go after so you know and it really in so many ways when you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=270.5s)]
*  looked at and saw the evolution of those those moments at NABJ the National [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=275.82s)]
*  Association of Black Journalists you really saw Donald Trump being confronted [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=282.34s)]
*  with the question okay tell us you brought this up what is it and then [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=286.98s)]
*  stumbling when he's pressed to express it and explain it the same with DEI you [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=292.14s)]
*  know when he's asked okay okay what about DEI and he's like well define it [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=298.02s)]
*  yeah diversity equity and inclusion and he didn't he couldn't pull the trigger [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  to understand it and yet you have him right now using these terms to try to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  divide the population how do you see Kamala Harris's campaign having dealt [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  with some of this so far as she gets ready to roll out her VP nomination a [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  choice as well as the Democratic Convention going into Labor Day weekend [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  celebrating the the labor of men men and women across this country and then the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=329.5s)]
*  campaign yeah so you know what I tell people all the time is that the the vice [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=333.94s)]
*  president has been a black woman her whole life I know that Donald Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=339.58s)]
*  tried to say that she just became one at some point in time I got news for him [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=342.42s)]
*  she came into this earth as a black woman she will leave this earth as a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=347.1s)]
*  black woman and so what people don't understand is that this is the skin that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=350.5s)]
*  she is lived in and she has consistently been in spaces that others [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=354.62s)]
*  said that she should never ever enter right like she is consistently shattered [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=359.06s)]
*  glass ceilings and so this is someone that is used to people looking at her [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=363.54s)]
*  and believing that she's inferior simply because she's a woman and or a woman of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=368.66s)]
*  color when in reality they knew that they were the ones that probably were [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=373.42s)]
*  not on her level and probably should never have been in the same spaces with [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=377.9s)]
*  her and so I think that she is handling this with the grace that she has but at [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  the same time just like Simone Biles knew how to clap back when we saw the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=386.46s)]
*  vice president right here in Atlanta Georgia clap back and say listen you got [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=391.02s)]
*  a lot to say say it to my face what he's gonna learn is that black women one [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  thing we are very good at is is the clap back and we know how to stand on [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=401.02s)]
*  business and I think that that's what we're gonna see but one of the important [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=405.78s)]
*  points that I do want to make about NABJ and the fact that Donald Trump had to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=408.66s)]
*  sit down for an actual interview for actual journalism this is what is so [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=413.1s)]
*  threatening for him this is why in project 2025 they don't want independent [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=418.06s)]
*  journalism which is one of those things that we value in a democracy is the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=423.14000000000004s)]
*  freedom of press and it's something that they are trying to make sure that we [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=428.06s)]
*  can turn back the hands of time on this is why he loves a person like Putin [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=431.62s)]
*  because Putin controls the propaganda and that's what he's gotten out of Fox [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=436.3s)]
*  News I thought that Fox News would decide that they would go back and want [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=440.74s)]
*  to do the right thing after they got sued for millions and had to pay up but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=445.26s)]
*  listen so long as people are tuning in they're making that money back again and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=449.94s)]
*  they continue to pretend to be I call them faux news right like they pretend to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=454.1s)]
*  be actual journalists but they're not what we saw was actual journalism and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=459.42s)]
*  honestly the only time that Donald Trump seems to be challenged is when [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=463.94s)]
*  there is a black woman on the other side whether we're talking about Letitia James [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=468.14s)]
*  or we're talking about Fonny Willis or we're talking about the vice president [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=472.82s)]
*  who will become the president or we're talking about those black women [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=476.82s)]
*  journalists such as Rachel that decided that they were going to say no sir and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=479.94s)]
*  follow up and try to get answers it's what we actually needed in the last [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=485.14s)]
*  debate and if he does decide that he is going to come out from his scary little [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=489.98s)]
*  corner and debate the vice president I do hope whoever ends up being the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  moderators that they learn a thing or two and go back to what journalism looks [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  like and they hold his feet to the fire all right Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  with the clap back I love it thank you so much [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=511.14000000000004s)]
*  you [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9CQGn4-ImY&t=519.98s)]
