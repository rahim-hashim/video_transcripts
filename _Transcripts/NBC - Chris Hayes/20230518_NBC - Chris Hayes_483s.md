Video Description: Chris Hayes on the push to ban gender-affirming care for minors: The sick irony is the right-wing movement that demanded and produced a situation in which the government decides if your child can receive a certain kind of health care is the very same group that screamed about parental rights for years amidst the pandemic.

# DeSantis pushes child health care bans, fights with Disney in his ‘MAGA kingdom’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, it is official Florida [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis is running for the Republican nomination for president. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=3.84s)]
*  NBC News confirms he will file the paperwork and make a formal announcement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  next week. And of course, this is not a surprise. It has been widely anticipated [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=12.24s)]
*  because for months DeSantis has been hitting the donor circuit and the early [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=16.38s)]
*  campaign trail making appearances in Iowa, New Hampshire. And in fact, he has [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=20.38s)]
*  turned his entire governing agenda in Florida into a kind of set piece for his [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=24.62s)]
*  presidential campaign. He has been waging a culture war on his own [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  constituents for the purpose of elevating himself. It's a very clear and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=35.42s)]
*  coherent strategy. While Ron DeSantis tours around the country promoting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=40.5s)]
*  himself and his new memoir titled The Courage to Be Free, at home he runs a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=44.94s)]
*  government based on the opposite of freedom. His agenda is about state [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=50.26s)]
*  authority and its punitive use and decrees from on high. In Florida, he is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=54.98s)]
*  running a kind of little MAGA kingdom in which Ron DeSantis and the Republican [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=60.22s)]
*  Party in the state legislature with their big majorities tell you how to live your [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=65.08s)]
*  life and you don't get to choose. Now we're hearing the word authoritarian a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=69.06s)]
*  lot more these days. In the wake of the first ever attempt to overturn American [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=74.22s)]
*  democracy, particularly we use it on the show, Donald Trump encouraged those [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=77.82s)]
*  authoritarian impulses and Ron DeSantis has stoked them. He's put them into [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=81.74s)]
*  practice. But I think the discussion about the threat of authoritarianism [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=86.41999999999999s)]
*  can sometimes feel almost a little remote or academic. That word has a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=90.66s)]
*  certain kind of historical timbre to it. We associate the term with like stern [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  historical figures like Stalin or Mussolini and that can make it hard to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  look at Mr. Puddingfingers yucking it up on the campaign trail in Iowa and see an [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=103.34s)]
*  authoritarian. But Ron DeSantis really is running on an authoritarian agenda. The [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=108.34s)]
*  policies he has enacted in Florida are the opposite of freedom. To me, the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=115.42s)]
*  opposite of core American values because in Ron DeSantis' Florida, the state will [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=120.34s)]
*  decide what books your child can or cannot read in their school library by [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=125.02s)]
*  threatening teachers and librarians with time in prison. If they do not comply [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=129.62s)]
*  with vague laws about instruction on race, gender and sexuality, the state [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=134.34s)]
*  will decide what women can do with their own bodies by banning abortion at six [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=138.74s)]
*  weeks. Of course, that is for all intents and purposes, a complete abortion ban, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=143.22000000000003s)]
*  which means that Ron DeSantis and the Republican Party of Florida control the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  bodies of every Floridian who can get pregnant. It's their body, not yours. The [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=152.38000000000002s)]
*  state will also decide how you can dress in public, which costumes you can wear [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=157.66s)]
*  by enacting what is essentially a full ban on drag performances that will also [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=162.58s)]
*  likely restrict pride events. The state will decide what kind of speech [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=166.74s)]
*  corporations can engage in, including which criticisms they can make of the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=171.02s)]
*  government by going after Disney punitively for speaking out against [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=175.26s)]
*  anti LGBTQ laws. That fight has become quite notorious, blew up to the point [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=180.02s)]
*  that Disney announced today it's abandoning a one billion dollar planned [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  development in Florida. We'll see what sort of reprisals the state wages [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=190.1s)]
*  against that company. But Ron DeSantis' dystopian authoritarian vision is most [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  apparent in the legislation he just signed yesterday. It bans all gender [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  affirming care for all minors in Florida, everyone 18 and younger. That law [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=206.98s)]
*  also empowers state courts to change custody agreements if a child is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  receiving or is at risk of receiving gender affirming care, meaning taking a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=216.1s)]
*  kid away from a parent. Telling parents how they can or cannot raise their own [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=221.54s)]
*  children is among the most authoritarian things the government can do. And now [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=227.26s)]
*  that is exactly what Ron DeSantis and the Republican Party in Florida and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  generally the conservative movement that endorses this are doing purely for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=235.77999999999997s)]
*  ideological and punitive purposes. Now the sick irony here, the one that I just [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=240.22s)]
*  can't get over and really kind of sticks with me, is that the right wing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  movement that gave us this new law signed yesterday is the very same group [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=249.58s)]
*  of people that screamed about parental rights for years amidst the pandemic. I [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=254.86s)]
*  get to say whether my kid wears a mask, I get to say whether my kid gets [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  vaccinated, I get to say whether my kid goes to school. And Ron DeSantis, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=265.06s)]
*  was the public face of that movement. He wants to have the government force [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=270.18s)]
*  kindergartners to wear masks in school. He doesn't believe the parents should [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=276.42s)]
*  have a say in that. He thinks that should be a decision for the government. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=281.42s)]
*  Well, I can tell you in Florida, the parents are going to be the ones in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=285.3s)]
*  charge of that decision. Joe Biden suggests that if you don't do lockdown [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=288.18s)]
*  policies, then you should quote get out of the way. But let me tell you this, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=293.74s)]
*  if you're coming after the rights of parents in Florida, I'm standing in your [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=297.82s)]
*  way. I'm not going to let you get away with it. What a tough guy. You see all [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=301.94s)]
*  that swagger? He's going to stand in your way if you're coming after parental [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=306.73999999999995s)]
*  rights. If you try to tell a parent what they can do with their kids, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=310.17999999999995s)]
*  that very same wing of the Republican Party, embodied by Ron DeSantis and the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=314.34s)]
*  government of the state of Florida, has now demanded and produced a situation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=318.26s)]
*  in which the government, that guy you saw there with the tough guy swagger [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=322.38s)]
*  about freedom, is going to decide if your child who lives in your home that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=325.74s)]
*  you gave birth to or raised that you love your kid, what kind of care they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=332.3s)]
*  can get. He decides. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=337.7s)]
*  Care that, to be clear, the American Academy of Pediatrics supports and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=341.58s)]
*  recommends. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=346.38s)]
*  Think about what this means right now, as I'm speaking to you, their parents [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=349.3s)]
*  and families in Florida who have decided [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=352.54s)]
*  as a family, as parents, along with their doctors, that this health care, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=355.82s)]
*  gender affirming care, is the best care for their kids. You may not like it, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=360.42s)]
*  but you know what? It's none of your, excuse me, goddamn business. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  To me, that is what the courage to be free means. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=371.94s)]
*  Freedom means that in my household, our family decides what kind of health care [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=377.14s)]
*  our child does or does not get. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=384.14s)]
*  Not Ron DeSantis, not the Republican Party, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=388.42s)]
*  but that is no longer the case in Florida. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=392.82s)]
*  I think this is something that we just made the decision as a state and me as [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=396.3s)]
*  governor to just say, you know, we're protecting kids and we're going to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=401.74s)]
*  protect kids when it's popular. We'll protect kids even when you take some [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=405.7s)]
*  incoming as a result of maybe offending some ideologies or some agendas out [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=410.98s)]
*  there, but that's fine. We're happy to do that because this is important. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=415.66s)]
*  They're happy to tell you whether you can get an abortion, whether you can [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=420.66s)]
*  give birth or not. The government of Florida, Vyra Ron DeSantis, they made [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=424.62s)]
*  that decision for you. They made the decision about your child's health care. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=428.1s)]
*  They decided the kind of care your child can receive. Ron DeSantis probably [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=431.74s)]
*  knows pretty well, right? What's best for your 13-year-old, the one that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=435.46000000000004s)]
*  lives in your house? Their courts could decide to take that child away from you [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=439.46000000000004s)]
*  if you violate their rules, their ideology. As a parent, I cannot think of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=446.54s)]
*  anything more horrifying or un-American than that, and yet it is going to be the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=453.38s)]
*  centerpiece of Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMb2JnW3_H0&t=458.74s)]
