Video Description: Fulton County DA Fani Willis rebuked GOP Rep. Jim Jordan over his bid to interfere in the Trump case. “Your letter makes clear that you lack a basic understanding of the law,” Willis wrote. “For a more thorough understanding of Georgia’s RICO statute, its application and similar laws in other states, I encourage you to read ‘RICO State-by-State.’ As a non-member of the bar, you can purchase a copy for two hundred forty-nine dollars.”

# Georgia DA eviscerates Jim Jordan, suggests he buy book on RICO law
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI)
*  This afternoon, Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis published a letter responding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=0.0s)]
*  to Republican Congressman Jim Jordan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  He's now in the majority. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=7.8s)]
*  He's now the chair of the Republican so-called Weaponization Committee, who has tried on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=9.0s)]
*  multiple occasions now to run cover for Donald Trump by obstructing Willis's investigation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=13.66s)]
*  Willis writes, quote, Chairman Jordan, I tell people often, deal with reality or reality [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=20.76s)]
*  that will deal with you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=25.34s)]
*  Face this reality, Chairman Jordan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=27.14s)]
*  The select group of defendants who you fret over in my jurisdiction are like every other [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=29.14s)]
*  defendant entitled to no worse or better treatment than any other American citizen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=33.3s)]
*  For a more thorough understanding of Georgia's RICO statute, its application, and similar [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=38.34s)]
*  laws in other states, I encourage you to read RICO State by State. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=42.5s)]
*  As a non-member of the bar, you can purchase a copy for $249. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=46.82s)]
*  In addition to that letter to Jordan, D.A. Willis is taking new steps today to protect [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=51.46s)]
*  jurors from potentially violent Trump supporters. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=57.06s)]
*  As we've covered on this program before, the trial or trials of Trump and his 18 co-defendants [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=61.42s)]
*  in Atlanta will be televised and not because it's a Trump trial. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=65.34s)]
*  That's what happens in Georgia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=68.82s)]
*  And that, to my mind, is a good thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=71.58s)]
*  I mean, especially as voters consider whether or not the four times indicted ex-president [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=72.9s)]
*  should be sent back to the White House to finish the job he started on January 6th. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=76.94s)]
*  That said, D.A. Willis is understandably concerned about the safety of those jurors sitting in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=81.24s)]
*  that jury box that you see there over the attorney's right shoulder, those jurors who [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=85.56s)]
*  will determine the fate of the ex-president and his confederates. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=89.8s)]
*  Today in a legal motion, she asked Judge Scott McAfee to bar the press from publishing any [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=93.8s)]
*  information about prospective jurors, including images, video, or court sketches. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=98.8s)]
*  It's not an abstract concern. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=104.24s)]
*  As D.A. Willis notes in the motion, personal information about the grand jurors who voted [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  to indict Trump was shared online with the obvious intention to encourage harassment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=110.14s)]
*  Willis herself has been doxxed, received racist death threats as a result, and we know Donald [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=115.94s)]
*  Trump cultivates intimidation and menace as a routine part of his political agenda, as [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=120.66s)]
*  a tool he wields. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=124.48s)]
*  In fact, part of the Georgia-Rico indictment deals specifically with the harassment of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=125.9s)]
*  two specific election workers who had angry Trump supporters showing up outside their [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=132.48s)]
*  home because their address got put on the Internet. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=137.3s)]
*  We may learn even more about that harassment tomorrow. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=141.3s)]
*  That's when the special grand jury report outlining Trump and his co-defendants alleged [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=144.36s)]
*  crimes is made public at 10 a.m. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=147.52s)]
*  That's not all we got out of Georgia today. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=151.24s)]
*  Trump's lawyers say they may request to move his trial to federal court. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=152.86s)]
*  And then speaking of federal court, after a month-long break, get this, this was surprising [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  to me when I saw this today, and I still don't know quite what's up with it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  We're going to try to find out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=164.74s)]
*  But Jack Smith's federal grand jury, the one that's looking into the attempted coup, the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=166.18s)]
*  one that indicted Donald Trump a few months ago, met again today to continue its investigation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=170.3s)]
*  There is no indication things are slowing down anytime soon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=177.66s)]
*  Medors Cordell served 19 years as a judge, including over a dozen on the Superior Court [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  of California. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=186.58s)]
*  She's author of Her Honor, My Life on the Bench. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=187.58s)]
*  Harry Lippman served as deputy assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=189.58s)]
*  He's now a legal affairs columnist for the Los Angeles Times, and both join me now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=193.9s)]
*  Judge Cordell, let me start with you on this juror question. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=198.26s)]
*  I read what District Attorney Willis had to say. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=201.82s)]
*  It seems eminently reasonable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=204.54s)]
*  I wonder how much is this standard practice in a high-profile case? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=206.22s)]
*  How much is this a sort of extra-prophylactic measure, given the context of what we've seen [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=209.94s)]
*  before, and particularly Trump supporters? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=214.18s)]
*  Well, Chris, the first anonymous jury in this country was impaneled in 1977 in New York [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  City. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=224.62s)]
*  It was the trial of Leroy Barnes, and he was a drug kingpin. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=225.62s)]
*  And it was an anonymous jury because his network was such that they were concerned about jury [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  tampering, intimidation, violence. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=235.82s)]
*  This man was charged with all manner of drug crimes, as well as a number of murders. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=238.94s)]
*  So that's where we had an anonymous jury. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  That's where it started. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=249.86s)]
*  And it became very common in the 1990s. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=251.34s)]
*  A more recent high-profile case was the case of George Zimmerman, who was charged with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=253.74s)]
*  the murder of Trayvon Martin. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=259.66s)]
*  That was an anonymous jury, again, because of concerns. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=261.94s)]
*  There were protests going on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=265.38s)]
*  So to have an anonymous jury in the case in Fulton County, it's not only appropriate, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=268.18s)]
*  it should be required. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=276.26s)]
*  We know that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=277.82s)]
*  We know what's going to happen. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=279.06s)]
*  What's going to happen is what happened to the grand jurors whose personal information [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=280.62s)]
*  got out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  So we already know what's going to happen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  I think the judge is required to do it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  And I do want to note that in the Trayvon Martin trial, the trial of George Zimmerman, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  the jury was actually sequestered during deliberations. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's highly likely that that's going to happen in the case in Fulton County. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that seems eminently sensible to me as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  I want to ask about the noises coming from Trump's attorneys, Harry, about this venue [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=306.7s)]
*  or not venue change, but it would be moving this case into federal court. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  And here's what I want to ask you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=318.18s)]
*  So they're saying they might do it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=319.3s)]
*  It seems to me, and again, the procedure here is complex and opaque and I don't know it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=321.58s)]
*  It seems to me that what's in their interest is to burn as many days as possible and wait [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  until the last minute to file that so you can push out the deadline of that and everything [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=331.1s)]
*  has to go on and on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=334.1s)]
*  Is there some drop dead date that they have to say whether they're going to do that or [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=335.94s)]
*  not or can they just burn up time until they're forced to? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=340.26s)]
*  There's a drop dead date. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  It's 30 days after he's been arraigned, which was August 31st. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=346.46s)]
*  So it's September 30th. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=350.38s)]
*  And I think we've always known he was going to go to the very end. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=351.38s)]
*  Just as you say, any any hour of a delay is a good hour for Trump. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=354.74s)]
*  So it's a foregone conclusion, I think. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=360.22s)]
*  And we said this up front. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=362.7s)]
*  He would do it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=364.22s)]
*  He would do it at the end of 30 days. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=365.22s)]
*  His prospects are very, very poor. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=367.26s)]
*  It's of a piece with what's going on with Mark Meadows, what happened with Trump previously [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=370.1s)]
*  about trying to show executive privilege. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=376.1s)]
*  That is, is he in the conduct alleged acting within the scope of his official duties as [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=378.94s)]
*  president? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=385.9s)]
*  You know, fomenting a coup is nowhere in Article two. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=386.94s)]
*  I think they will make quick work of it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=390.62s)]
*  He'll be able. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=392.82s)]
*  These motions provide for automatic right of appeal. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=394.02s)]
*  So it'll go up to the 11th Circuit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=397.38s)]
*  But we have to hope that they'll make quick work of it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=399.38s)]
*  But remember, Judge McAfee talked about that even at the hearing as perhaps a matter of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=402.26s)]
*  months. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=407.5s)]
*  So that's something he's been planning on burning from the start, starting with this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=408.5s)]
*  first 30 days. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=412.02s)]
*  Yeah, and I got to say, again, from my perspective, you know, Meadows even has a more plausible [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=413.58s)]
*  claim to me if he's saying I was I was subordinate on the chief of staff. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=419.06s)]
*  I do this than the guy who was actually engineering the whole thing, who obviously can almost [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=422.34s)]
*  by definition be acting as an official capacity to undo an American election. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=426.58s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=432.5s)]
*  Meadows is the only guy who has, I think, a colorable claim. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=433.5s)]
*  The other three who have tried it, Georgia electors, Willis said, sort of very [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=437.02s)]
*  puckishly, they were just masquerading. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=443.06s)]
*  Anyway, there's no federal role they have when they're showing a fake marshals badge. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=445.7s)]
*  And so I think it's Meadows and Meadows only. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=449.94s)]
*  And then the question of who goes over with him, that's an unsettled question in Georgia [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=452.7s)]
*  law. Yeah, but I think I think Trump is DOA, but of course, he'll do it and play out the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=457.26s)]
*  appeal, probably petition for cert even. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=462.14s)]
*  But this is this is a claim that I think goes nowhere. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGAKIL3xtLI&t=465.46s)]
