# Cy Vance on the expected Trump delay tactics following his indictment
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ)
*  If the ex-president follows his usual strategy of delay, delay, delay to postpone his federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  criminal trial in Florida, one of the people who has first-hand knowledge of Donald Trump's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=4.4s)]
*  tactics is former Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who began investigating Trump and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=8.0s)]
*  his family company back in 2018. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  When Vance's office issued a subpoena for Trump's personal and corporate taxes, Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=16.4s)]
*  filed suit to block it, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court twice. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=21.1s)]
*  It took 18 months before Vance finally got the tax records. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=25.6s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled in his office's favor. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=28.96s)]
*  And just over four months after that, relatively quickly, he charged the Trump Organization [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=31.76s)]
*  with running a 15-years-long tax scheme. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=35.84s)]
*  Ultimately, the investigation that Vance launched led to his successor, Alvin Bragg, securing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=38.8s)]
*  a tax fraud conviction against the Trump Organization in criminal court, along with a guilty plea [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=42.92s)]
*  from its former CFO, that man, Allen Weisselberg, and most significantly, as we know, a 34-count [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=48.6s)]
*  felony indictment of the ex-president just two months ago in Manhattan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=54.8s)]
*  That happened nearly five years after Cy Vance began his investigation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=59.2s)]
*  Cy Vance, a district attorney from Manhattan from 2010 to 2022, joins me now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=63.92s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=67.92s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=68.72s)]
*  First, just maybe a little bit of your experience with that drawn-out litigation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=69.92s)]
*  Obviously, in that case, there are some interestingly novel issues, I suppose, although [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=73.28s)]
*  in the end, the Supreme Court said, not really, sort of is like anyone else. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=78.16s)]
*  But what do you anticipate in terms of the success of delay tactics and even sort of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  basic things like that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=90.56s)]
*  Well, our case was in a unique set of circumstances because President Trump was President Trump. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=92.64s)]
*  Sitting president, yes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=98.16s)]
*  And when you're the sitting president, I've discovered there are many guardrails in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=99.28s)]
*  system to protect you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  You can have, as he did, your attorney general oppose a subpoena in civil court. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=104.16s)]
*  You can have your solicitor general do the same. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=111.28s)]
*  You can have all the forces of the federal government is arguing his case was arguing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=113.2s)]
*  his case, including in addition to his private lawyers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=117.84s)]
*  And what I would say, those guardrails were frustrating, but I understood them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=121.68s)]
*  And I think they're important. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=127.68s)]
*  You have to protect the president from routine or not routine from malicious suits. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=129.52s)]
*  And in our case, interestingly, given the comments about politics being involved, the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=136.56s)]
*  Supreme Court looked at twice the court's rule. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=141.84s)]
*  There was no evidence of political motivation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=144.88s)]
*  And I think that's probably going to find the same in everything that's on today. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=147.04s)]
*  But it took a long time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=151.28s)]
*  But once we had the records and once we were able to get grand juries up and running because [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=153.44s)]
*  they were stopped under covid, it was a relatively quick process to present the indictment for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=157.76s)]
*  tax evidence. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  So my my sense is we were in somewhat unique and different circumstances than there are [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=164.4s)]
*  today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=169.28s)]
*  He no longer has that protection. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't have the Department of Justice. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  But I think I think the game plan for the defense is typically benefited by delay. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=172.0s)]
*  I mean, if your client is not in court, he can't go to jail. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=178.8s)]
*  So you and if he's not if he's not in jail, if he's not sitting in Rikers, then you want [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=181.76s)]
*  to delay as long as possible because he's free every day that he's not being. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  But in seriousness, I think the judges, as your earlier panelists suggest, I think the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=190.16s)]
*  judges will all try to move these cases as quickly as they can. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=197.04s)]
*  There are three different parallel running train tracks, civil in the AG's office in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=200.48s)]
*  New York, criminal now in the Manhattan DA's office in a new criminal case in Florida. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  And there may be more trains added or more tracks. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  But you just mentioned Letitia James, of course, the attorney general of the state of New York. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=215.44s)]
*  And she was speaking with my friend and colleague, Alex Wagner yesterday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=219.44s)]
*  And she talked about the sort of how this is going to work out jurisdictionally. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=222.24s)]
*  And here's what she had to say. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=225.84s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=226.72s)]
*  The special counsel has asked for a speedy trial for this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=228.96s)]
*  Is this going to intersect with your case at all? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=232.16s)]
*  How is everybody going to manage the calendar here? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=234.88s)]
*  So in all likelihood, I believe that my case as well as DA Bragg and the Georgia case [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=237.36s)]
*  will unfortunately have to be adjourned pending the outcome of the federal case. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=245.52s)]
*  So it all depends upon the scheduling of this particular case. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=251.68s)]
*  I didn't that was news to me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=257.36s)]
*  And again, this is not my area of expertise. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=262.16s)]
*  Well, it was news to me as a as a set rule. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=263.44s)]
*  I think the attorney general may be right in what ultimately transpires in terms of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=267.52s)]
*  the schedules as we were talking about a civil case would ordinarily be trumped in terms of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=272.72s)]
*  next stage to a criminal case. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  But having filed the Manhattan case first, even though it's only a matter of a month or two [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=281.6s)]
*  before the case in Florida, the Manhattan judge, John Roshan, excellent, serious, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  he's going to want his case to move. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's what all judges want. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=294.16s)]
*  And so presumably will the Florida judge. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  I think there will probably be communications amongst and between the judges, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=297.92s)]
*  as well as probably amongst and between the attorneys representing the parties. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=301.68s)]
*  But as a general proposition, I think the odds are good that Florida will go first. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=307.2s)]
*  You do. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=313.04s)]
*  And you think that's because of a sort of again, there's not like some guidelines here. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=313.76s)]
*  There's no like black letter. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=317.36s)]
*  It's no rule. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=319.04s)]
*  Regulation or rule, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=319.52s)]
*  It's just that the judges get on the phone with each other. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=320.64s)]
*  Well, I would I would hope so. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=323.6s)]
*  I mean, there's two judges. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=325.52s)]
*  They got two different. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=326.24s)]
*  They got two different cases with the most, you know, strange and famous defendant in, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, the country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  You have two different judicial systems, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=334.56s)]
*  Entirely separate and with their own statutory authority. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=336.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=340.24s)]
*  So I would assume that representatives of the New York State Court and the federal [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=340.64s)]
*  court would have conversations, nothing improper about that, about scheduling. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=345.76s)]
*  And there would be input, no doubt, from the parties. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=350.4s)]
*  So I think this will probably be a civil and that I mean, courteous process. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  Judge Bershaw is not going to want to be treated as a second class citizen and shouldn't be. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=358.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  Nor should Judge Bershaw not recognize that the stakes in the Florida case are about as high as [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  they get and that we all should want that case to move appropriately and fairly. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=368.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think it's a little bit up in the air, but I'd give I'd give the edge to the federal case. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMwe25lRpsQ&t=378.64000000000004s)]
