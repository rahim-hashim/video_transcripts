# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We've got a big development today in a case that's fallen off the radar over the past few months [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Special Counsel Jack Smith's federal election interference case against Donald Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=6.0s)]
*  Even as the ex-president tries to wriggle and bully his way out of accountability for his various misdeeds, to lash out at the judge and their prosecutors [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=11.0s)]
*  The special counsel's office is looking to bring some justice and hold Trump accountable for attempting to overthrow the 2020 election [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=19.0s)]
*  By making the insurrection the key focus of their federal criminal case against him [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=26.0s)]
*  Politically, I think, and I don't think I'm saying anything profound here, that's not great for Trump [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=31.0s)]
*  I mean, remember, January 6th was both the lowest point of his presidency in substantively, in moral terms, and also politically in terms of popular opinion [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=38.0s)]
*  And it looks like voters will be reminded of that dark moment in American history in the lead up to next year's election [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=48.0s)]
*  Because right now it is not exactly front of mind for voters [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=55.0s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump in general is not exactly front of mind for voters. His strategy, whether intentional or not, I think he sort of backed into it since he left office [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=59.0s)]
*  Has been to kind of silo himself off in a MAGA bubble [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=67.0s)]
*  The people around Donald Trump understand that he is unpopular, that the more voters see of him, the less they like him [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=73.0s)]
*  He's no longer on Twitter or X or whatever the heck it's called these days. Instead he just preaches to the choir on his own social media platform [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=80.0s)]
*  He is increasingly unhinged rallies, and not just unhinged, he seems confused, he warned about us starting World War II [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=88.0s)]
*  Those are really only carried live by the most diehard MAGA networks, so a lot of people aren't seeing those [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=96.0s)]
*  He skipped last night's Republican primary debate, like he skipped the two that came before it, so people aren't seeing him there [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=102.0s)]
*  Of course, in that time, Trump's only increased his lead over the Republican primary field without ever showing up, so why would he show up? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=108.0s)]
*  Republican primary voters want Trump, and they are keyed in to his closed off media ecosystem [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=116.0s)]
*  I don't think the same can be said for the average American voter, though [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=122.0s)]
*  The news cycle has crowded Trump out a bit, particularly in the wake of the war in the Middle East [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=126.0s)]
*  But in the background, day by day, we are heading towards what will be one of the most consequential trials in American history [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=131.0s)]
*  And the biggest political event in memory, the sustained criminal litigation of Donald Trump's role in the attempted coup [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=139.0s)]
*  To that end, today, we have new reporting that gives us an idea of how Donald Trump might face justice for the most egregious of his crimes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=146.0s)]
*  According to a new court filing, Smith's prosecutors are looking to make the case that Trump's various criminal conspiracies to overturn the 2020 election [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=155.0s)]
*  Quote, culminated and converged when on January 6th, the defendant attempted to obstruct and prevent the congressional certification at the Capitol [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=163.0s)]
*  As my next guest reports, Smith's office is effectively casting quote, effectively quote, casting Trump as one of the 1200 plus riot defendants who have already been charged [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=171.0s)]
*  In other words, when Donald Trump goes to trial next year, he will be treated the same as the hundreds and hundreds of violent rioters who stormed the Capitol, assaulted police officers, and tried to overthrow the results of a free and fair election [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=181.0s)]
*  According to the filing, Smith's team seeks to highlight the actions of those rioters, the jury, through quote, testimony, video, photographic, and geolocation evidence [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=193.0s)]
*  Establishing that many of Trump's supporters responded to his direction on January 6th [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=202.0s)]
*  That's right, testimony. So Smith's team is apparently planning on having some January 6th insurrectionists testify against Trump at trial to make the case that yes, it was that guy, obviously [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=207.0s)]
*  The ex-president, the one whose name was like emblazoned on all our hats and on all our signs and all our gear and who told us to go to the Capitol, remember that guy? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=220.0s)]
*  The guy who's there sitting at the defendant's table in the trial? That guy is the one responsible for the riot. That's the guy that convinced me, us, to storm the Capitol through his words and actions [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=229.0s)]
*  So next year, when Donald Trump goes to trial, just one day, one day before Super Tuesday primary, if Jack Smith gets his way, jurors, by extension voters, will not only be reminded of the lengths Donald Trump will go to in order to end American democracy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=241.0s)]
*  They will be told that he is no different from the hundreds of people already found guilty for their role in his attempted coup [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=256.0s)]
*  Kyle Cheney is the senior legal affairs reporter for Politico who reported on Jack Smith's court filing and he joins me now [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=263.0s)]
*  Kyle, first just give us, this is all working off of a filing from the prosecutor, special prosecutor's office. What is the filing, why did it have to be filed, and what does it say? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=270.0s)]
*  Sure, so to everything you just said, Donald Trump has basically argued, Jack Smith, his team, they shouldn't even mention the riot at this trial, in their filing, it's in the indictment kind of glancingly, they said we should strike that out of the indictment because I'm not charged with anything to do with the violence that occurred at the Capitol [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=280.0s)]
*  And there was a reasonable argument that maybe Jack Smith wasn't going to feature that at the trial, but Jack Smith, he gave that famous opening statement where he referenced the violence and then we weren't sure what's going to happen with that in the course of these proceedings [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=298.0s)]
*  Well, Jack Smith did tip his hand, he said, not only are we going to mention the violence at trial, we are going to focus on it, we are going to make it a feature of this trial where we are going to show what occurred there, the danger, the threat to democracy, the violence, the attacks on police [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=311.0s)]
*  That was the kind of thing that the courts were inspired by, stoked by, and sort of allowed to occur by Donald Trump himself [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=324.0s)]
*  So it's filings back and forth about what can and cannot be addressed in court, right? And I want to read from your piece here, the description of the case he plans to lay out was a response to Trump's demand that U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chuchkin strike references to the January 6th riot from the language of the indictment [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=330.0s)]
*  Arguing the charges against him aren't related to the riot, they reference the attack where inflammatory surplusage intended to stir the passions of prospective jurors [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=347.0s)]
*  So this is the first time where we have a deferment of argument publicly made in a court filing by Smith's office that says yes, what happened on that day, the violence of that day, the people that were there on that day, those are intimate parts of the case we are going to bring against the defendant [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=356.0s)]
*  Right, this is not just some sort of ancillary part of the story, this is the story, this is Donald Trump used, not only did he sort of stoke the riot and then flame it further by attacking Mike Pence while the violence was going on, he used it to try to continue to obstruct the January 6th session of Congress [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=371.0s)]
*  He knew what was going on, he didn't intervene, and then he actually tried, you know, used that time to try to call all their senators, call members of Congress to continue to try to delay the certification of Biden's victory [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=387.0s)]
*  And one of the things, you know, there's a debate when we were getting reporting about Jack Smith working on this indictment, whether he would be charged with incitement or insurrection or one of those, right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=397.0s)]
*  He ultimately wasn't either of those, but the conspiracy to obstruct a potential proceeding, which hundreds of folks have actually either pleaded to or been convicted of, that's where they're making the legal case that like you can't separate that crime from what happened on that day [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=407.0s)]
*  Right, exactly, Donald Trump is charged with 1512C, that's the statute code of obstruction of an official proceeding, as you mentioned, hundreds of January 6th rioters charged with the same crime [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=423.0s)]
*  And what Jack Smith says in this filing is essentially they're charged for basically the same reason, and everything about the riot is central to that charge, whether it's against Donald Trump or against a guy who tried to break through the police lines that day [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=433.0s)]
*  It was sort of with the same goal in mind, and though they're not co-conspirators linked in the crime together, they essentially were operating in parallel [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=446.0s)]
*  Now, this filing comes as there's sort of an interesting thing developing where Judge Chutkin has kept things on schedule for that March trial date [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=453.0s)]
*  She's given some latitude to Trump in filings for other motions around different things, there's been contestation of her protective order, there's been some other sort of briefing that's happening [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=461.0s)]
*  But that stuff, as I understand it now, is parallel to a trial schedule that essentially remains locked in for now, at least [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=471.0s)]
*  Yes, Judge Chutkin has made one thing clear, that March 4th trial date, that is not moving, it would take something extraordinary for her to move that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=481.0s)]
*  She has said it will not yield to the election calendar, which, you know, to Trump's frustration and to his lawyer's frustration [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=488.0s)]
*  They keep saying, you know, we should just push everything back a little bit, just give us more time, and she's saying, you know, I'll give you a little time within the window between now and March 4th, but not going to move that ultimate date [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=494.0s)]
*  All right, Kyle Cheney with that reporting on the briefing that came from the special prosecutor's office for Politico, thanks a lot, appreciate it [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=505.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, New York magazine writer at large, Rebecca Traister, wrote this big cover story about the emerging politics of abortion after the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Roe v. Wade [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=512.0s)]
*  At the time, there was still some debate around her hypothesis that abortion wins elections for Democrats who were entering, quote, a new era of political possibility [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=523.0s)]
*  But now, particularly after the wins for abortion rights that we saw this week, it's clear Rebecca Traister was correct, and I think both parties understand that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=532.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Rebecca Traister, it's great to have you on the program, it's always nice to write something and then have it borne out by subsequent events [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=541.0s)]
*  Did you anticipate that things would be as, at least as of now, unequivocal politically as they have proven to be so far? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=550.0s)]
*  No, in fact, you know, I was nervous about the blunt force of the headline of that story, which was simply, abortion wins elections [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=559.0s)]
*  Because, of course, I understand as a voter, as a political writer, as somebody who's looked at this history, that very rarely is there anything that is quite so unequivocal [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=570.0s)]
*  And that headline really was a blunt force headline. And of course, you never know actually what's going to happen in any given election [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=580.0s)]
*  But here we are, there have been these seven referendum votes in addition to Supreme Court votes in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that have relied on abortion [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=587.0s)]
*  There's been the vote in Ohio about whether one could vote in the referendum on Tuesday [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=598.0s)]
*  There have been all these elections, and yes, in every case over the past, in the months since I published that story, and in fact since Dobbs [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=603.0s)]
*  In almost every contest, abortion has won. But I have to say that I think that that blunt force headline was necessary to get through to a Democratic party that over decades [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=610.0s)]
*  Hasn't always felt comfortable running on abortion rights, has treated it as a difficult and controversial issue rather than a very popular issue, which is one of its strengths [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=624.0s)]
*  And so that blunt force headline, abortion wins elections, was meant to get in the head of Democrats [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=637.0s)]
*  And as you pointed out earlier, now we have all this evidence, and it is very much in the head of Democrats and Republicans [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=642.0s)]
*  And you detailed some of the challenges ahead for Republicans. How do they, the you broke it, you bought it problem for Republicans, which is they got what they wanted, which is the overturn of Roe [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=648.0s)]
*  And now they are paying for it in these steady electoral losses, and what are they going to do? On the other side of that is the question of what Democrats are going to do [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=658.0s)]
*  Because maybe the bluntness of that equation is getting through, but I think especially going into the 2024 elections, one of the things they have to think about is [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=667.0s)]
*  Okay, so abortion may win elections, but you actually have to think about why it's winning. You can't just say the word abortion. It took a long time for a lot of Democratic politicians to even be able to utter the word abortion [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=676.0s)]
*  And now they're going to get better at that, but you can't just say the word over and over and over again without thinking what is it here that is driving voters to the polls in this sort of like undeniable surge of Democratic support [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=688.0s)]
*  What are voters responding to here and really think that through in terms of how they communicate moving into this next year and in fact into the years that are to come? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=704.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's a really good point. I think part of what's so interesting, particularly if you look at Ohio, for instance, I mean, it's very tangible and concrete [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=713.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's not sometimes things in politics are very attenuated. You're voting for this person and you hope when you put them in they'll vote the way you want and then maybe they'll pass the tax code or whatever [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=722.0s)]
*  This is like it's the you're going to be able to get an abortion Ohio or not. Like that's very clear. The question on the federal level, which I think is, you know, to play this out, the Republicans are clearly they have no idea what to do [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=732.0s)]
*  And they're fighting about national women. But it does seem to me like the clear message here is for the Democrats at the federal level in the presidential election is we will vote to protect abortion nationwide [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=744.0s)]
*  They say Cata Fowler-Roe, which I think is a sort of not a great phrase. I think we should come up with something else. But that seems to me like the clear message here is we will protect abortion rights nationwide [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=755.0s)]
*  Right. And I think that has to be there. There has to be an exchange. As you point out, these referenda have put voters closer to actual policymaking. Then then we get to be in a lot of the in a lot of electoral instances, right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=768.0s)]
*  And that you go and you know that your vote counts toward protecting a right to access health care. Right. That is an incredible power, incredibly powerful and motivating feeling. And your point as to what has to happen on the federal level and the argument and the deal that politicians have to put out there for the voters who they want to come vote for them a year from now is your vote is again going to matter when it comes to the reinstatement or protection. And and part of what my story was about in March was that the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=782.0s)]
*  part of what I was talking about in March is that there is not a history of politicians being able to do this legislatively. The Supreme Court decision in Roe in 1973 came at just the moment that there was even the beginning of discussion about a federal legislative project to protect and decriminalize abortion. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=812.0s)]
*  And so democratic politicians on a federal level have a lot of work to do right now to think about how they're going to make this policy. That's such an important point and a key point in how you're going to message and then deliver. You know, if you win in this run up the election, how you make this, you know, because it's going to be central in this election. And if you, you know, you can't just talk about it. You got to you got to have a plan for people. Rebecca Traster, whose piece is worth going back to if you have not yet read it. Always great to have you on. Thank you very much. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=831.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBx21hEkDHU&t=861.0s)]
