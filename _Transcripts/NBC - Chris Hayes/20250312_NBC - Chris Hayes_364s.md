# RFK Jr. promotes ‘MAHA fries’ as measles outbreak grows
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8)
*  Part of the whole make America healthy again shtick touted by Trump and RFK [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  jr. the campaign trail is that Americans need to have better food to eat which [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=4.24s)]
*  you know true absolutely and yet Trump's USDA just canceled two federal programs [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  that literally did just that programs that gave a billion dollars to schools [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  and food banks to buy food from local farms just a total win-win right kids [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  but get better food farmers get money and Trump just chucked it all away [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=24.48s)]
*  without a single solitary peep from his new secretary of health and human [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=28.8s)]
*  services so that's his old bag right well you see he was too busy basically [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=33.04s)]
*  cutting an ad for a fast-food restaurant that switched to cooking its fries and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=37.08s)]
*  beef tallow which RFK jr. says is healthier. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=41.88s)]
*  Steak and Shake just switched out and people are raving about these French [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=46.96s)]
*  fries today the best French fries in the world are in Europe I order them every [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  time I go to Belgium or France or anyplace else and the French fries here [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=54.88s)]
*  just don't taste right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=59.28s)]
*  Okay well thanks for that Mr. Secretary. While he's doing that the deadly measles [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=61.0s)]
*  outbreak was spreading. There have now been at least 280 cases of needles [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=66.36s)]
*  reported since the beginning of the year that's compared to 285 cases recorded in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=71.0s)]
*  all of 2024 and we should note that health officials in Texas warn the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  reported number of cases is likely a large undercount because many people [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=80.48s)]
*  aren't getting tested. The man in charge of American health when he's not [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=84.56s)]
*  chowing down on those delicious beef tallow fries keeps casting aspersions on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=89.36s)]
*  the measles vaccine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=94.36s)]
*  It used to be when you and I were kids everybody got [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=96.32s)]
*  measles and the measles gave you protective lifetime protection against [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=100.64s)]
*  measles infection the vaccine doesn't do that vaccine is effective for some [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  people for life but many people it wanes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=109.52s)]
*  Dr. Ashish Jha is the Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. He [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=113.0s)]
*  served as a White House COVID response coordinator under President Biden. Just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=116.32s)]
*  this week he penned an op-ed titled measles is back and a lot more people are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  at risk and he joins me now. It's good to have you Dr. Jha. I gotta say I thought I [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  was having like a stroke when I was listening to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  describe that because this was exactly what people would say about COVID. Oh [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=132.16s)]
*  well the way to get immunity is to get the disease but then my understanding is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=135.76s)]
*  that we figured out this very cool hack where you could get the immunity [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=139.48s)]
*  without getting the disease which is called vaccination which is the whole [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=143.64s)]
*  point like what what am I missing here? You're missing nothing Chris and first [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=147.48s)]
*  of all thanks for having me back. Look this is two year 200 years of medical [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=152.88s)]
*  progress we have figured out exactly that hack that we can get your immune [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=157.44s)]
*  system prepped and ready without having to get really really sick and Robert F. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Kennedy I think wants to bring us back to the 16th and 17th century when the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=167.88s)]
*  only way to do it was to rough it get infected have a lot of kids die but [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=172.72s)]
*  that's how we got population immunity in the past. We don't need to do that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=177.92s)]
*  anymore we've learned a lot. Yeah I mean this idea that we all got measles and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=181.46s)]
*  like how bad was it my understanding is pretty bad like a lot of like measles is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=185.4s)]
*  I mean this is I seem I'm sound insane saying this but measles is bad correct? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=189.88s)]
*  Correct so you know a lot of people ask me they say well you know humanity has [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=196.56s)]
*  survived for centuries without it what did we do without vaccines? I'll tell you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=200.56s)]
*  what we did without vaccines we buried lots and lots of children. Yeah. There is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=204.12s)]
*  no reason to go back to that. Kids die of vaccine I'm sorry kids die of measles [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=208.8s)]
*  kids die because they get encephalitis. Vaccines are the one thing that really [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=214.24s)]
*  prevents measles. He also said in this interview which again I just found so [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=220.12s)]
*  both sort of distasteful and also wrong was like well healthy people don't die [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=224.72s)]
*  of measles and you know there's a food desert in West Tech which again like I [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=231.16s)]
*  don't know if there's a food desert or not I think the Mennonites are probably [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=234.92s)]
*  eating pretty healthy to be totally honest where this outbreak happened but [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  that's neither here nor there but like all that just seems completely not the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=240.92s)]
*  point about what's happening here but they're like the level of the health of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=244.64s)]
*  these kids as the determinative factor of this the problem with measles. Yeah so [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=248.04s)]
*  this is part of a long-standing campaign Chris. Obviously we all agree eating [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=257.24s)]
*  healthy exercise those are good things to do. One of the things that the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=262.88s)]
*  anti-vaccine crowd has done is blamed all of these illnesses on anything but [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=266.92s)]
*  the lack of vaccination. Right. The Mennonites actually are well-nourished [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=273.28s)]
*  they're not lacking in access to good food. Kids who are healthy and well [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=277.08s)]
*  nourished get very sick from measles. Yes. This is all a distraction we've got to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  focus on what matters which is building up immunity and the safe way to do that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=287.55999999999995s)]
*  is through vaccines. You worked in the upper levels of the American public [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  health bureaucracy in a moment of very important and difficult calls to make. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  Does it matter that the top health official sounds like this and like does [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=300.56s)]
*  it or does it not? Are people gonna do what they're gonna do independent of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=306.24s)]
*  what he's saying? Oh it matters enormously and this is why previous health [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=309.96s)]
*  secretaries of Republican and Democratic administrations have leaned in heavily [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=315.76s)]
*  towards what the scientists at the FDA and CDC are saying. They have not held [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=320.68s)]
*  their own idiosyncratic views. By the way that has been a bipartisan tradition [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=325.52s)]
*  in our country. RFK breaks that tradition and brings views into the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=330.12s)]
*  conversation that confuse people and when you confuse people you see what is [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=335.64s)]
*  happening in West Texas and elsewhere across the country. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=340.4s)]
*  you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_z3NRd_CZ8&t=360.08s)]
