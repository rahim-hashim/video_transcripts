# ‘Lawlessness’: Hayes on the ‘terrifying’ abuse of power at Trump’s EPA, FBI
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I)
*  Obviously, it's hard to keep track of the Trump administration's lawlessness. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=0.0s)]
*  It's my job to follow it, and frankly, I'm overwhelmed. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=3.44s)]
*  That said, a few specific instances really do stand out. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Probably the most chilling single act, of course, was the seizing of a lawful permanent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=10.0s)]
*  U.S. resident without charging with a crime or even saying he did anything wrong other [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=14.92s)]
*  than exercising his protected political speech. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=19.2s)]
*  It's an awful weaponization of the tools of the state, and it's not the only weaponization [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=22.04s)]
*  of that system. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=27.96s)]
*  Now, Trump's FBI is trying to, and you read that right, criminalize groups like Habitat [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=28.96s)]
*  for Humanity for receiving grants from the EPA under President Biden. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=35.28s)]
*  So here's how this works. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=39.64s)]
*  The story revolves around $20 billion in grants for clean energy programs. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=40.64s)]
*  It was issued to eight nonprofits through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=45.2s)]
*  seeded with money by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in both houses, signed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=49.36s)]
*  by the president. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=53.68s)]
*  It's a law, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=55.06s)]
*  Those groups got the money from federal grants and then set to lend out those funds to communities [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=56.76s)]
*  and businesses for energy improvement projects. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=61.28s)]
*  The money was for small loans, so stuff like weatherizing an office building or a home, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=64.36s)]
*  making it more energy efficient. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=69.08s)]
*  But then Trump's EPA chief, former Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin, pushed a right-wing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  conspiracy theory that grants were a giveaway to far-left political groups. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=76.24s)]
*  He claimed Biden officials somehow broke the law in dispersing the funds to Citibank to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=80.28s)]
*  give to the nonprofits. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=84.92s)]
*  And who wouldn't be suspicious of the groups who got this money? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=86.84s)]
*  Groups that not only include Habitat for Humanity International, but also the United Way worldwide. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=89.8s)]
*  Yes, that United Way from the football commercials, as well as Apalachic Coal and Energy Communities [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=96.16s)]
*  and Underserved America LLC, which serves communities that voted overwhelmingly for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=102.7s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=106.8s)]
*  And of course, that notorious hotbed of dangerous far-left radicalism, the New York State Department [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=107.8s)]
*  of Taxation and Finance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=113.8s)]
*  Okay, so Zeldin is accusing all of these groups of engaging in fraud. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=116.16s)]
*  He promised to claw back the money, but to be clear, it wasn't his money. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=121.56s)]
*  It was in their bank accounts at Citibank, and he had no legal way of doing it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=125.28s)]
*  It wasn't his. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=130.16s)]
*  So Trump's interim U.S. attorney for D.C., former Jan 6 defense lawyer Ed Martin, asked [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  the top prosecutor in his office, a career prosecutor, to open a criminal investigation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=138.32s)]
*  of these groups and seize the funds. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=143.44s)]
*  And you know what she did? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=145.24s)]
*  She refused, and she resigned instead. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=146.64s)]
*  And she said in her resignation letter, there was no evidence of a crime, which is plainly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=149.04s)]
*  true. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=153.24s)]
*  Then Martin personally submitted a seizure warrant application for the money, without [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=154.48s)]
*  any other prosecutors in his office, presumably because no one would sign on to it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=159.02s)]
*  And get this, a magistrate judge, the kinds of people that review these warrants all the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=163.24s)]
*  time, rejected his application. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=167.44s)]
*  They basically never do this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=170.16s)]
*  They said there was no evidence of a crime. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=172.12s)]
*  And despite all that, somehow, clearly not legally, in my humble estimation, the funds [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=174.76s)]
*  were frozen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=179.56s)]
*  Court filings show Citibank froze the money at the FBI's request, and FBI said the funds [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=181.08s)]
*  were subject to an ongoing criminal investigation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=185.84s)]
*  They sent letters to Citibank saying, you should freeze these accounts. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=188.4s)]
*  So several of the nonprofits are now suing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=192.72s)]
*  A federal judge in that case, Tanya Chutkin, sounded pretty skeptical of the government's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  arguments in court this week, telling a Trump administration lawyer, quote, you can't even [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=199.18s)]
*  tell me what the evidence of malfeasance is. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=202.68s)]
*  She ordered them to show the court evidence for their claims of fraud by Monday. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  Now, however those lawsuits shake out, think about this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  The Justice Department and the FBI have already committed a monumental abuse of power. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=214.46s)]
*  OK? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  We're now living in America where Trump's top FBI officials, Cash Patel, oh, and Dan [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=220.82000000000002s)]
*  Bongino, can move to unilaterally freeze a bank account they want with a letter, doctor [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=225.78s)]
*  up a criminal investigation to justify it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEjrQl6_H3I&t=232.17999999999998s)]
