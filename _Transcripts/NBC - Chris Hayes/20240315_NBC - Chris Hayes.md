Video Description: Catherine Christian and Charles Coleman join Chris Hayes to discuss the ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on the Trump Georgia case, the reason for the delay in the Trump hush money case, and more. “The fact that the U.S. Attorney's Office waited until this point to deliver such a massive document dump leaves the judge in this case basically with their hands tied,” says Coleman.

# ‘Shocking’ Trump hush money trial delay explained by ex-Manhattan prosecutor
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0)
*  A lot of big news today on two of Donald Trump's upcoming trials. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=0.0s)]
*  In New York, the judge in Trump's hush money election interference trial adjourned the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=4.46s)]
*  case for at least 30 days, following an influx of new discovery material. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  In Fulton County, Georgia, one of the prosecutors making the case against the ex-president stepped [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=13.86s)]
*  down, that would be Nathan Wade, who resigned as a condition of the case going forward. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=19.34s)]
*  This follows a failed attempt to have the case effectively dismissed after it was revealed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  that Wade had a romantic relationship with the district attorney leading the case, Fonny [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=29.56s)]
*  Willis. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=33.56s)]
*  So today, the judge came out with his ruling. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=34.56s)]
*  He did not destroy the case. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  He didn't nuke it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=37.96s)]
*  He didn't order Willis off the case, which was a possibility which would have ended the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=38.96s)]
*  prosecution. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=42.0s)]
*  Instead, the judge said the case could proceed, but ruled that either Wade or Willis would [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=43.0s)]
*  have to step aside. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=48.16s)]
*  Willis is staying on the case. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=49.84s)]
*  Even as this hurdle is cleared, there are a number of open questions about the timing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=52.44s)]
*  of this case going forward and the potential for further appeals. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=55.0s)]
*  Katherine Christian is a former prosecutor who served in the Manhattan District Attorney's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Office. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  Charles Coleman served as a prosecutor in New York and now practices as a civil rights [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  and criminal defense attorney, and they join me now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=66.24s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=68.6s)]
*  Let me start with you, Katherine, on the judge's order out of Fulton County today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  Judge McAfee, they had the sort of trial within a trial to see if the defense attorneys could [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=75.68s)]
*  meet a burden to show a conflict of interest between Fonny Willis and Nathan Wade that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=81.32s)]
*  would impinge or disqualify her from the case. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=86.36s)]
*  What did you think of his ruling? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=89.27999999999999s)]
*  I think that his decision was right on target. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  The standard should have been an actual conflict of interest. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  If you recall, during the hearing, the defense attorney says, no, it's an appearance of impropriety. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  And I've always said if that was the standard, there'd be a lot of elected DAs throughout [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  this country disqualified. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=103.88s)]
*  Now he did find that there was a significant appearance of impropriety, and there was. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=105.88s)]
*  And it's a very stinging decision. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=110.32s)]
*  He said she testified in unprofessional manner that the lapse of judgment, you know, so she [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=114.12s)]
*  won because she's not disqualified, but it was very critical of her. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  And of course, Mr. Wade had to leave, which he should have a long time ago, quite frankly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  And as soon as they start a romantic relationship, as soon as the motion was filed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=131.6s)]
*  But she gets to keep the case. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=135.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one more follow-up to you is about pre-trial appeals of this decision. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=136.84s)]
*  Again, I know we're so in the weeds of this stuff, but because the pacing is so important, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=141.52s)]
*  typically something like this might be brought up post-conviction appeals. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=146.24s)]
*  Do they have any avenue to further delay now? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=149.4s)]
*  They may be able to take what's called an interlocker appeal, meaning you don't wait [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=150.96s)]
*  till after the verdict. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  This case is not getting tried before the election. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  Even without this, this was not going to be tried before the election. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=158.28s)]
*  But with the appeal, it's going to be next year or so. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=161.4s)]
*  And I would add to that, Chris, that we don't know whether there have been referrals made [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  to the Georgia State Bar around ethics or those considerations, because when you're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  talking about the legal professional ramifications of something like this, the standard around [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  the appearance of impropriety becomes much more relevant than in this context. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Whether you're tossed off for conflict of interest. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=183.16s)]
*  And so I fully expect that they will try to go after her and him, for that matter, in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=184.16s)]
*  a different venue, which would be more appropriate than where they did here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=189.92s)]
*  This is the finding here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=192.88s)]
*  The judge found there was no actual conflict brought about by the relationship without [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=193.88s)]
*  sufficient evidence. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=197.6s)]
*  The district attorney acquired a personal stake in the prosecution that her financial [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=198.6s)]
*  arrangements had any impact on the case, which is what she was arguing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=201.92s)]
*  The defendant's claim of an actual conflict must be denied. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  That was the finding there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=207.88s)]
*  Let's move to this Alvin Bragg craziness. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=209.28s)]
*  You were in that office, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  So it appears like they got a huge dump of discovery from the U.S. Southern District [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=213.68s)]
*  of New York federal prosecutor's office that has now delayed them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  What are the ramifications of this delay? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's a big ramification. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=226.48s)]
*  First of all, it's shocking that the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  of New York, knowing how big a case this is in terms of high profile, knowing that the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=233.56s)]
*  trial was on March 25th, would do this 30,000 page document dump this week, 15,000 more [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=237.84s)]
*  documents today. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=246.0s)]
*  It's not surprising that the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan DA's office [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=248.32s)]
*  do not have a warm and fuzzy relationship. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=253.48s)]
*  That was my experience years there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=256.0s)]
*  I think Alvin Bragg believed because he was a line assistant there years ago, they would [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=257.88s)]
*  treat him differently. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=261.56s)]
*  Robert Malkinthor was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=262.64s)]
*  didn't treat him differently. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=266.4s)]
*  So the problem is that the prosecutor in New York have very stringent discovery requirements. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=268.56s)]
*  They essentially have to give over everything in their file, with some exceptions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  They also have to show that they were diligent and made a good faith effort to get items [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=280.58s)]
*  from an office that's not in their possession control, the Southern District. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  Did they do that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  When they say, the prosecutors say that we asked for it and the Southern District declined, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=292.06s)]
*  did they just say, okay, or did they take it further? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=296.5s)]
*  And that's what the hearing is going to be about, the circumstances about the document [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=299.58s)]
*  dump. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=302.74s)]
*  So there's still an outstanding question about when and if this trial goes to court. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=303.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=307.7s)]
*  What we're looking at is this, what would have been the trial date is now going to be [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=308.7s)]
*  discussed around future planning and scheduling around the future of this case. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=312.34s)]
*  And so just to put this in perspective, OFD, which is open file discovery, which Catherine [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=316.5s)]
*  was just talking about, is something that as prosecutors, you know, particularly in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=320.18s)]
*  New York City and New York State, you know you have to deal with, you know that this [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=324.32s)]
*  is not a jurisdiction where you're fighting back and forth about what has to be turned [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  over. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=332.7s)]
*  It's pretty much an agreement between prosecutors and the defense bar. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=333.7s)]
*  Turn it all over. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=336.41999999999996s)]
*  And so Catherine is absolutely right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=338.42s)]
*  The fact that the U.S. Attorney's Office waited until this point to deliver such a massive [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  document dump leaves the judge in this case basically with their hands tied to say, look, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=346.82s)]
*  it's very, very difficult for me to deny a motion for additional time to go over voluminous [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=352.26s)]
*  amounts of discovery. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=357.98s)]
*  It's reasonable. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=359.34000000000003s)]
*  And so this is another example of Donald Trump getting assistance from outside of his own [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  legal team around moving these delays further and further. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=365.9s)]
*  It's really been remarkable to watch when you've taken the American justice system, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=370.06s)]
*  which operates often in the background of people's imagination or people who are touched [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=373.73999999999995s)]
*  by the system. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  And there's a lot of them out there because we have the largest, you know, mass incarceration [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  in the developed world. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  So people know it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  They're up against it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  But the version they're next to or adjacent to often doesn't look like this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  It does go very slowly. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=392.2s)]
*  But a lot of times it goes slowly while you're sitting in Rikers waiting for your court date [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=393.34s)]
*  and then you play. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=396.85999999999996s)]
*  And so the system that we've seen here is like this test. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  Like can the system actually subject the most powerful private citizen, one of them in the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=401.5s)]
*  entire country, to like the normal rule of law? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1aPSFYN_0&t=406.53999999999996s)]
