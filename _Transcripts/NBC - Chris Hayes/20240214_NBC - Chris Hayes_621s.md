# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Feb. 13
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o)
*  Donald Trump is very likely the Republican nominee for president, but he's more than just a candidate for office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=0.0s)]
*  He was actually the president before [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=5.04s)]
*  People seem to have weirdly blocked it out. Maybe because the whole thing was so traumatizing, but I assure you he was there [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=7.82s)]
*  He has an actual record in that record. He did everything in office as president to undermine NATO [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=13.92s)]
*  Falsely painting it as a kind of protection racket in which the members were not paying him enough tribute [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=20.46s)]
*  Trump even tried to get the US to leave the alliance it founded altogether according to multiple counts from people inside his administration [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=25.36s)]
*  He also did everything he could to encourage Russian aggression against NATO [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=33.72s)]
*  He famously sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies in public about Russian sabotage of the 2016 election [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=37.44s)]
*  In that context what he said this weekend was fully in line with his thinking though unhinged even by his standards [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=46.6s)]
*  And one of the presidents of a big country stood up said well, sir [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=53.68s)]
*  If we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said you didn't pay you're delinquent [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=57.96s)]
*  He said yes, let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=65.88s)]
*  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got a pain. You got to pay your bills [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=70.12s)]
*  Now first of all, it almost certainly didn't happen whenever he gives you like a yes, sir story [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=76.24s)]
*  But that aside I was a little surprised to see several major news outlets failed to cite an obviously relevant piece of context [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=81.08s)]
*  which is that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=88.08s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is desperate to reach a negotiated [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=89.12s)]
*  Settlement to steal a big chunk of Ukraine and is counting on the Republican Party in the US to essentially aid him by cutting off [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=91.72s)]
*  Aid to the beleaguered army of Ukraine, which is quite literally running out of ammunition [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=98.72s)]
*  You know who did point out that context? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=103.36s)]
*  President Biden in brief remarks today that called for funding Ukraine and blasted Trump's comments [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=105.48s)]
*  Can you imagine a former president United States saying that the whole world heard it [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=112.44s)]
*  The worst thing is he means it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=119.72s)]
*  No other president our history has ever bowed down to a Russian dictator [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=122.24s)]
*  Let me say this as clearly as I can I never will [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=126.8s)]
*  For God's sake it's dumb it's shameful. It's dangerous. It's un-american [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=131.32s)]
*  And of course Putin made an enormous investment in Trump personally one that has been paying enormous dividends [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  He personally authorized a Russian operation to support a quote mentally unstable Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election as the Guardian put it [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=141.72s)]
*  And now Trump effectively runs the Republican Party and is for all the world acting like a man who wants to continue [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  pleasing his patron Putin [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=156.48s)]
*  He is going to do what he can to not only destroy the NATO Alliance but to make Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression impossible and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=158.48s)]
*  Trump's comments are reverberating around the world sending Europeans into equal parts rage and panic [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  Here at home the Republican Party base is under Donald Trump's thumb [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=171.48s)]
*  The Senate just overwhelmingly passed a bill to send military aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=175.0s)]
*  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson says his Trumpy majority is probably not even going to take the bill up for a vote in Congress [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  Just think about the incentives Putin had in 2016 the lengths that he went to to help get Trump elected criminal sabotage of an American election [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  We've talked at length about how desperate Trump is to get back in the White House in hopes of eluding jail time and not you know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=197.32s)]
*  possibly dying in prison [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=203.64s)]
*  Think about the stakes for Putin now as his war drags on and he desperately wants to end it with a Russian victory [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  And he has this one figure in his pocket singing his tune to half of America's two-party system [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=211.12s)]
*  Which is to say Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin need each other with a coincidence of interests [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  They hope will be stronger than NATO stronger even than American democracy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=223.56s)]
*  Donald Trump has sort of been decomposing in front of our eyes for so long. It's hard to track the trajectory [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean he is after all the guy who talked about shining UV light inside people's orifices or alternately injecting bleach [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=238.76s)]
*  In order to cure them of Kovac he said that in public from the White House podium [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=246.24s)]
*  I rewatched that clip today and it drove home to me how all the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=250.82000000000002s)]
*  Stupidity insanity hostility of Donald Trump's term has been kind of sanded down to just goofy and a lot of people's remembrances [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Today in a column titled Trump is losing it New York Times opinion columnist [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=262.2s)]
*  Jamal Bowie compared Trump's feebleness to the breathless coverage of President Biden's age quote [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=266.62s)]
*  Biden may be unable to do the job at some point in the future [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=271.0s)]
*  Trump it seems to me already is one of those is a lot more concerning than the other [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=273.88s)]
*  And Jamal Bowie in New York Times opinion columnist joins me now Jamal [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  I like I like your column and one of the things this is a hobby horse of mine [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=282.32s)]
*  So I'll just write it for a moment, which is I do think that because people don't see him speak at length [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  Temporaneously much anymore. They've lost sight of how just how completely incoherent he sounds when he does [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=292.44s)]
*  No, I think that's right [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=299.52s)]
*  I think Trump's great one of the great political advantages is that when he's out of public view people just sort of like forget about him [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=300.52s)]
*  Yeah, and everything they don't like about him is sort of not not in their face [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  But if you just if you just like watch recent his recent appearances at rallies at public events and such [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=311.76s)]
*  He's incoherent and I believe it's something to call him. He speaks in gibberish and it's very striking to watch [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, say more about that because I also he is he's always been sort of one for tangents [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=325.88s)]
*  But it is it is notably harder to make your way through the logic of what he is saying [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=333.0s)]
*  And then it was even a few years ago. I find I [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=339.36s)]
*  Agree, there's one clip [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=343.48s)]
*  I watched of him attempting to explain a missile defense system and he goes from sort of like a relatively [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=345.28s)]
*  Cogin sort of like, you know [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=351.94s)]
*  We build these things for other countries into what took me a sec to really figure out what he was saying like a description [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=353.1s)]
*  Of how it works but in sort of the kind of elliptical [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=359.3s)]
*  Nonsensical Trump fashion it was it was very strange to watch and I imagine have I've been to my fair share of Trump rallies [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=364.42s)]
*  I imagine that in the moment, especially if you're there as a supporter [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=370.74s)]
*  It kind of flies over you [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=374.18s)]
*  But I have to imagine that someone who just doesn't really think much about Trump and you just plop them right there [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=376.34s)]
*  And you said try to make sense of this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  It would be hard and certainly if the current president brister is speaking in that manner, it would be a legitimate scandal [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=384.41999999999996s)]
*  There's also the fact that again, there's always a certain amount of incoherence baked in that it can be it's hard to gauge over time [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=393.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=400.58s)]
*  Part of this because I mean look when you look at Donald Trump from the 1990s [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=401.7s)]
*  It's clear right that he's aged considerably and that same is true of Joe Biden when you look at Joe Biden as a senator [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=405.14s)]
*  You know when he's 40 or 45 like he's much younger man and he speaks very differently [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=410.02s)]
*  considerably but but [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=415.36s)]
*  the trump saying nonsense and incoherent things has been such a [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=417.22s)]
*  Again, it's like so many things about him that seems baked in and thus unremarkable and then thus not a news story [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=422.18s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't know [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=429.3s)]
*  That's a real dynamic that is that dynamic and I find it troubling because as you mentioned earlier he was president [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  Yes, and and it seems it seems so strange to me that he is discussed [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=438.66s)]
*  So much coverage of him talks like essentially speculation, but no he was he was president of the united states for four years [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=442.98s)]
*  I remembered I saw it [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=449.86s)]
*  and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=452.26s)]
*  uh [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=453.22s)]
*  His nato riff over the weekend [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=454.74s)]
*  That would have been that would be troubling even for just a candidate [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=457.54s)]
*  But he he was president and he should know and and treating it as if it's like oh, that's just trump [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=461.06s)]
*  You know doing his thing [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=466.58s)]
*  It's my view is no that's not just trying to doing his thing. That's the former president of the united states [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=468.02s)]
*  Um demonstrating not even that he has like a different a difference of opinion with regards to nato [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=473.6s)]
*  But they doesn't understand what the thing is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=478.98s)]
*  Yes, I mean I think at at many basic levels [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=482.02s)]
*  He does not understand the most big things of health insurance [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=484.98s)]
*  What medicare is the difference between medicare and medicaid like basic things that you would expect a president [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=488.26s)]
*  But we also saw I mean to me the big thing that we've blocked out [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=493.86s)]
*  Is covid because we saw how that lack of knowledge curiosity [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=497.78s)]
*  that incoherence all came together in the response in the ludicrous things from the the saying from the um, uh, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=502.42s)]
*  You know the white house the inability to actually like process and make decisions about new information [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  To a tangible like effect in terms of how bad the response was and again [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=516.34s)]
*  That was where it all happened and it all happened before us, but I do think people have blocked it out [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=520.98s)]
*  Trump has gotten some kind of covid mulligan that oh, that's just yes who could have predicted the pandemic, but here's the thing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=526.74s)]
*  The job of presidency of the presidency is being prepared for crises [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=534.42s)]
*  That's that's all it is right. We've judged presidents historically over how they handle crises [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=539.3s)]
*  As you know, i'm someone who's very interested in 19th century history [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=545.22s)]
*  The reason we think of james bucannon as a failed president because he was met with the crisis [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=548.26s)]
*  Mounting secession talk and he failed to handle it or deal with it in a way that helped the country survive [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=553.6s)]
*  Donald trump faced a crisis and that's the job and he failed to handle it and so it's strange [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=560.5799999999999s)]
*  That so many americans and I think a lot of coverage has given him a mulligan as if it doesn't count [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=568.82s)]
*  No, this is precisely the thing that counts the most [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=574.9s)]
*  I could not agree more about this is a recurring theme [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=578.58s)]
*  We actually talked about on my podcast why is this happening this week with eric klinenberg? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=581.22s)]
*  Who's got a new book out about that year about 2020 and we're revisiting it [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=585.14s)]
*  Which again people have blocked out for totally understandable reasons of emotional health [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=589.46s)]
*  But but but speaking to that mulligan, I think it's really important to reexamine jim l bowie. Thank you very much [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0TXKLGUy4o&t=593.86s)]
