# All In with Chris Hayes - Dec. 22  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA)
*  Good afternoon from New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=6.92s)]
*  Thank you for joining us for a special two-hour, 4 p.m. edition of All In. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=7.92s)]
*  It's a little under an hour ago, the Supreme Court rejected a proposal from Special Counsel [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=12.08s)]
*  Jack Smith to accelerate a decision on Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  his federal election criminal interference case. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=23.54s)]
*  Now, the one sentence reply, the order from the Supreme Court reads, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=26.44s)]
*  The petition for writ of certiorari before judgment is denied. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=30.92s)]
*  In other words, we're not going to speed this through. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=34.32s)]
*  We're not touching it before it goes through the normal appeals process, which is the appellate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=38.04s)]
*  circuit court in D.C. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  That outcome is exactly what Special Counsel Smith was hoping to avoid, because the appeals [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  process could give Donald Trump ample time to further delay this case, which is, of course, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=49.32s)]
*  just a few months from now, the first week of March. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=55.68s)]
*  Trump may now try to delay the start of the trial until the calendar begins to encroach [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=60.04s)]
*  on next November's general election, at which point, if he's the nominee, the ex-president [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=64.16s)]
*  can then ask the court to put the case on pause until the presidential contest is decided. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=68.08s)]
*  And of course, should Trump win that election, the case would go away entirely, which is, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=73.2s)]
*  to be clear, and what we all understand, including the people on the Supreme Court, exactly what [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=77.32s)]
*  he wants. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=81.92s)]
*  Although, I have to say, it is still unknown if Trump will be allowed to meaningfully delay [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=82.92s)]
*  this trial. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=87.48s)]
*  And we should note, while the court granting what's called cert before judgment, this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=88.48s)]
*  sort of leapfrogging that Smith wanted to do, is historically very, very rare, under [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=91.88s)]
*  the Robert Supreme Court, it's been weirdly common. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=97.44s)]
*  I mean, Robert's Supreme Court has done this 19 times since 2019 alone, according to analysis [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  from Supreme Court expert Steve Vladeck, who has built a life's work studying this exact [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=107.16s)]
*  exact procedural wrinkle on everything from affirmative action to a whole bunch of COVID [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=112.72s)]
*  restriction cases to student debt relief. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=117.36s)]
*  They just reached in and said, no, we don't need to hear from the appellate court. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=119.96s)]
*  We want it now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  We want it now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=124.36s)]
*  Give it to us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=125.36s)]
*  But when it comes to the question of whether the man who tried to end American democracy [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=126.36s)]
*  should face trial before voters decide if they want to elect him to finish what he started, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  it appears for now the MAGA Supreme Court just doesn't appear to be in much of a rush. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=134.76s)]
*  Melissa Murray is a professor at the New York University School of Law. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=140.36s)]
*  Harry Lippman is a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=142.96s)]
*  Marcus Childress served as an investigator for the January 6th committee, and they join [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=146.28s)]
*  me now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=150.52s)]
*  So it's great to have all three of you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=151.52s)]
*  I got the news, and my first thought was like, how should I feel about this? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=152.52s)]
*  So of course I texted Kate, but I'll start with you, Melissa. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=156.24s)]
*  How should I feel? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=159.2s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=160.2s)]
*  Well, I'm a little surprised. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=161.2s)]
*  I mean, as you say, it's not uncommon for the Roberts court to grant cert before judgment. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=162.8s)]
*  They did so with the affirmative action case last year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=167.76s)]
*  The First Circuit had proceeded and decided the Harvard case, but the Fourth Circuit was [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  still waiting to decide the UNC case, but they took it up on cert anyway. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=173.92s)]
*  They also did the same thing with Biden versus Nebraska, the student loan case. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=178.12s)]
*  And there's a broader historical precedent for this as well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=182.0s)]
*  In the United States versus Nixon, the Supreme Court granted cert before judgment in order [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  to determine whether Richard Nixon had to comply with the request to turn over certain [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=189.2s)]
*  was a pending criminal trial of the Watergate burglars. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=194.96s)]
*  Here the same kind of equities are in balance. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=198.72s)]
*  It's not simply just a criminal trial that's going on here, but the fact of an election [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  and whether or not the American people deserve to know whether someone that they're voting [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=206.06s)]
*  for is able to stand trial on criminal charges. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  So it seems like they're really important issues at stake here, but the court kind of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=213.96s)]
*  slow-walked this a little bit. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  So, Harry, we know the normal procedure here is that there's a district court judgment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=220.64s)]
*  by Judge Tanya Chukin, who I thought wrote a very strong and persuasive judgment that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  says, look, no, you can't assert presidential immunity for actions that were a criminal [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=232.27999999999997s)]
*  and had nothing to do with your official office. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  You were working as a candidate to overthrow the Constitutional Republic. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=239.64s)]
*  It wasn't like you were overseeing some rulemaking in the Department of Labor, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  So that's persuasive, I think. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  It then gets appealed to the appellate court, D.C. Circuit. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=248.44s)]
*  Now they have moved quite quickly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=251.2s)]
*  So I guess my question to you is, Smith wanted to move even faster than that, but now it's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=253.72s)]
*  going to go through that appeals process. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=258.28s)]
*  So what's your thinking about what this signals for timing here? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=259.92s)]
*  For timing, I think it probably means maybe a 60-day or so delay, but I think you've just [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=264.52s)]
*  the pivotal fact, because that happened after Smith petitioned for judgment for certiorari [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=272.96s)]
*  before judgment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  And by the time it came up to the court, there was the prospect that the D.C. Circuit would [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  be moving very quickly. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  We already know they're going to have oral argument on this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=290.56s)]
*  January 9th will probably issue a decision very quickly thereafter. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=293.88s)]
*  And I think the court, it decided this, whether or not to do it very quickly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=298.4s)]
*  I think it's aware of the importance and the need for expedition. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=302.28s)]
*  But it said to itself, you know, we could have a fuller treatment by the D.C. Circuit [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=307.88s)]
*  in just a few weeks. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  I've written my share of cert memos as a clerk, and that's something they really care about, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=315.32s)]
*  having it full from the D.C. Circuit. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=320.64s)]
*  And you mentioned the MAGA Court, but this was unanimous without dissents. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=322.64s)]
*  So I think the nine who in general are eager to avoid polarized decisions and black eyes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=326.56s)]
*  coalesced around the idea, let's just wait a few weeks to have the benefit of the D.C. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=332.72s)]
*  Circuit opinion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=338.16s)]
*  And as for the point you make about ultimate timing, even if it delays things, even a couple [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=339.16s)]
*  months, we're nevertheless not on the threshold of November. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  I think they are very aware themselves of the calendar, witness that they jumped on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=347.92s)]
*  this when asked. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=352.32s)]
*  And so there, I think the effect is real, but not fatal. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=354.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=359.08s)]
*  So that's an important point. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=360.08s)]
*  Just sometimes cert petitions will come with dissents authored by any of the justices who [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=361.88s)]
*  can write separately and say, look, I think we should have taken this case. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  In this instance, we don't have that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=370.84s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=373.28s)]
*  There's no like public, like cert votes are not made public and you only need four to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=374.28s)]
*  grant cert. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=378.68s)]
*  You don't need a majority. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=380.2s)]
*  But so we don't know for sure, but we know that there's an absence of anyone saying, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=381.36s)]
*  hey, guys, we should have we should have taken this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=385.32s)]
*  Now, there's an interesting procedural move, Marcus, that the Colorado State Supreme Court [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=387.96s)]
*  used, which I thought was interesting. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  And Steve Vladeck pointed this out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=394.4s)]
*  They basically issued, he says, for those that are worried about Trump's slow walking [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=396.34s)]
*  and appeal to SCOTUS if the D.C. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=399.86s)]
*  Circuit rules against him on immunity, which I think we all anticipate, the Court of Appeals [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=401.88s)]
*  can preempt that by doing what the Colorado Supreme Court did. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=406.44s)]
*  A stay that expires, basically a kind of exploding stay, right, a ticking time bomb, a stay [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=409.88s)]
*  that expires unless Trump seeks certiorari within, say, 14 days. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=415.4s)]
*  So there are some ways the D.C. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=420.68s)]
*  Circuit itself, Marcus, can also attend to the urgency of speed here. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=422.36s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=427.4s)]
*  And if anyone's aware of how the Trump team and folks associated in like the slow walk, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=428.92s)]
*  these investigations, it's me from the committee. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=433.24s)]
*  But I want to point to the 11th Circuit. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=435.32s)]
*  I mean, if we look at that as kind of an indication of how fast these circuit of court opinions [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=439.0s)]
*  can occur, you have to look no further than Mark Meadows just a few weeks ago, right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  It's a different issue. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=446.96s)]
*  It was a removal issue. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=447.96s)]
*  But the court heard argument on December 15th, I believe, and within like December 18th, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=449.23999999999995s)]
*  we had an opinion. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=453.11999999999995s)]
*  And so that's just two or three days. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=454.32s)]
*  And so I think it is smart by the prosecutors and the special counsel here to seek expedited [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=455.84s)]
*  at the D.C. Circuit while also seeking review at the Supreme Court, thinking that this might [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=461.08s)]
*  be a real possibility. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=465.84s)]
*  The Supreme Court wouldn't grant cert here. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=467.0s)]
*  And so now we have a situation where argument we heard on January 9th. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=468.76s)]
*  And as the co-panelists have just said, right, that doesn't push back the trial date too [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=472.48s)]
*  far. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=476.44s)]
*  I mean, let's say we push it back 90 days, as was just suggested. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=477.44s)]
*  A May trial date is still in a good spot for the special counsel's office. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=480.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=484.2s)]
*  And I mean, again, all of this sort of circles, Melissa, this weird combination of the sort [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=485.76s)]
*  of bizarre kind of real politique of a kind of would-be authoritarian who wants to get [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=490.88s)]
*  office so he can stay out of jail and dismiss the cases against him and wants to forestall [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=497.52s)]
*  any judgment before a jury of his peers and the rules of federal procedure, basically. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=502.8s)]
*  And then sort of the cherry on top is the rules of federal procedure kind of are what [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=509.48s)]
*  they are until the court decides they want to move things. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=514.48s)]
*  Like this is what's so interesting to me. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  When you go back and you look at these cert grants before judgment, there's all these [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=519.24s)]
*  COVID cases. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=523.84s)]
*  There's that period of time where the Supreme Court was just like every COVID, you know, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=524.84s)]
*  every local COVID restriction, they were just like hoovering up to the court time and time [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=530.0s)]
*  again. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=536.72s)]
*  They wanted, they could not wait to get in there to tell basically local governments [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=537.72s)]
*  they couldn't shut things down for COVID. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=541.72s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=544.72s)]
*  It's a really great point. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=545.72s)]
*  I do want to push back a little bit. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=546.72s)]
*  I know Harry has made clear that this might result in maybe a 60 or 90 day delay, but [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=549.24s)]
*  a delay is a delay. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=554.68s)]
*  And there wasn't that much cushion in this trial date to begin with. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, the November election is coming. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=560.64s)]
*  There are going to be delays inevitably because this is someone who is determined to delay [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=562.6s)]
*  this and whether it's because he's on the campaign trail or he's got a convention or [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=567.2s)]
*  whatnot, there will be other delays. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=570.48s)]
*  So this is a tactical victory for Donald Trump, even if it's not necessarily an irrational [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  decision by the Supreme Court. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=579.24s)]
*  But Chris, you make an excellent point where this court saw an opportunity to move jurisprudence [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  in a particular direction on a range of issues of incredible salience to the American public. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=586.52s)]
*  They did not flinch at the prospect of granting cert before judgment. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  And we saw it time and time again. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=596.52s)]
*  They were not interested in a fulsome exposition of the issues in the lower federal courts. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=598.88s)]
*  They reached in and they grabbed them and they decided them and they could have done [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=603.9s)]
*  that here too. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=607.7199999999999s)]
*  And I agree this will be more fully briefed after going through the D.C. Circuit. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=609.24s)]
*  The D.C. Circuit is going to do this with considerable expedition, but it is still a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=612.8s)]
*  delay and that makes it a victory. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=616.4s)]
*  Well, yeah, and that Harry is the that's what's so strange about this. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think there's a sort of I think you're both right, right? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  Like it's a delay. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=624.0s)]
*  There's also enough time. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=625.12s)]
*  There's cushion built in. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=626.16s)]
*  But it's it's the first delay. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=627.4s)]
*  And what's so bizarre and surreal about the setting here is that it is it is zero sum in [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=628.84s)]
*  that like literally the number of minutes are a finite amount and they're on the board. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=633.32s)]
*  And the job of Trump's lawyers is just to eat as many of those. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=639.2s)]
*  So every day that they wake up and they gobble some of those minutes off the board and days [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=643.08s)]
*  off the board, like that's a win. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=647.32s)]
*  And they're going to have a whole bunch of bites at it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=649.12s)]
*  Right. There's going to be a whole bunch of ways between now and that first day of an [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=651.52s)]
*  actual trial and then a verdict that they are going to keep taking those bites. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=657.04s)]
*  All true, except maybe the last point. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's absolutely right. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=664.8399999999999s)]
*  Since Chetkin has held she was urged by Smith to say, let's go forward with the pretrial [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  stuff, just hold the trial. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  She said, no, I don't have jurisdiction. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  So a day here equals a day of delay. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=674.76s)]
*  I agree. And I agree with Melissa. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=677.28s)]
*  It's not in substantial delay. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  But this was always remember, Chris, from the time this motion dropped, we saw [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  this as his big opportunity for delay because it gave him the automatic stay. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=687.04s)]
*  So he'll try other strategists for sure. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=692.64s)]
*  But there's reason to believe that Chetkin and the D.C. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=695.2s)]
*  Circuit, if it comes to it, are pretty much onto them. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=698.12s)]
*  So I see this as his big shot for delay. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=701.08s)]
*  I don't know about those other bites at the apple. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=703.92s)]
*  He'll try them, but I don't think she'll receive them very well. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=706.12s)]
*  Right. The key point there is at a certain point, again, if this goes away, there's not [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=710.84s)]
*  a catastrophic ruling finding that he is immune, which I think I think we're all on the same [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=714.92s)]
*  page that they're not going to do that because it would just be so ludicrously and offensively [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=719.0s)]
*  violative of all of all precedent. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=723.6s)]
*  Right. I mean, I mean, who knows, right? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=725.6s)]
*  You know, it's a court with Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas, like there's two votes against [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=727.92s)]
*  Vance. But you know, but you've got you know, you've got the point is that the ball goes [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=733.72s)]
*  back to Chetkin, a certain point who has demonstrated her interest in and understanding the urgency [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=740.0s)]
*  for this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=745.84s)]
*  There's also Marcus. I mean, I guess the sort of point at this point. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=746.84s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Right. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  I think that that is rejected. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So, Marcus, there's you talked about this sort of, you know, the success of this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=753.4000000000001s)]
*  strategy in other places, which I think is really key if you want to talk a little bit [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  about that. Like we saw this with subpoenas. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=760.8000000000001s)]
*  We saw this with Don McGahn. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=763.48s)]
*  I mean, there's all sorts of places where he asserted maximal executive authority, ultimately [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  lost on the merits, but in doing so did manage to run the clock out one, two years in some [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=771.28s)]
*  cases to the point where the loss on the merits was no longer even particularly relevant. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=778.28s)]
*  That's exactly right, Chris. And I actually agree with Professor Murray, right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=783.12s)]
*  This is a delay. So it is technically probably a win from the former president. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=786.16s)]
*  But going to Harry's point, right, this was the cat's out the bag now. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=790.16s)]
*  So once this does get back to the trial court level or to the circuit court level, you can't [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=793.08s)]
*  argue in your filings that this is a political prosecution or a political investigation to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=798.32s)]
*  try to interfere with the election, but then oppose a quick remedy at the Supreme Court [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=803.32s)]
*  level. Those things don't go hand in hand. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=807.84s)]
*  And so I can imagine the trial court pointing that out as they expeditiously make decisions. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=809.88s)]
*  And I think it's important as we continue forward to point out not why would the special [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=815.36s)]
*  counsel want to move so fast, but why would the former president not want to resolve this [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=819.86s)]
*  so fast in the heat of a presidential election? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=823.38s)]
*  And to your point, he's trying to delay and trying to stop the thorough investigation [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=825.98s)]
*  into him. Yes, when you take a step back, it's ludicrous [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=830.86s)]
*  on his face. His assertion is the Constitution bars him from the injury of even standing [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=833.98s)]
*  trial. And so he's facing it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=838.66s)]
*  You would think, obviously and rashly, you would expeditiously want that adjudicated [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=842.54s)]
*  in your favor so that you can stop paying your lawyer's hourly fees and go about the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=846.82s)]
*  rest of your life and running for president. That is the obvious rational thing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=851.22s)]
*  The fact that he's not saying that, Melissa, speaks to what we all know, which is the entire [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=854.62s)]
*  ball game here. I think that's right. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=858.82s)]
*  The other thing I want to say here is like we cannot underestimate the impact of the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=861.94s)]
*  Colorado ruling the other night. I think a big part of this right now is this court really [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=865.82s)]
*  being reluctant to have a whole docket that is chock full of Donald Trump cases. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=872.3s)]
*  The case in Colorado is going to go to the Supreme Court. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=878.06s)]
*  This case doesn't necessarily have to be decided by the Supreme Court. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=881.6999999999999s)]
*  It could be decided by the D.C. Circuit and then appeal to the Supreme Court, which denies [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=884.5799999999999s)]
*  Sir Sherwari in the next instance. So that could happen here too. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=888.62s)]
*  And this could simply be an effort to avoid becoming completely enmeshed in all of the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=892.78s)]
*  machiganness around Donald Trump in this election cycle. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=898.06s)]
*  That would be truly amazing if they did if they deny Sir coming out of D.C. Circuit, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=901.5s)]
*  although also totally justifiable if it's as clear cut a decision as I anticipate it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=904.9s)]
*  will be and as the law would command Melissa Murray, Harry Lippman and Marcus Childress. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  You're great guys. Thank you very much. Happy, happy holidays. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=913.3399999999999s)]
*  Up next, Donald Trump apparently on tape pressuring county Republicans in Michigan to help him [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=917.8599999999999s)]
*  overturn the election in 2020. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson joins me live on that [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=922.8199999999999s)]
*  report next. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=927.86s)]
*  Just weeks after the 2020 election, then President Donald Trump personally pressured local [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=933.5799999999999s)]
*  officials in Michigan to overturn the vote in the state's largest county. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=937.98s)]
*  Now, this comes from new reporting by the Detroit News, which obtained recordings of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  that phone call from November 17th, 2020. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=946.86s)]
*  Now, we actually covered this exact story as it was happening, though we didn't know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=949.86s)]
*  about the recording at eight p.m. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=953.6999999999999s)]
*  On that Tuesday night, just two weeks after the election. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=955.8199999999999s)]
*  Breaking news tonight out of Michigan, where two Republican members of the four person [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=959.86s)]
*  board of canvassers in Wayne County, Michigan, were tasked with certifying the results of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=964.42s)]
*  the election have decided not to do that, citing virtually no evidence of preposterously [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  bad faith mood. Now, Wayne County, of course, the most populous county in the state, it [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=975.9399999999999s)]
*  encompasses Detroit. It went for Joe Biden by over 320,000 votes. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=980.38s)]
*  And the Republican chair of the board, Monica Palmer, is her name's says that she would [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=984.58s)]
*  be open to certifying the vote in communities other than Detroit. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=989.5s)]
*  This certainly appears to be a flagrant attempt by Republicans to just openly steal [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=993.9s)]
*  an election that Joe Biden won by one hundred and forty thousand votes statewide in [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1000.3000000000001s)]
*  Michigan. And on the show, Michigan Secretary of State Democrat Jocelyn Benson told me [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1004.9000000000001s)]
*  she would not let this blatant attempt to cheat stand. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1010.38s)]
*  We have seen multiple attempts to try to disenfranchise and undermine the will of our [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1015.62s)]
*  voters throughout this entire election cycle, particularly after the election. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1019.9s)]
*  Since the the American people have spoken, we still see these attempts to misinform or [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1024.1000000000001s)]
*  confuse citizens about the validity of the results. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1027.98s)]
*  So this is simply an extension of that and a move in the other side's playbook to [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1030.7s)]
*  undermine the will of the people. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1035.02s)]
*  But we're not going to stand for it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1036.82s)]
*  We're going to ensure that every valid vote will count and that the certification of [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1038.02s)]
*  our results will be an official reflection of the will of the people. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1041.58s)]
*  But Republicans were defiant. They even celebrated the move. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1045.86s)]
*  The chair of the state party, Laura Cox, state Republican Party, wrote that she was, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1048.3799999999999s)]
*  quote, proud that enough evidence of irregularities and potential voter fraud was [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1053.18s)]
*  uncovered, resulting in the Wayne County Board of Canvassers refusing to certify their [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1058.3s)]
*  election results. Of course, that's nonsense. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1062.5s)]
*  None was uncovered. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1064.26s)]
*  The president himself tweeted that night, quote, Wow, Michigan just refused to [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1065.66s)]
*  certify the election results. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1069.3s)]
*  Having courage is a beautiful thing. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1070.62s)]
*  The USA stands proud. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1072.14s)]
*  We now know that behind the scenes, Donald Trump was trying to bully the Wayne County [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1074.62s)]
*  Republicans into doing his bidding of going along with the coup. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1078.62s)]
*  On the recorded call from November 17th, Trump told the two Republican members of the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1082.5s)]
*  Wayne County Board of Canvassers that they would look, quote, terrible if they signed [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1086.94s)]
*  the documents to certify the county's election results after they first voted in [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1090.58s)]
*  opposition. Then president added, quote, We've got to fight for our country. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1094.54s)]
*  We can't let these people take our country away from us. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1098.62s)]
*  It's kind of interesting. I've heard that rhetoric before. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1102.34s)]
*  Another point McCall, Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna Romney [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1105.74s)]
*  McDaniel, you know her, right? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1109.8999999999999s)]
*  She's on the call, too. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1111.8999999999999s)]
*  She's, you know, helping them out. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1113.62s)]
*  Tell the Republicans if you can go home tonight, do not sign it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1116.1s)]
*  We will get you attorneys. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1119.02s)]
*  Oh, looks like Ronna was part of the coup. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1120.98s)]
*  And Trump concurred, quote, We'll take care of that. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1124.74s)]
*  Now, luckily, it didn't work after they hung up with the president and after hours [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1127.8999999999999s)]
*  of angry responses from Wayne County residents, God bless them, the Wayne County [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1132.74s)]
*  Board of Canvassers abruptly changed course and certified the results of the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1137.1399999999999s)]
*  November 3rd election. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1140.46s)]
*  The following day, the Republican members actually tried to rescind those votes. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1142.06s)]
*  They both signed affidavits saying they regret their votes, arguing the, quote, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1145.18s)]
*  intense bullying and coercion, plus bad legal advice forced them to agree to [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1148.7s)]
*  certify the election after they had voted no. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1152.82s)]
*  They were unsuccessful and the certification went forward as it should. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1155.62s)]
*  As Secretary Jocelyn Benson put it, quote, What started as the lowest moment of [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1159.06s)]
*  the post-election melee became the most inspiring. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1163.58s)]
*  The voters won, facts and the rule of law carried the day, democracy prevailed. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1166.22s)]
*  Joining me once again is Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1171.02s)]
*  And, Madam Secretary, I want to go back to that period of time because you wrote a [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1175.22s)]
*  long post about it that reminded me of how I was feeling. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1179.1399999999999s)]
*  And I remember having the same kind of, wait a second, feeling because what was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1182.02s)]
*  at issue was that there's a whole bunch of statutorily bipartisan boards that [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1188.14s)]
*  don't have a partisan majority on purpose. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1193.26s)]
*  And the whole point is for them to sort of have this administrative function, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1196.0600000000002s)]
*  which just say like, yep, these numbers line up, we got it, we certify. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1199.42s)]
*  And that if all of a sudden you start radicalizing the Republicans on those [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1203.8600000000001s)]
*  boards to not certify, you can kind of take down the whole integrity of the system. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1209.3s)]
*  And tell me how you were thinking about it as this was playing out. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1214.74s)]
*  Yeah, not just radicalize the members, but cajole and perhaps even bribe them to [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1219.34s)]
*  break the law, to further your political agenda. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1223.82s)]
*  And thanks, Chris, for having me and reminding me that I was with you as all [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1226.14s)]
*  this unfolded play by play. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1231.34s)]
*  It was quite extraordinary and remarkable to see, especially when you had hundreds [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1233.3s)]
*  of citizens show up and demand very cogently and with the law on their side [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1238.7s)]
*  that their votes count. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1243.14s)]
*  It was really inspiring to see citizens have more power than the president of the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1244.5s)]
*  United States even in that moment. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1247.7s)]
*  Yet at the same time, we were also very much aware in that moment that Michigan [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1249.5800000000002s)]
*  and Wayne County in Michigan was to be the first domino to fall in what has since [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1255.06s)]
*  really been unveiled as this elaborate national scheme that went all the way to [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1260.18s)]
*  the tragedy at our U.S. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1265.66s)]
*  Capitol on January 6th, but began with inserting uncertainty and doubt into the [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1266.7s)]
*  certification process in Michigan that would have then been used, as you saw the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1272.26s)]
*  Trump's tweet at the time really was setting up to do to challenge the [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1277.46s)]
*  certification in Pennsylvania, which was going the following week, and then Georgia [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1281.26s)]
*  and Wisconsin after that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1284.5800000000002s)]
*  And so we knew we were the first domino to fall. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1285.7s)]
*  And that's why I was feeling so dejected that night, because if we failed to stop [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1288.3400000000001s)]
*  that domino from falling, that was a win for these this election subversion [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1293.1s)]
*  attempts. And who knows what could happen next? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1297.8999999999999s)]
*  And thankfully, it didn't fall. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1300.9399999999998s)]
*  The people stood firm and as a result, the elections were certified and didn't stop [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1303.74s)]
*  the efforts in other states as we know. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1310.3799999999999s)]
*  But it certainly made it much more difficult and really paved the way for the failure [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1313.2199999999998s)]
*  of the entire effort. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1317.02s)]
*  I think if I'm recalling correctly, and there's a lot going on at the time, I think [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1319.1s)]
*  there was some contemporaneous reporting at the time that the then president Donald [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1323.02s)]
*  Trump was actually reaching out to these individuals on the canvassing board. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1327.8999999999999s)]
*  But now we've got the smoking gun evidence. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1333.26s)]
*  We got a recording of the call reported in the Detroit press. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1335.2199999999998s)]
*  What do you think about the fact that he is he is personally calling the Republicans [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1340.26s)]
*  on the Wayne County Board to get them to go along with this plan, putting the full [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1346.26s)]
*  pressure of the presidency on them? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1350.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, when it happened, we knew I wasn't surprised. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1352.7s)]
*  The reporting in the Detroit News was the first time I had learned of this recording. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1356.1000000000001s)]
*  But it didn't surprise me the content of which we were already well aware that he [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1359.74s)]
*  was trying to pressure these local appointed officials to subvert their own [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1363.9s)]
*  duty, their legal duty under the law. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1370.66s)]
*  We knew that as it was happening. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1372.22s)]
*  And it's really, you know, when you're up against the president of the United States, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1374.3400000000001s)]
*  right, the purported leader of the free world and that we had the truth and the law [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1378.6200000000001s)]
*  and the will of the people on our side, it is really harrowing and scary because you [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1383.78s)]
*  don't know ultimately. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1390.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, democracy is fragile, as that time also revealed to us. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1392.18s)]
*  And when I was on your show in that moment, I didn't know how it was all going to play [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1394.94s)]
*  out, but you hope for people to follow the law and do the best in that moment. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1399.3400000000001s)]
*  And the beauty of that night was that because citizens showed up and demanded democracy [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1402.1399999999999s)]
*  prevail, that's the reason it ultimately did. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1406.62s)]
*  By the way, it's Detroit News, not the Free Press, I want to be clear because it's [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1411.34s)]
*  fantastic reporting and they should get credit where due. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1414.02s)]
*  You correctly named them and I didn't. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1415.94s)]
*  What do you think about the RNC chair and fellow Michigander, Ronna Romney McDaniel, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1418.62s)]
*  playing the role of essentially accomplice, saying we the RNC will provide you with legal [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1424.1399999999999s)]
*  representation to to break the law, to flagrantly violate and subvert election law. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1429.02s)]
*  That to me is real news here, the degree to which she was an accomplice in this phone [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1435.5s)]
*  call. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1439.66s)]
*  Well, you know, before that, she had held a press conference in Michigan with it was [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1440.98s)]
*  just filled with misinformation and lies about our elections. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1444.7s)]
*  And so, again, no surprise to me, frankly, and we know the coordination and the amount [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1447.9s)]
*  of focus on Michigan was clear as we were living through this. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1453.1s)]
*  So I wasn't surprised. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1457.6200000000001s)]
*  It's in some ways validating and gratifying to see this additional evidence, because in [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1458.98s)]
*  many ways, this entire three year battle has been this this battle between evidence, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1463.5s)]
*  evidence and proof of fair elections and efforts to subvert it and efforts to confuse [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1468.8600000000001s)]
*  the reality, to spread misinformation about that. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1474.82s)]
*  So the more proof and evidence we have, as this tape shows, the stronger we feel going [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1477.14s)]
*  into 2024 and all these criminal proceedings that the law and justice will also prevail. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1482.38s)]
*  We'll see. It's still unfolding. But my hope is emboldened, I guess, and bolstered [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1488.3000000000002s)]
*  through this reporting and what's been revealed to this recording. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1492.74s)]
*  Final question for you quickly. There is a lawsuit in the state of Michigan to remove [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1497.38s)]
*  Donald Trump from the ballot pursuant to the third section three of the 14th Amendment [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1501.22s)]
*  Use Constitution, similar to the lawsuit that prevailed in Colorado at the state Supreme [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1505.3400000000001s)]
*  Court. It has been rejected by a state appeals court. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1509.7s)]
*  They have rejected the arguments that plan us to remove him, but it now goes on appeal [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1513.18s)]
*  to the state Supreme Court. Does your office have a position on that lawsuit? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1516.1000000000001s)]
*  No, we don't. I mean, as I've said, I don't think it's appropriate for secretaries of [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1520.94s)]
*  state when there are so many nuances and factual determinations and the interpretations of [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1524.7s)]
*  the law. This is not, to me, as cut and dried of an issue as is this a third term for [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1529.3400000000001s)]
*  President Obama, as some people have tried to make the analogy. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1533.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a nuanced, tricky decision that is best left to the courts. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1536.5800000000002s)]
*  I do in general believe in ballot access and that we should enable people to be on the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1540.8600000000001s)]
*  ballot. That's what democracy is about to me. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1546.3400000000001s)]
*  But we'll see how the court and ultimately the U.S. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1548.9s)]
*  Supreme Court determines this issue, which and of course, the U.S. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1550.8600000000001s)]
*  court will be the final arbiter of the decision for every state. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1554.0600000000002s)]
*  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, good to have you back here a few years later. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1558.6200000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. All right. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1562.98s)]
*  Have a good night. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1564.74s)]
*  You too. Much more still ahead, including the unexpected tightening of the Republican [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1566.38s)]
*  presidential primary and the escalating hate speech from the front. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1570.7s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1573.98s)]
*  After Donald Trump said clearly in an interview that immigrants are poisoning the blood of [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1580.6200000000001s)]
*  our country, echoing the words of Adolf Hitler, he repeated that language at an Iowa [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1584.9s)]
*  rally and Republican leaders who owe their jobs to Trump's support are once again finding [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1589.18s)]
*  ways to excuse the inexcusable. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1593.8200000000002s)]
*  We didn't say immigrants were poisoning the blood of this country. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1596.5400000000002s)]
*  He said illegal immigrants were poisoning the blood of the country, which is objectively [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1599.42s)]
*  and obviously true to anybody who looks at the statistics about fentanyl overdoses. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1604.0600000000002s)]
*  It's like an exercise in trying to edit what Trump says after he says it and then changing [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1610.14s)]
*  the subject by pushing more lies such as migrants are responsible for our fentanyl crisis. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1613.9s)]
*  None of this Nazi like rhetoric is new to Trump, including another recent comment calling [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1619.5800000000002s)]
*  his political enemies, quote, vermin. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1624.02s)]
*  As Jonathan Karl of ABC News lays out, Trump is a history of showing admiration for the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1625.98s)]
*  Nazi regime, quote, as President Trump reportedly complained that America's military leaders [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1630.18s)]
*  were not totally loyal to him, telling his chief of staff, retired Marine Corps General [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1635.06s)]
*  John Kelly, why can't you be like the German generals? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1639.9s)]
*  Jonathan Karl joins us now. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1643.82s)]
*  He's chief Washington correspondent for ABC News. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1645.34s)]
*  His new book is called Tired of Winning Donald Trump and the End of the Grand Old Party. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1647.74s)]
*  The sort of recent bout of this kind of explicitly fascistic rhetoric is not particularly [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1652.54s)]
*  surprising. And I think it comes in line with much of the reporting themes in your very [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1660.6599999999999s)]
*  good book. What do you make of it and why it's growing more explicit now? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1664.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, to me, the thing that is most alarming is that Trump, you could have a debate whether [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1671.82s)]
*  or not he knew when he talked about poisoning the blood that he was actually quoting directly [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1678.3s)]
*  from Mein Kampf. You could have an argument about whether when he said vermin, when he [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1684.5s)]
*  described his enemies as vermin, that he was using third right language. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1688.58s)]
*  But this has now been pointed out and he has said, I mean, to see him at a rally in Iowa, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1692.78s)]
*  proclaim that he had never read Mein Kampf and they say this language came from there. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1698.46s)]
*  And then he goes on and he continues to use the phrase again, poisoning our blood. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1705.3s)]
*  And today, in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, he again talks about it, again denies he has [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1710.9s)]
*  read Hitler. But clearly now that's well-versed in the fact that this is a language [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1715.9s)]
*  echoing Hitler. And he says it again repeatedly in that interview today. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1722.46s)]
*  So he has no problem whatsoever with the fact that his rhetoric is an echo of the [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1727.0600000000002s)]
*  rhetoric that Adolf Hitler used. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1734.18s)]
*  You know, one of the things I think, and this comes through in your book as well, and a [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1736.5800000000002s)]
*  lot of reporting on Trump, it can be a little hard, like what are the things the man [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1739.94s)]
*  genuinely believes in? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1743.78s)]
*  One of the things I think he truly and genuinely believes in, almost at a kind of like [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1745.18s)]
*  cellular level, is that strong men are good, that actually democracy is not that good, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1748.5800000000002s)]
*  and that the way to run a place really is like she runs China, is like Kim Jong-un [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1753.02s)]
*  runs North Korea. I mean, the amount of like, it's just very evident in both things he [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1759.1000000000001s)]
*  says in public and everyone who's worked with him, that he genuinely admires, likes, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1763.5s)]
*  respects and thinks it would be good to have a system of absolute leadership like in [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1768.34s)]
*  China, North Korea or, you know, past European autocracies. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1774.86s)]
*  And Trump, of course, has a temper, but the times that he has been most explosively [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1779.46s)]
*  angry as president were the moments when he didn't get precisely what he wanted. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1785.94s)]
*  So when Bill Barr does not follow his demands to use the Department of Justice to help [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1792.74s)]
*  overturn the election and in fact says there was no fraud, he explodes. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1799.06s)]
*  I had I talked to somebody that was in the meeting after Barr came out with his statement [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1803.34s)]
*  on December 1st of 2020, who said it seemed like Trump was trying to control himself. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1808.42s)]
*  Of course, we learned from Cassidy Hutchinson later that after that meeting was over, there [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1813.34s)]
*  was ketchup on the wall. The president, you know, upending his his lunch. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1817.74s)]
*  He got angry when Milley and Esper would not go through with the his demands to bring [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1822.42s)]
*  active duty U.S. military to the streets of American cities, to the streets of Washington, D.C. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1830.18s)]
*  So I think he admires the strongman and the times when he was most frustrated was when he [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1836.54s)]
*  couldn't actually be the strongman. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1842.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's the theme of my book, is that next time around, he will do whatever he can to [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1844.34s)]
*  ensure that those who frustrated him the first time he was in the White House would not [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1850.74s)]
*  frustrate him a second time. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1855.9s)]
*  So nobody refusing to do his demands, whatever they are. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1857.34s)]
*  There's a there's an anecdote you've reported. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1862.98s)]
*  It appears in this book, I think it also previously seen versions of it that I think really [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1865.1s)]
*  explains the dynamic between the Republican Party institutionally and Trump and the way they [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1870.6200000000001s)]
*  kind of both are sort of need each other for certain things. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1874.74s)]
*  You talk about this is after he's leaving that that aboard Air Force One, Trump was already plotting [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1877.8999999999999s)]
*  the next stage of his political career. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1882.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm done. He told Republican National Committee Chairman Ronan McDaniel on the phone. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1884.62s)]
*  I'm starting my own party. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1888.74s)]
*  You cannot do that. She said, if you do, we will lose forever. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1890.26s)]
*  There it is. And that's that's basically the thrust of it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1892.9799999999998s)]
*  And then she pleaded with Trump when that failed miserably. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1896.5s)]
*  She and her top aides changed their approach, reminding the former president leaving the party [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1898.5s)]
*  would cost him millions of dollars. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1901.6599999999999s)]
*  If he went through the plan, the RNC would not would not only stop paying his legal bills, it [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1903.34s)]
*  would also prevent him from raising money off the database of Trump supporters he and the party [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1908.06s)]
*  owned jointly within a week. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1911.98s)]
*  Trump backed down that this is this sort of arrangement of convenience is that the RNC [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1914.18s)]
*  can't win. Republicans can't win if he breaks from the party. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1919.66s)]
*  If he and I think there's an issue they have to contemplate if you ever lose a primary. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1922.18s)]
*  And he needs the party for its resources in raising money. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1926.86s)]
*  Yeah, and to me, it's it's one of the great what ifs of of the period between the end of the Trump [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1930.78s)]
*  presidency and where we are now, where he is once again has apparently total control over this [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1936.6599999999999s)]
*  party is what if Ronan McDaniel had instead of begging him and then threatening him to stay in [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1942.62s)]
*  the party, it said good riddance. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1948.86s)]
*  Go. Yeah. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1950.6999999999998s)]
*  It's a similar question with McCarthy. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1951.6599999999999s)]
*  What if he had said to Trump, you know, bye bye instead of going to plead to bring him back in [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1953.1399999999999s)]
*  just a week after he left the White House. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1959.14s)]
*  They both calculated that they needed all those Trump supporters to be energized and voting. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1961.22s)]
*  But, you know, the real question is, first of all, they've lost election after election with [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1968.78s)]
*  Trump back in the tent. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1976.38s)]
*  And now they're headed down this path. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1978.3400000000001s)]
*  If by some miracle, Nikki Haley wins the Republican nomination, we're going to be back to [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1980.38s)]
*  a very similar situation. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1985.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1986.7399999999998s)]
*  You know, because Trump's not going to concede. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1987.7399999999998s)]
*  I'm sure he'll just be like, well, you know, you win some, you lose some. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1990.7399999999998s)]
*  Nikki Haley fair and square. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1993.26s)]
*  Good fight. Let's go do the joint endorsement event. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1994.82s)]
*  Jonathan Karl, whose new book, Tired of Winning Donald Trump and the End of the Grand Old [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=1997.2199999999998s)]
*  Party is out now. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2001.86s)]
*  John, thanks so much. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2002.8999999999999s)]
*  Great. Thank you, Chris. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2004.1799999999998s)]
*  Up next, Donald Trump loses his cool over his new primary polling. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2006.3s)]
*  Jonathan was sort of obliquely referring to what's behind the Nikki Haley surge in New [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2009.9799999999998s)]
*  Hampshire and will it actually make any difference? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2014.02s)]

*  And that's why I think Donald Trump shouldn't be president is not only does chaos follow [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2033.5400000000002s)]

*  He's too busy wanting to fix the grievances of the past. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2041.38s)]
*  We can't have that. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2044.5400000000002s)]

*  David, let me start with you. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2082.66s)]
*  You know, it's been my position position, the show that like, you know, the future's [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2083.66s)]
*  uncertain. Donald Trump is the likely nominee, if I had to bet. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2088.8599999999997s)]
*  But also, hey, go make a run at it. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2092.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, let's try. And that the only viable possibility for a contested primary would [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2095.1s)]
*  be a one on one Haley Trump contest. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2100.8999999999996s)]
*  The polling seems to suggest she has some genuine traction in New Hampshire. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2104.46s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2108.46s)]
*  Totally agree. And I think the strategy that each candidate, other than Trump, started [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2110.5s)]
*  with remains the strategy today to bring it to a one on one contest and hope you get [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  some help that somehow Donald Trump gets knocked out. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2119.42s)]
*  Not so much by Republican disfavor, maybe by the courts or a combination of them. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2122.06s)]
*  So why is it Nikki Haley? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2127.14s)]
*  I think not to not to belittle her surge, but it's in part the failings of all the [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2129.3s)]
*  other candidates. Chris Christie took a strategy of taking on Donald Trump directly, and [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2134.54s)]
*  it didn't work. Mike Pence kind of did the same thing. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2138.54s)]
*  Ron DeSantis in choosing culture wars almost defined himself as an unserious candidate [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2141.9s)]
*  for all of the hard rights, hard populism of Donald Trump. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2148.3s)]
*  He really was not a culture warrior, is not. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2151.82s)]
*  He's a transactional politician. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2154.18s)]
*  He gave the chamber big tax cuts and deregulation. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2155.78s)]
*  He gave the the pro-life crowd daubs. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2158.78s)]
*  He you know, he gives that the frankly the anti diversity crowd within the Republican [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2161.42s)]
*  Party, the quieting of votes of communities of color. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2167.3s)]
*  But it's all transactional. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2171.1400000000003s)]
*  Ron DeSantis chose culture wars and became unserious. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2172.7400000000002s)]
*  Nikki Haley's left being the steady Eddie, the person who actually could be president if [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2177.38s)]
*  Donald Trump fails. I think her numbers are real. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2181.26s)]
*  It's the last remaining storyline in the Republican primary. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2183.5800000000004s)]
*  Is Nikki Haley for real and could she be the alternative? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2186.7s)]
*  You know, on the on the Democratic side, there is not really a particularly active [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2190.9s)]
*  primary contest, Heather. Obviously, there's Dean Phillips, who's challenging Joe Biden, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2194.2200000000003s)]
*  that there's not really much going on there. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2198.42s)]
*  Polling wise, the sort of the thing that Joe Biden was able to do in 2020 was to unite [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2201.62s)]
*  the various parts of the Democratic coalition, which are, you know, quite diverse and [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2206.5s)]
*  diffuse and difficult to unite. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2211.62s)]
*  And there's some signs that that unity is cracking right now, particularly that I'm [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2213.74s)]
*  curious to get your thoughts on the on the youth vote. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2217.8199999999997s)]
*  This is now not just one poll. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2221.3399999999997s)]
*  It's actually a series of polls that we've seen showing over and over the same thing. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2222.7s)]
*  18 to 29 year olds. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2227.14s)]
*  The Times poll actually has Donald Trump winning 18 to 29 year olds by six points after [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2230.1s)]
*  Biden was winning them by 10 points in July. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2235.3399999999997s)]
*  Now, you know, I don't think it's flipped that much. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2237.62s)]
*  I think polling that group is a little difficult. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2240.3399999999997s)]
*  But what do you what do you see there, Heather? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2241.94s)]
*  Listen, I think you cannot under count how significant young voters have been for [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2245.14s)]
*  Democrats for the past three elections, overperforming, absolutely tilting in a way [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2250.94s)]
*  that felt like a generational seismic and permanent shift because of their ideas on [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2257.42s)]
*  each of the issues that they associate with the Democratic Party. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2263.14s)]
*  What we're seeing now in the polling among young people, looking at people like RFK, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2266.46s)]
*  more than they're looking at Joe Biden, is really, really dangerous. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2272.38s)]
*  And I think that's being driven by a number of issues. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2276.94s)]
*  One, they just don't see Joe Biden. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2279.66s)]
*  Right. Joe Biden is not a fixture in the cultural conversation. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2282.58s)]
*  Correct. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2287.02s)]
*  Fixture in the media. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2287.42s)]
*  People, you know, attribute things to other politicians that Joe Biden has done. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2288.82s)]
*  People blame Joe Biden for things like the Dobbs decision because it happened under his [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2295.3s)]
*  watch. Right. There's just a lot of the message not getting out there. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2299.46s)]
*  A lot of the sort of brand that is Joe Biden, that is simply not penetrating among, you [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2304.42s)]
*  know, moderate and low information voters. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2309.7400000000002s)]
*  But then also when you look at the things that really, really matter to young people, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2312.2200000000003s)]
*  these moral issues and these big defining issues of climate change, of reproductive [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2316.7000000000003s)]
*  freedom, of student debt in terms of their own pockets, you just haven't seen the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2322.74s)]
*  Biden administration for all of the incredible wins that it has delivered on things from [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2328.66s)]
*  health care to junk fees to all of this. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2334.7s)]
*  These big things, housing, student loan debt, climate change and reproductive choice, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2338.22s)]
*  they haven't delivered. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2343.9799999999996s)]
*  They haven't been able to go the final mile. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2345.4599999999996s)]
*  A lot of that's had to do with the Supreme Court, but it hasn't made a difference in [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2347.22s)]
*  young people's lives. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2350.74s)]
*  And so Democrats, Democratic donors, Democratic operatives are really going to have to fund [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2351.8599999999997s)]
*  the grassroots organizations, the single issue organizations, the community organizations, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2357.22s)]
*  the student groups that are the trusted messengers to be able to turn it around for the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2362.54s)]
*  Democratic Party and the top of the ticket. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2367.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that point we're going to do more next week. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2370.02s)]
*  I want to actually take on the student debt thing head on. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2371.7s)]
*  I think we're going to do something about it next week because you've got this maddening [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2374.02s)]
*  situation in which you've got a combination of student loan repayments have started. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2377.46s)]
*  People get that. The loan forgiveness was blocked by a right wing court and opposed [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2382.38s)]
*  completely by the entirety of the Republican Party, from Donald Trump to basically every [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2386.94s)]
*  member of Congress and Senate to every lobbying group for Republicans. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2391.2200000000003s)]
*  And then the reality is, well, I got to pay my student loans back. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2394.58s)]
*  Joe Biden is the president. It's like this incredibly perverse political outcome to this [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2396.94s)]
*  entire story that I think is worth taking some time on. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2401.14s)]
*  David, I want to ask you about this new result, that there's some breaking news here in Wisconsin. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2405.3399999999997s)]
*  This has been one of the most contentious fights in the whole nation over the most aggressive [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2410.14s)]
*  state gerrymander probably in the entire country. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2414.8599999999997s)]
*  The Wisconsin Republicans who have gerrymandered themselves a legislative map that basically [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2417.5s)]
*  guarantees them essentially a two to one super majority in the state legislature in both houses. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2421.74s)]
*  Even when the Democrat at the top of the ticket, Tony Evers, for example, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2429.8999999999996s)]
*  wins statewide, thanks to a switch in the personnel on the court, they have now thrown [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2435.02s)]
*  those maps out after a very, very long battle in that state. What do you think of it? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2441.18s)]
*  Yeah. And that last point is probably the most important, the hard work of progressive and [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2446.62s)]
*  democratic activists. But let's get to the substance. Wisconsin has been a hotbed of [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2450.62s)]
*  gerrymandering and gerrymandering jurisprudence going all the way to the Supreme Court recently. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2455.66s)]
*  And the question that the high court wrestles with is we know that gerrymandering on race and gender [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2460.54s)]
*  is unconstitutional, but can you gerrymander on partisan and political grounds? It's called the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2466.14s)]
*  efficiency gap. As you point out in Wisconsin, it's relatively a 50-50 state elected a democratic [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2471.7400000000002s)]
*  governor, but Republicans have so gerrymandered the state legislature, it's a two to one majority. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2477.18s)]
*  What happened earlier this year? Progressive and democratic activists worked very, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2483.02s)]
*  very hard. Chris, you know this well, the reward was they elected a Supreme Court justice that [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2487.58s)]
*  tilted the scale towards the democratic elected judges. And they just ruled that, no, you can't do [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2493.26s)]
*  two to one majority for Republicans in a 50-50 state. It won't affect Congress or the presidency, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2499.26s)]
*  but all of a sudden we have a very ripe gerrymandering question. And in Wisconsin, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2504.38s)]
*  all lines for state legislature districts now have to be redrawn. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2509.42s)]
*  And we've seen, Heather, the way those super majorities have acted, particularly on questions [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2513.9s)]
*  like DOBS and other things in states like Ohio and other places. Heather, I want you to come back. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2517.66s)]
*  Will you promise me you'll come back and we could talk about the student stuff? Because I'm really [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2522.38s)]
*  worked up about it. And I want to talk to you about it because it's driving me really batty, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2525.58s)]
*  the way this has all played out. It should be said that the administration has canceled more [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2530.94s)]
*  student debt for more people than in history, almost $130 billion in student debt. I saw a lot [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2535.58s)]
*  of my student debt after always working for nonprofits disappear. They've done a lot, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2542.06s)]
*  but the court has stopped them from doing what they wanted. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2547.5s)]
*  All right. David Jolly, Heather McGee, have a great holiday. Both of you, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2551.2599999999998s)]
*  I hope you get some time off. It was great to talk to you both. Thanks. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2554.86s)]
*  Much more still to come, including the breaking news out of the Supreme Court, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2559.58s)]
*  which just declined to take up Jack Smith's appeal for a quick ruling on Trump's immunity [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2562.54s)]
*  argument this week. We've got the power duo of Andrew Weissman, Mary McCord joining me on that [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2566.78s)]
*  next. Don't go anywhere. Thank you for sticking with us for this special two hour edition of [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2572.3s)]
*  All In with Chris Hayes. The Supreme Court has rejected special counsel Jack Smith's request to [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2585.1000000000004s)]
*  fast track the question of whether or not Donald Trump has immunity from his election interference [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2589.7400000000002s)]
*  criminal case. It was an unsigned one sentence decision, quote, you see it right here, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2594.06s)]
*  the petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment is denied. There were no dissents. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2598.7799999999997s)]
*  It was a clever, but risky gambit from Smith. He tried to escalate the question of Trump's [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2604.62s)]
*  presidential immunity in this case, directly the Supreme Court, skipping over the rung of the [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2609.34s)]
*  ladder that would be appellate court, so to speak. But the Supreme Court was not receptive to that [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2615.66s)]
*  idea and said forcing the appeal to move through the usual process, which does open up further [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2620.22s)]
*  opportunities for the ex-president to delay. In a recent filing, Smith explained the need to move [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2625.1s)]
*  expeditiously saying, quote, the public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors an [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2630.2999999999997s)]
*  immediate definitive decision by this court. The charges here are of the utmost gravity. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2634.4599999999996s)]
*  For their part, Trump and his lawyers took the position that there was simply no rush, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2639.4199999999996s)]
*  insisting there was, quote, no compelling reason for the extraordinary haste, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2642.7799999999997s)]
*  complaining that undersmiths timeline, quote, President Trump will be subjected to a months [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2646.54s)]
*  long criminal trial at the height of a presidential campaign. Although it is difficult to divine too [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2650.3s)]
*  much from the court's one sentence ruling today, it appears as though the sixth stream conservative [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2655.18s)]
*  majority may have agreed with that argument, all of which makes it much like clear the ex-president [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2659.74s)]
*  and his legal team will now at least attempt to keep delaying and delaying until they reach such [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2664.54s)]
*  a point where they can convince the court to punt the entire case until after the election. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2668.86s)]
*  Andrew Weissman was a senior member of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigative team. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2673.3399999999997s)]
*  Mary McCord serves as the acting assistant attorney general for national security at the [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2677.3399999999997s)]
*  Department of Justice. Together, they host the Prosecuting Donald Trump podcast, and they join [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2682.06s)]
*  me now. I've been doing an informal canvas of the many legal people in my life and their reaction [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2687.02s)]
*  to this declining cert before judgment of the Supreme Court. So I'll go to you and get your [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2694.3799999999997s)]
*  reaction. Andrew, starting with you first. I don't think it's that big a deal, to be honest. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2700.38s)]
*  The reason I say that is because the DC circuit has expedited their review. In fact, they're [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2709.02s)]
*  having their oral argument after full briefing on January 9th. So there was a lot of pressure on the [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2716.7000000000003s)]
*  Supreme Court, just as a matter of courtesy and deference to let them go first since we're only [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2723.34s)]
*  talking about a matter of weeks. The critical issue, the one that I will keep my eye on, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2728.78s)]
*  is what the Supreme Court does and what the DC circuit does after it rules. And there, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2734.94s)]
*  the real issue is there's this automatic stay in place. And the question is whether the DC circuit [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2742.86s)]
*  or the Supreme Court are going to expedite sort of the appeals process, because the normal appeals [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2748.6200000000003s)]
*  process is quite slow. And so that's the thing to keep your eye on. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2754.38s)]
*  Andrew So, Mary, what do you think? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2759.6600000000003s)]
*  Mary Flauhrin Yeah, I think similarly, you know, the DC circuit has issued such a very, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2761.6600000000003s)]
*  very highly expedited briefing schedule. The first opening briefs of Mr. Trump's team are due [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2768.3s)]
*  tomorrow. The government has to respond by December 30th. Reply briefs due January 2nd, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2773.6600000000003s)]
*  argument January 9th. This is a court that's ready to rule expeditiously. But as Andrew says, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2780.14s)]
*  let's just assume that they affirm Judge Chuck Kinn's ruling that there is no absolute immunity [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2786.3799999999997s)]
*  for the former president. Normally, that the appeal to the Supreme Court first an appeal for [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2792.94s)]
*  full review of the DC circuit, then appeal to the Supreme Court would take a long time. But if the [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2798.3799999999997s)]
*  DC circuit were to lift the stay of the trial court proceedings, that would mean that those [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2802.86s)]
*  proceedings would start going again, and lessen until Mr. Trump gets them stopped by the Supreme [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2810.38s)]
*  Court. And here's where I would analogize to the Trump v. Thompson case from two years ago. This is [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2817.1000000000004s)]
*  a case that my organization was also involved with representing the House Select Committee, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2823.1800000000003s)]
*  when the House Select Committee was litigating over access to presidential records for which [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2827.82s)]
*  the former president was asserting executive privilege. The trial court judge, Judge Chuck [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2833.5800000000004s)]
*  Kinn, ruled against the former president. She was affirmed by the DC circuit. The DC circuit [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2839.5s)]
*  issued an administrative stay of its ruling for the president to go or the former president to seek [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2845.1000000000004s)]
*  a stay in the Supreme Court, which then he had to ask quickly because otherwise that administrative [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2853.34s)]
*  stay would expire. And so that same thing could happen here, in which case if the DC circuit said [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2858.38s)]
*  we're lifting the stay, we're giving you a week to seek it in the Supreme Court, we'll hold on to [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2865.1000000000004s)]
*  it for then, then Trump's got to act. So here's, Andrew, I'm going to confess a hole in my Civ Pro [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2871.1000000000004s)]
*  knowledge, which is maybe embarrassing and maybe not, but do you get a by-right appeal to NBUNC? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2878.86s)]
*  So if the three-judge panel rules against you, which I think we all anticipate in this, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2885.26s)]
*  do you get to automatically go on BUNC? No. In normal course, you don't automatically, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2889.26s)]
*  but you can ask to do that and you have a certain amount of time to ask. And that's where, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2897.02s)]
*  you know, since we're talking about a race against the clock, it's that, those sort of two-step [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2904.54s)]
*  process, which is if you are seeking the en banc review, now there's the whole court in the DC [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2909.74s)]
*  court of appeals to review, then if you wait for that and then you seek cert, you seek Supreme [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2915.66s)]
*  Court review, all of that are the delays. But as Mary is correctly pointing out, there are ways that [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2921.18s)]
*  the circuit can really tighten that up. And the main way is to essentially get rid of this [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2926.4599999999996s)]
*  automatic stay so that the district court can go on its merry way. Because remember right now, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2933.5s)]
*  it's not just that the trial is stayed, all litigation at the trial level is stayed. So [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2939.98s)]
*  all of the preparation for that trial is being stayed. So there really is an enormous prejudice [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2946.62s)]
*  to Jack Smith's case going forward right now. I want to turn in a second to the question of [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2952.06s)]
*  the Supreme Court's possible review of that Colorado Supreme Court case. But one more [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2959.34s)]
*  question on this. I mean, the thing, and you and I talked about this, the two of you and we were on [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2963.42s)]
*  stage together in Austin earlier this year for a live edition of the Prosecuting Donald Trump [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2966.6200000000003s)]
*  podcast and why is this happening? I mean, the nightmare scenario, right, Mary? It's like if you [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2971.7400000000002s)]
*  had the most devious, bad faith sort of pro-Trump actor on the court, you'd be like, okay, we'll take [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2975.58s)]
*  it and then we're going to slot it for arguments in the fall and we'll stay the trial until then. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2982.6200000000003s)]
*  And then we'll see in the fall and we'll see. Like, they could do that, right? I mean, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2988.06s)]
*  I guess my question is, what do you, I guess I don't anticipate they would possibly be that [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2992.7799999999997s)]
*  craven. But what do you think, Mary? And it's not just one person really who could do that. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=2998.2999999999997s)]
*  Because if, if let's say that Donald Trump then seeks cert, let's assume the DC Circuit affirms [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3004.38s)]
*  Judge Chuckin and he seeks cert in the Supreme Court, Jack Smith will move for an expedited [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3010.86s)]
*  review. And that will be something that that motion will be circulated to all nine justices, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3018.0600000000004s)]
*  assuming all nine participate and Justice Thomas doesn't recuse and there's no indication he [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3023.82s)]
*  recused from this initial petition for cert before judgment. So that means all nine justices will [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3028.38s)]
*  weigh in. And so it's not, it doesn't require a unanimous vote or anything like that, but I [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3034.0600000000004s)]
*  think it would take at least four or probably actually more like five to, to Grant and I. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3040.06s)]
*  So, so, so a single person couldn't really put this off. A single justice couldn't really put [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3045.74s)]
*  this off. That's a great point. I want to play something that Donald Trump just said about [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3051.1s)]
*  Supreme Court review of the Colorado Supreme Court, four, three majority finding that under [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3056.2999999999997s)]
*  the section three of the 14th amendment, the president's disqualified from the ballot because [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3061.58s)]
*  he participated in gave aid and comfort to an insurrection. And this is Donald Trump, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3065.5s)]
*  I think frankly threatening some sort of civic unrest slash violence, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3071.82s)]
*  unless the Supreme Court review, you know, reverses, but take, take a listen to what he has to say. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3076.06s)]
*  If they ever did that, it would be so bad for this country. You have no idea. You understand it would [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3084.22s)]
*  be, it would be a big problem for the country. Oh, I think it will be a nine oh reversal. I hope [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3089.02s)]
*  it comes today, but I want to make sure you appeal. I think that's the kind of a reversal. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3094.46s)]
*  It should not be given any credit, not even the credit of one Supreme Court justice. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3098.94s)]
*  That's his coach and major Domo. They're making sure that the legal team is on top of it. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3104.94s)]
*  But one of the things that sort of strikes me here in that, in that language, Andrew, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3109.82s)]
*  and we've seen this in the, is that this is not a legal concern, but it is a civic concern, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3113.82s)]
*  which is that the threat of violence and directly threats towards judges and justices [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3119.26s)]
*  looms over the entirety of all of these processes. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3125.5800000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. Although I have to say that clip is, is not as bad as some of the other things that [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3130.7000000000003s)]
*  we've heard from Donald Trump and his, um, his allies. Um, it is also of course incredibly [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3135.6600000000003s)]
*  ironic because this is the person who sort of began his sort of presidential career, uh, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3143.26s)]
*  claiming birtherism, um, and trying to say that, um, Barack Obama should not be qualified, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3149.9s)]
*  should be essentially as disqualified under the constitution because he wasn't born as in the [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3157.34s)]
*  United States. Um, so he's very aware of the ability under the constitution, um, to have someone [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3162.38s)]
*  disqualified. Um, and it's, it's also not exactly anti-democratic. I mean, the constitution is part [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3169.66s)]
*  of our democracy. Having said that, these are real issues. I mean, I, the issue of the Supreme [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3176.06s)]
*  Court should take this. These are important issues. It is, it is undecided because we've never had a [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3181.74s)]
*  former president, um, running in this situation. Um, and so it is important for the Supreme Court [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3188.7799999999997s)]
*  to weigh in, not just for this case, but for all future cases. Um, and, you know, I could understand [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3194.78s)]
*  if you were a party saying that you think that no justice should dissent, I could imagine the other [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3201.1800000000003s)]
*  side would, would say the, would say the opposite. Um, but this is all going to be litigated and [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3205.98s)]
*  that's what it means to be in a country, um, that has the rule of law. Um, and of course, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3210.94s)]
*  and just to state the obvious, the reserve to violence is, is the antithesis of the rule of law. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3216.6200000000003s)]
*  All right. Uh, Andrew Weissman and Marion McCord, thank you so much for joining me on this, uh, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3222.3799999999997s)]
*  pre Christmas weekend Friday show. I really appreciate it. Have a great holiday. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3226.8599999999997s)]
*  You too. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3231.8999999999996s)]
*  It's been three years, but there's still new evidence coming to light showing the extent of [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3234.4599999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump's personal pressure campaign on election officials in 2020. We'll get into the latest next. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3238.3799999999997s)]
*  Even as special counsel, Jack Smith prepares to take Donald Trump to trial over his attempts to [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3243.5s)]
*  steal the 2020 election, we are still learning new details three years later about the lengths the [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3247.66s)]
*  ex-president went to. As we've covered on the show before, back in November, 2020, two Republican [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3253.02s)]
*  election officials in Wayne County, Michigan, initially refused to certify President Biden's [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3258.7s)]
*  victory the last year. The former president was a Republican, and the former president was a [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3264.78s)]
*  initially refused to certify President Biden's victory there before changing their minds, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3269.66s)]
*  voting to certify and ending the standoff. Just 30 minutes after that meeting ended, Trump called [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3274.7s)]
*  the two officials urging them to reverse course again and go back to blocking Biden's victory. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3279.82s)]
*  Now we know finally what Trump said on that call. Thanks to great reporting by the Detroit news [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3285.74s)]
*  joined by none other than RNC chair, Rana Romney McDaniel. Trump promised to provide attorneys for [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3291.5s)]
*  the two officials. He also told the pair they would look quote terrible if they signed the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3297.58s)]
*  official certification document adding quote, we've got to fight for our country. We can't let these [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3301.8199999999997s)]
*  people take our country away from us. Following the call, the two canvassers then did try to do [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3307.02s)]
*  what Trump asked and undo their votes to certify Biden's victory. Thankfully, the plan did not [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3312.62s)]
*  work. The ship had sailed as it were. Notably when pressed about the calls three years ago, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3318.06s)]
*  because we knew calls were happening, one of the election officials, Monica Palmer, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3323.02s)]
*  said Trump was merely checking in on her well being. The portions of the call reviewed by the [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3326.94s)]
*  Detroit news did not include comments by Trump to that effect. We should note NBC news has not [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3333.7400000000002s)]
*  independently verified these recordings. But as the Detroit news notes, neither Palmer nor McDaniel [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3339.42s)]
*  and Trump through spokespeople disputed a summary of the call when contacted by the news. The second [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3344.2200000000003s)]
*  Wayne County canvasser William Hartman died in 2021. Joining me now are Lisa Rubin, MSNBC [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3350.14s)]
*  legal analyst, and George Conway, conservative attorney. There's a lot to talk about. I want to [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3356.06s)]
*  talk about the sort of new revelations coming out of Michigan and what they could mean, particularly [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3360.06s)]
*  what they might mean for both Jack Smith's case and other state-based cases. But also because [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3364.2999999999997s)]
*  we've got this Supreme Court denial of cert before judgment, I want to get your reactions to it, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3369.1s)]
*  because we've been sort of asking different legal folks what they think. George, if I'm not mistaken, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3373.66s)]
*  you worked on the Jones v. Clinton brief on the side of Paula Jones, which was an immunity case [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3379.2599999999998s)]
*  in a civil context saying President Clinton should have to sit for a deposition. He was not [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3385.5s)]
*  entitled to immunity. You guys won that case 9-0, so you know immunity doctrine at the Supreme Court. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3390.54s)]
*  What do you make of this cert petition denial? Yeah, I'm the only person I think in the universe [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3395.5s)]
*  has written a brief that's defeated a claim of presidential immunity. Nothing, I think. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3400.62s)]
*  And it's, you know, I think today's order is not a big deal. I see a lot of people, their hair [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3405.02s)]
*  is on fire. They can just douse their hair in water because this isn't a big deal. I don't think [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3411.26s)]
*  it's really going to affect the trial date that much. The worst case is the trial gets pushed to [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3416.94s)]
*  the summer. And the reason is I think this order shows the weakness of Trump's immunity case. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3421.6600000000003s)]
*  And I think the court realizes it's got the D.C. circuit that's going to basically, it's going to [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3429.0200000000004s)]
*  hear argument on January 9th. It's not a hard case. I think they're going to move very quickly. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3434.38s)]
*  If I were the presiding judge of the panel, I'd already be writing the opinion. And once they rule, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3438.62s)]
*  they can lift the stay. They can issue a mandate and list the stay, which means [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3443.42s)]
*  then you're going to have Donald Trump saying, oh, we need an expedition. We need an expedition. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3447.2599999999998s)]
*  And the Supreme Court could grant that and hear the case. They could hear it in April and May, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3451.1s)]
*  decide it in June, decide it in May, and still have a summer trial. Or, better yet, they could [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3454.7799999999997s)]
*  deny the case cert because he's already had his argument in the court of appeals before a very, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3460.7s)]
*  very distinguished panel. And he can, Donald Trump should be, frankly, treated like every other [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3466.06s)]
*  criminal who's been convicted in a federal district court and be forced to litigate his arguments [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3471.98s)]
*  after his conviction. And he can challenge his conviction with every other claim after he's [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3477.74s)]
*  convicted and sentenced. So I just don't think this is a big deal. I think this case is going [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3483.98s)]
*  to get tried one way or the other in April, May, June, July. This case is going to trial, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3487.82s)]
*  and Donald Trump is not going to be able to stop it. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3493.42s)]
*  That's interesting. I mean, there's a few things, Lisa, that are interesting to me. One, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3495.66s)]
*  Andrew Weissman talked about just sort of professional courtesy and deference from the [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3500.94s)]
*  Supreme Court to the D.C. Circuit, which, of course, is sort of the first among equals in [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3504.7000000000003s)]
*  the valid courts. It's sitting right there in D.C. So there's that. There's the advantage of, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3509.26s)]
*  to George's point, what I think is interesting is when you've got something that is pretty clear-cut, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3513.66s)]
*  rather than having one quite clear-cut opinion in which Judge Chuckin says, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3517.5s)]
*  not a tough call, to have two opinions that say, this is not a tough call, and then take that. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3522.62s)]
*  What do you think? Look, Chris, to the extent that the Trump brief was persuasive here, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3529.42s)]
*  I think it was persuasive on the point that Judge Chuckin's opinion denying immunity for [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3535.9s)]
*  criminal prosecution where you're talking about a sitting or former president is the first of its [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3541.42s)]
*  kind. And Trump's brief argued, you, Supreme Court, should want to have another body of law [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3546.22s)]
*  before you, before you make this most important of decisions. We're not disagreeing that this [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3551.74s)]
*  eventually warrants a review. We're just saying not now. And I thought that was probably the most [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3556.7799999999997s)]
*  persuasive argument in their brief. In terms of what I think the D.C. Circuit is going to do, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3561.2599999999998s)]
*  I tend to think that this D.C. Circuit is going to make a decision on immunity that's more symmetrical [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3566.8599999999997s)]
*  with the rule in civil cases and say, yes, maybe a president is entitled to immunity where you're [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3572.14s)]
*  talking about allegedly criminal actions at the outer periphery of their official duties. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3578.3799999999997s)]
*  But based on the allegations in this indictment, taking them on their face, what they are alleging [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3583.8199999999997s)]
*  that he did doesn't even get close to that periphery, and therefore the case can be tried. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3589.5s)]
*  I think they want the cover of a D.C. Circuit opinion that says that based on a decision [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3593.98s)]
*  earlier this month in a civil context in the D.C. Circuit, I think the D.C. Circuit is well [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3598.94s)]
*  positioned to extend that rule to the criminal context and give the court the cover that it needs. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3603.98s)]
*  Yeah, this is the outer perimeter sort of doctrine that is both sort of, I think, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3609.26s)]
*  suggested by other cases in this line and also explicitly invoked in the Trump brief. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3613.66s)]
*  George, let's talk about what's coming out of Michigan, because there's a few things striking [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3620.62s)]
*  about it to me. One is that, I don't know, where did they get the tape from? And now we've got the [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3624.94s)]
*  tape. But also just like, it's so wild how in the weeds the guy was. I mean, that's the president of [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3628.62s)]
*  the United States. Like, you know this because you have worked, you've worked in politics and you've [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3635.26s)]
*  been around the various layers that go around principles, as they're often called, right? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3639.34s)]
*  Who they talk to on the phone, what's a staff job, what's the principal's job? Like, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3646.38s)]
*  the president on the phone with the winged cameras, it's just like there's nothing he won't do. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3651.18s)]
*  There's no links he won't go to to get this done. Yeah, I mean, he's a complete nut job. And [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3656.9399999999996s)]
*  it's just like what he did in Georgia. Remember, he didn't just call Secretary of State [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3663.66s)]
*  Raffensperger. He called an investigator, a lowly investigator in the Georgia Department of whatever. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3668.54s)]
*  I didn't even know what it is. And to jawbone that poor woman, she's getting talking to the [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3676.86s)]
*  president of the United States nut job. And so, you know, it's just crazy. It just shows you what [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3682.3s)]
*  a lunatic he is and how extreme he is and how corrupt he is. Because this is just, he's basically [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3687.58s)]
*  on the basis of lies, on the basis of no facts. He's urging a public official to basically violate [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3692.7000000000003s)]
*  their oath to the law of the state of Michigan and to the constitution. It's crazy and corrupt. And [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3699.26s)]
*  I got to say this about my former political party. You know, I mean, Ron Romney McDaniel, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3705.1s)]
*  the woman who changed her name so that wouldn't displease Donald Trump. I mean, I mean, this is [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3710.2999999999997s)]
*  just the sleaziest thing ever. Whether or not it's criminal, we'll set that aside. It's just the [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3716.22s)]
*  sleaziest thing ever. And if my former political party had any decency or shame, she'd be out on [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3719.98s)]
*  her ass. Forgive my language. Yeah, yeah, it is. I do find it actually quite revealing and shocking. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3727.18s)]
*  She's on the call and she's saying, we'll pay for your lawyers as well. There's also an interesting [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3735.82s)]
*  angle to this, Lisa, which is we have seen, and I think this is sort of a little bit of a Fonny [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3739.58s)]
*  Willis effect, which is, you know, all eyes were on the Justice Department from the beginning of [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3744.78s)]
*  this. But it's pretty clear that there are all sorts of colorable claims in a bunch of jurisdictions [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3750.22s)]
*  that state law was violated. And now we've seen cases brought against, you know, the sort of fake [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3755.98s)]
*  electors in Michigan. There's a case now in Nevada. There's maybe one coming in Arizona. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3761.18s)]
*  There is the one in Georgia that names them. There were, alongside with the federal case and [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3766.54s)]
*  the Fonny Willis case, there were many state laws that plausibly were broken in pursuit of this [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3771.66s)]
*  scheme. That's absolutely true. And we now know, Chris, based on this reporting, that there were [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3777.9s)]
*  at least four recorded calls. There are the two calls that George was mentioning earlier in Georgia [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3784.7799999999997s)]
*  to Brad Raffensperger and the woman who was the investigator. Her name is Frances Watson. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3790.14s)]
*  Then there was the call that just got reported in Michigan. And I also want to remind you that [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3794.3799999999997s)]
*  there was a fourth call to now deceased Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, who provided a copy [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3798.22s)]
*  of that recording to the special purpose grand jury that Fonny Willis convened. So we now know [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3803.98s)]
*  that this guy who infamously doesn't text, doesn't email, was foiled by the smartphone era and by a [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3808.7s)]
*  bunch of quick thinking folks who, when he made these very granular, weedy calls to the Wayne [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3815.5s)]
*  County commissioners, fired up the phone and fired the otter, I guess, to record him having [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3820.14s)]
*  these conversations, giving rise to, as you note, potentially some state law claims, but also [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3825.82s)]
*  additional evidence of the wrongdoing in Jack Smith's case. Yes. Also, you're firing up the [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3831.58s)]
*  recorder, the iPhone recorder, not because you're like, this is a cool souvenir. You're firing it up [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3838.14s)]
*  as Brad Raffensperger, because like, this is really legally objectionable. And I immediately need [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3844.78s)]
*  some evidence to cover myself from what might be a blatant act of criminality. I think that's fairly [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3851.02s)]
*  clear. If I were going into a phone call with a criminal, I would record it too. And let me, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3857.34s)]
*  there's one other thing too. I mean, we forget about the one other call, the one that almost [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3863.26s)]
*  happened. Remember Governor Doug Ducey, when he was signing the electoral certificates, he's sitting [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3867.34s)]
*  there, the press is there, they're taking the pictures and all of a sudden his phone rings in [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3873.66s)]
*  his pocket. It's hail to the chief. He takes his phone out of his pocket and puts it down and turns [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3878.8599999999997s)]
*  it off. I mean, Trump is completely insane. I forgot that detail. And one thing about the state [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3884.46s)]
*  laws, I mean, you know, here it's, I think the one wrinkle to this particular case, I think if I [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3892.3799999999997s)]
*  were the defense lawyers here for Ronna, Romney, McDaniel and Donald Trump and whoever, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3898.3s)]
*  the thing they got going for them is that these people had already certified the results. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3904.1400000000003s)]
*  They'd already done it, yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3909.02s)]
*  And they didn't have the power to uncertify it. So in a sense, they were being asked to do something [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3909.5800000000004s)]
*  they couldn't do. And that may have, that could affect the legal, a legal effect of what they did. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3915.1800000000003s)]
*  And, but other than that, it's just sleazy, sleazy as hell. And it can be used in Jack Smith's case, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3920.38s)]
*  which I think can go to trial in March and April, as I said, and in, and in Fonny Willis's case to [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3926.7s)]
*  show their criminal intent. Lisa Rubin, George Conway, thank you both so much on this pre-Holiday [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3931.58s)]
*  Friday. I really appreciate it. Have a great break if you get one. Thank you. Up next, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3938.14s)]
*  the good economic news keeps rolling out for Joe Biden, but what do voters think? We'll explore that [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3942.14s)]
*  next. How's the economy really doing? Well, yesterday, the Biden-Harris campaign took to [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3948.7s)]
*  social media to post a sunny outlook from, of all places, Fox Business. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3959.1s)]
*  I'm excited, Larry. We got the juice in printing money. We've got the Fed slowing down. We've got [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3964.2999999999997s)]
*  the soft landing. We've got broadening of the S&P 500 and the S&P 500. And obviously the Russell [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3971.1s)]
*  2000. This is a fantastic holiday season. Rudolph the reindeer has arrived. I mean, he's not wrong. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3978.06s)]
*  New federal data out today shows consumer prices fell last month. They fell. They went down. Not [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3986.86s)]
*  that the rate of increase was slower. They fell for the first time since 2020. Inflation is down [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3992.7799999999997s)]
*  near the Fed's target rate of 2%. And incomes, spending, and crucially, consumer confidence [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=3998.62s)]
*  are all rising. And yet, as we know, that's not how most Americans say they are feeling about the [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4005.26s)]
*  economy. According to a new poll out this week from the Atlantic, just 20% of Americans think [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4011.5s)]
*  the economy has improved this year versus 44% who say it's gotten worse. And again, that's not an [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4016.2200000000003s)]
*  outlier. People have been telling pollsters basically the same thing all year. As senior [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4022.0600000000004s)]
*  editor Gilad Edelman writes in the Atlantic, the economy is hot, but people are bothered. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4026.0600000000004s)]
*  Why the disconnect? Well, according to that poll, Edelman writes, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4031.74s)]
*  it's the English muffin problem. Grocery prices are still higher than their pre-pandemic levels, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4034.46s)]
*  and groceries are one of the things that people are most upset about. Edelman added a personal [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4040.2999999999997s)]
*  note. Earlier in the pandemic, I recall a six-pack of Thomas English muffins costing about $3.50 at [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4044.46s)]
*  the time. Today, one costs $5.59. Just a vibe, maybe, but it's a common one. Despite all the [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4049.9s)]
*  leading economic indicators, shoppers are still saying the vibes are bad. Gilad Edelman, the [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4056.14s)]
*  Atlantic senior editor and English muffin aficionado joins me now. Gilad, I liked it [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4062.2999999999997s)]
*  because you really focused on trying to use this polling and the responses to it to go through a [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4067.18s)]
*  bunch of different possible theories for the disconnect. One of the things you say that's [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4074.7s)]
*  really interesting is there's a theory, and it's one that I've actually often considered, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4078.2999999999997s)]
*  that the huge increase in income assistance that happened during COVID, which we know from the data [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4083.34s)]
*  really helped people's balance sheets, the amount of median household wealth and how much debt, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4089.5s)]
*  it really helped folks, that that going away is the source of some people's frustration. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4094.38s)]
*  But your polling suggests that that's not really what's going on. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4099.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem to. These things are really hard to test definitively because [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4104.7s)]
*  people's memories might not match up with what they actually experience. But for what it's worth, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4109.1s)]
*  we asked people, would you say you were doing better financially before the pandemic, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4112.7s)]
*  during the pandemic, or now? And very few people said during the pandemic. Most people said they [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4117.66s)]
*  were doing better before, and a good chunk said they're doing better now, actually. But almost [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4123.0199999999995s)]
*  nobody said during. And that's not what you would expect if the reason everybody is so upset is [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4128.0599999999995s)]
*  that they got so used to those government benefits. And then one of the things that really [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4134.46s)]
*  emerges when you talk about prices, one of the other things people talked about is housing prices. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4139.58s)]
*  And we've really seen, I mean, this is a place where the data we've seen, particularly rent, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4143.98s)]
*  has really, really skyrocketed in a lot of places. It's now starting to come down, but it's just [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4148.94s)]
*  unambiguously the case that it's created a lot of pressure on folks, particularly people [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4153.82s)]
*  in large metro areas that are renting. But again, you say in your poll, that's not leaping out as [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4158.14s)]
*  the thing that most voters are focusing on when they're talking about the economy and particularly [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4164.62s)]
*  prices. Yeah, and I thought it would be because if you go back to 2020, that's when the economic [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4169.1s)]
*  indicators and public opinion really started to separate. They both crashed when the pandemic [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4177.740000000001s)]
*  started, but then as the economy recovered, people's impressions of it didn't really. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4182.780000000001s)]
*  And one thing that really changed going back to the pandemic was that the cost of housing, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4187.1s)]
*  both rent and home sales, got so much more expensive even than inflation overall. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4193.5s)]
*  But then when you think about it, first of all, most people in America own their homes, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4198.22s)]
*  or most people live in a household that owns its home. And that means that as home prices go up, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4201.740000000001s)]
*  those people are actually getting wealthier. So a lot of economic numbers are like this, where [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4207.1s)]
*  it's not good or bad. It's good for some people and it's bad for some other people. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4212.46s)]
*  And with home prices and rent, the group that it's bad for is probably smaller than the group [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4216.46s)]
*  that it's good for. And grocery is the opposite of that. The group for whom it's bad to have to pay [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4222.7s)]
*  more for groceries is almost everybody. And the group for whom it's good is a very small number [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4227.5s)]
*  of corporations that make more money when they can sell groceries for more money. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4233.66s)]
*  Yeah. So you say that groceries ends up coming up a lot and really looming large. And there's [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4237.9s)]
*  a few reasons to think that's true. One is that grocery prices actually were up higher than [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4242.38s)]
*  regular inflation. So they really went up quite a bit, way more. People had that experience, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4247.58s)]
*  along with gas, those are probably the two things people consume the most. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4254.78s)]
*  While gas has gone up and then come down, groceries have just sort of gone up, even if the [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4257.66s)]
*  rate of it increased. What does the data say about how large groceries do loom in people's minds and [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4261.58s)]
*  how they're thinking about the economy? In our poll, groceries blew away the competition. So [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4268.9400000000005s)]
*  when we asked people first, has the economy gotten better or worse? And then we followed up with a [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4274.860000000001s)]
*  couple of different questions asking, what factors were you thinking about when you made that judgment? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4280.9400000000005s)]
*  And 29% of people picked the price of groceries, which was the highest. And other things that you [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4286.38s)]
*  might have expected, like gas or housing, were in the single digits. And even that 29% is kind of [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4292.219999999999s)]
*  understating it because inflation was just an option on the poll. But obviously, a lot of those [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4298.62s)]
*  people, if inflation hadn't been there, would have chosen groceries. And indeed, when we asked people [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4305.179999999999s)]
*  to pick their second factor, a huge percentage of the people who had chosen inflation then chose [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4309.82s)]
*  groceries. So it really seems, from the poll, like not surprisingly, people are upset about costs. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4315.02s)]
*  And when you drill down into that, the cost that at the moment looms largest for most people appears [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4321.9800000000005s)]
*  to be groceries. And one of the things I think that's promising in terms of that is that a lot [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4327.34s)]
*  of those prices are coming down. We've seen it in some specific things like eggs. We've seen it in [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4333.02s)]
*  turkeys around Christmas time. We're seeing in the overall inflation rate and also the consumer [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4336.780000000001s)]
*  confidence going up. And I think if we revisit this exact debate in six months, my prediction, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4341.02s)]
*  we'll see. But my prediction is the answer to the question of why is there a gap is a lag, basically. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4346.06s)]
*  And if we continue on this trajectory in six months, you're going to see those numbers come [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4353.02s)]
*  up. We'll see. Maybe we'll have you back, Eli Edelman, in six months to see if I'm right. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4356.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's the big question. Nobody knows how long that lag is going to take. We seem [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4362.540000000001s)]
*  to be recovering, but people are not happy with prices where they are. So it's anybody's guess as [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4368.06s)]
*  to how long it's going to take for that to feel normal. All right. Eli Edelman of The Atlantic. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4373.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. Up next, The Stakes of 2024 with Donald Trump as a front runner, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4377.820000000001s)]
*  Michael Beschloss and Jelani Cobb join me after this quick break. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4381.740000000001s)]
*  So just a few hours ago, Donald Trump got one bit of relatively good news from the Supreme Court, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4393.580000000001s)]
*  at least for now. The justices issued a one page order refusing to weigh in just yet on his [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4397.74s)]
*  presidential immunity defense in his federal January 6th prosecution. He now has until January [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4403.099999999999s)]
*  9th when the DC Circuit Court will hear arguments in that case. The Supreme Court is also widely [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4408.219999999999s)]
*  expected to take up an appeal of the Colorado case on whether that state can bar him from the ballot [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4413.42s)]
*  for being insurrectionist. That decision could also be issued soon with just 24 days left until [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4418.46s)]
*  voters begin gathering for the Iowa caucus, which is on January 15th. Jelani Cobb is a staff writer [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4423.58s)]
*  for The New Yorker, Dean of the Columbia Journalism School. Michael Beschloss is the NBC News [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4430.54s)]
*  presidential historian, and they join me now. Mike, I want to ask you about this section three of [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4435.18s)]
*  the 14th Amendment question and the sort of debate over it. And I think there are some interesting, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4442.38s)]
*  there's certainly novel legal issues. Just your perspective as a historian on this moment and [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4448.86s)]
*  this question now before the high court, in some ways before the country about [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4456.0599999999995s)]
*  what to do about what appears to be a plain text that puts him outside of the [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4460.54s)]
*  boundaries of acceptable candidates basically to hold office and the sort of democratic imperative [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4467.259999999999s)]
*  to let voters choose. Yeah, that's what I think. I mean, if you just read that language, it says, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4472.94s)]
*  you know, people who are engaged in insurrection or rebellion shall not serve in federal office. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4480.299999999999s)]
*  And then you go back to the debate in Congress at the time that amendment was discussed. They were [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4486.94s)]
*  very specifically essentially saying, this is my language, not theirs, that for four years there [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4492.78s)]
*  was a violent insurrection against the United States of America, our union of states, that was [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4498.3s)]
*  put down. They wanted to make sure that anyone who had abetted or engaged in that struggle would not [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4504.9400000000005s)]
*  serve in federal office. Is the presidency of federal office? Well, you know, JFK, for instance, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4512.14s)]
*  in 1961 after the Bay of Pigs failure said, and I quote, I'm the responsible officer of the government, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4517.900000000001s)]
*  and that is quite obvious. Now, JFK was not the Supreme Court, but anyone who would like to argue [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4526.780000000001s)]
*  that the president of the United States is not a federal officer, I'd love to hear that argued, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4532.54s)]
*  don't think it's going to go too far. You know, Chris, can I add something here? Go ahead, please. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4537.58s)]
*  Yeah. You know, one of the things I think is really important to bear in mind here is that, you know, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4544.3s)]
*  we've had these conversations around democracy. We've been having these conversations around [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4550.54s)]
*  democracy for years now. To Michael's point, we really have to emphasize that the primary concern [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4554.38s)]
*  of the politics and the aftermath of the Civil War was to make sure that the government of the [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4564.22s)]
*  United States could never be imperiled again in the way that it had been for the four years of [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4569.58s)]
*  the Civil War. That is what the 13th Amendment is about. That is what the 14th Amendment is about. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4575.02s)]
*  That is what the 15th Amendment is about. They're all concerned, ultimately, with the preservation [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4579.9s)]
*  of democracy in this way. And it really becomes a question of how literally you want to take the [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4585.74s)]
*  literal words of the 14th Amendment. Yeah. And I think there's also a historical context that's [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4592.46s)]
*  also important just to stay with this point for a second, Michael, come back to you on this, which is [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4599.42s)]
*  those fears that are embodied in the 13th and 14th and 15th Amendment are almost immediately [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4604.62s)]
*  realized because what happens is, ultimately, they're essentially overturned in practice. I mean, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4610.86s)]
*  they are almost every aspect of all three of those. I mean, slavery is not quite reinstituted, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4617.9s)]
*  but sharecropping comes extremely close. Like the guarantee of equal protection and voting rights [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4623.5s)]
*  are basically torn asunder. In fact, former Confederate officers come back into power [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4628.86s)]
*  to supervise the creation of essentially an authoritarian regime in the South. So, Michael, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4634.7s)]
*  that concern, it's not just that the concern's there and it's in the Constitution. It's actually [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4641.259999999999s)]
*  that the concern was then promptly borne out in our history when that movement was allowed to sort [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4645.66s)]
*  of reform itself. Right. This is not what a psychologist would call a free-floating [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4651.74s)]
*  anxiety. This is something that not only did Congress and the United States try to prevent, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4657.74s)]
*  but they failed. So, are we going to fail again? The whole point is, in the mid-1860s, not only [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4663.5s)]
*  was an insurrection by the South turned back, the president of the United States was assassinated [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4671.82s)]
*  by Confederate traitors. Why wouldn't they try to make sure that that wasn't going to happen again [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4678.54s)]
*  by the same people? So, in our own generation, why should not the 14th Amendment be applied, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4684.3s)]
*  as Richard Nixon would say, and in this case, I agree with him, as a strict constructionist would? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4692.14s)]
*  And, Jelani, this question of this before the Court, I mean, the Court now is going to have [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4700.860000000001s)]
*  these monumental decisions before it, decisions that will mean that even if it fails to decide, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4704.54s)]
*  they are deciding. And this is another place where this sort of question about democracy and [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4710.06s)]
*  our institutions, the sort of three acts of government, the three branches of government [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4715.820000000001s)]
*  and checks and balances comes to the fore in terms of how to think about the legitimacy of the Court, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4719.9800000000005s)]
*  what kind of democratic points of civic pressure and engagement are proper or improper vis-a-vis a [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4725.42s)]
*  Court that can do some things that would be wildly dangerous, I think, to the fate of the Republic. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4732.700000000001s)]
*  Sure. I mean, there are a few things at play here. One is that kind of baseline lack of civic [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4738.7s)]
*  understanding. So, the 14th Amendment is explicit and clear in its prescriptions. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4745.0199999999995s)]
*  Were the Supreme Court to come down and say that Colorado was within its rights [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4751.42s)]
*  to determine who was on its ballot and whether or not that violates the prescriptions of the [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4756.86s)]
*  14th Amendment, that would have an enormous impact. We're already seeing violent rhetoric [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4761.98s)]
*  ricocheting around on the internet in response to the Colorado decision. Unfortunately, most people [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4769.74s)]
*  don't know, most of the people engaged in that don't know that both of these things are [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4776.379999999999s)]
*  constitutionally permissible. And so that's the first part of it. The second part of it is that [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4780.86s)]
*  the multi-generational at this point, war on the legitimacy of government, the kind of superheated [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4789.099999999999s)]
*  rhetoric, the kinds of things that we heard going even all the way back to the mid-1990s and the [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4798.219999999999s)]
*  concerns we had then around domestic violence and insurrection and so on, that really matters. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4807.339999999999s)]
*  We've kind of found ourselves or pushed ourselves to this precipice where by simply following the [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4815.74s)]
*  mandates of the Constitution, we might actually find ourselves in a broader democratic crisis. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4821.1s)]
*  Right. Michael, there's also, as we head towards this primary season, this question of [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4828.22s)]
*  whether we're going to see a contested primary election. And I think the odds have been no, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4836.7s)]
*  but there's some polling in New Hampshire suggests maybe not completely impossible. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4843.26s)]
*  And one thing I do try to keep reminding myself is that presidential politics can surprise, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4848.780000000001s)]
*  that people can actually come out of nowhere, the people that are left for dead, metaphorically [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4855.5s)]
*  speaking, in terms of their prospects can come back. And I've seen that happen multiple times [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4860.14s)]
*  just in my career as a journalist covering it. And as someone who's studied this for the years, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4866.860000000001s)]
*  your thoughts on that? It can, but changes in our political system in the last couple of decades [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4871.9s)]
*  have made this much harder. For instance, Chris, when in American history have you seen a situation [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4880.62s)]
*  like with Donald Trump, where he basically owns the Republican National Committee and is spending [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4887.0199999999995s)]
*  its money at the same time as this is supposedly a fair fight between him and Nikki Haley and these [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4892.78s)]
*  others? We have never seen anything like this before. When in American history have we seen [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4899.18s)]
*  this kind of money being raised and go into a campaign from all sorts of sources that perhaps [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4904.14s)]
*  before Citizens United would have been illegal? This is not something we've seen before either. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4910.46s)]
*  I would make the point, we've got a brilliant system. And by the way, what Jelani said, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4915.900000000001s)]
*  he said beautifully, as he always does, and I align myself with what he said. It's a beautiful [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4920.780000000001s)]
*  system, but not when both hands are tied behind its back. And that's what's happened in the last [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4926.94s)]
*  couple of decades. I am sorry to report. All right, Jelani Cobb, Michael Barschloss, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4933.179999999999s)]
*  many thanks to both of you on this pre-Holiday Friday. I hope you have a great break if you get [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4939.419999999999s)]
*  one. Thank you very much. You too. You too. Thank you. We'll be right back. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4943.58s)]
*  If I had the NBA draft of like fascists, autocrats, and I was like running them through, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4948.3s)]
*  you know, the paces, like I don't know in the end what makes someone work, it work for someone and [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4958.54s)]
*  not for someone else. I total, this is a very unpopular opinion, but I do not believe that the [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4964.78s)]
*  leader matters. You need a country that is looking for an authoritarian solution. And you need [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4971.9800000000005s)]
*  people who are willing to submit themselves to the authority of the person who says they deserve it. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4978.3s)]
*  And so you've got like Franco was Napoleon sized, right? Like Hitler was a dork, right? Mussolini [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4984.62s)]
*  was a journalist and a socialist. Like there's nothing about these guys that is inherently, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4993.02s)]
*  that transformed those countries against their will. Those countries were subject to an [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=4997.900000000001s)]
*  anti-democratic pro-authoritarian movement that had skills and the people were ready to do it. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5005.58s)]
*  I've been thinking a lot about my conversation with Rachel Maddow last month at the culmination [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5013.98s)]
*  of the live recordings of my podcast, Why Is This Happening? We spent hours talking about the threat [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5018.22s)]
*  of fascism in America, past and present, what it takes to keep our democracy and our Republic. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5023.42s)]
*  You can scan the QR code on your screen to get a link to the podcast or find it wherever you [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5028.7s)]
*  get your podcasts. And while you're there, check out some of the other truly fascinating conversations [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5035.26s)]
*  I had this year on everything from the Supreme Court to the rise in right-wing extremism to [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5041.5s)]
*  the future of AI to the origins of the universe. That's a particularly good one if you've got your [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5047.9800000000005s)]
*  phone up right now. I learned a lot. I hope you will too. So that is it for this special edition [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5052.22s)]
*  of All In. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovTOWAsVsGA&t=5058.54s)]
