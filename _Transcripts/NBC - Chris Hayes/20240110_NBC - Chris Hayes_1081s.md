# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. History made in front of the entire country today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=0.0s)]
*  At least we could all hear it if not see it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=5.0s)]
*  Less than one week before the Iowa caucus, the man who's poised to win the Republican nomination [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=8.0s)]
*  sat in court while his lawyers attempted a last-minute effort to get the ex-president's criminal charges thrown out on immunity grounds. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=12.0s)]
*  In Donald Trump's federal election interference trial, one of the last chances to hold him accountable for the crimes of January 6th [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=21.0s)]
*  before the upcoming election, his lawyers stood before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, probably the second most important court in all the land, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=27.0s)]
*  and before the nation and those three judges argued that a president can effectively do whatever he wants, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=35.0s)]
*  no matter how malevolent, without any legal consequences. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=43.0s)]
*  To authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora's box from which this nation may never recover. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=48.0s)]
*  Bill, can I explore sort of the implications of what you're arguing? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=57.0s)]
*  I understand your position to be that a president is immune from criminal prosecution for any official act that he takes as president, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=63.0s)]
*  even if that action is taken for an unlawful or unconstitutional purpose. Is that correct? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=72.0s)]
*  With an important exception, which is that if the president is impeached and convicted by the United States Senate in a, you know, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=77.0s)]
*  proceeding that reflects widespread political consensus. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=84.0s)]
*  Okay, so there you have it, in case you weren't tracking. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=88.0s)]
*  So the official position of Donald Trump is that as long as he or any president can hold on to 35 votes in the Senate to avoid an impeachment conviction, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=91.0s)]
*  there can be no, as a matter of constitutional bedrock American law, there can be no criminal accountability for anything he does, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=102.0s)]
*  no matter how violent or evil, even as his lawyer was forced to concede having his political opponents murdered. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=112.0s)]
*  Could a president order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? That's an official act in order to SEAL Team 6. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=121.0s)]
*  He would have to be and would speedily be, you know, impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=129.0s)]
*  But if you weren't, there would be no criminal prosecution, no criminal liability for that? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=135.0s)]
*  Chief Justice's opinion in Marlborough against Madison and our constitutional tradition and the plain language of the impeachment judgment clause all clearly presuppose that what the founders were concerned about was not. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=140.0s)]
*  I asked you a yes or no question. Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not impeached, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=153.0s)]
*  would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=162.0s)]
*  If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=165.0s)]
*  So your answer is no. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=168.0s)]
*  My answer is qualified, yes. There is a political process that would have to occur under the structure of our constitution, which would require impeachment and conviction by the Senate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=170.0s)]
*  Again, all you got to do is hold on to 35 votes. You hold on to 35 votes in the Senate and you can have your political opponents murdered. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=178.0s)]
*  You can have anyone murdered. You could do whatever you want. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=187.0s)]
*  You got 35 votes in the Senate and there is nothing anyone can do anywhere in this country under the structure they say of the Constitution. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=190.0s)]
*  They are not trying to hide it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=199.0s)]
*  Trump's argument is some of the most breathtaking, aggressive public articulation of a vision of American dictatorship as we have ever seen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=202.0s)]
*  And I want to be clear here. I mean, it's obvious, but it's worth stressing this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=210.0s)]
*  This was not being made in a fundraising email by like a low level staffer, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=215.0s)]
*  It was not an off the cuff answer on a tarmac. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=220.0s)]
*  It was not a campaign speech at a rally where he goes off the teleprompter playing to the crowd. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=223.0s)]
*  This was the considered argument of the lawyer for the man who wants to wield the office of the presidency again. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=228.0s)]
*  Thankfully, the three judges seemed appropriately skeptical of Trump's arguments. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=237.0s)]
*  All of your other arguments seem to fall away. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=244.0s)]
*  Your separation of powers arguments fall away. Your policy arguments fall away. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=247.0s)]
*  If you concede that a president can be criminally prosecuted under some circumstances, even under Clinton, where there's a deal cut under President Nixon, where there's pardon given, there's an assumption that you could be prosecuted because why enter into those particular acts? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=251.0s)]
*  I think it's paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal laws. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=270.0s)]
*  Yes, Judge, respectfully. I agree. I do think it's paradoxical. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=285.0s)]
*  Now, the lawyer for special counsel Jack Smith's office did an admirable job both outlining how ridiculous the ever shifting legal argument from Trump is and also, again, to reiterate the very dire consequences that could follow from this preposterous theory of presidential immunity if adopted. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=291.0s)]
*  In the defendant's theory over the course of the litigation has evolved a bit, and I think now before this court, I understand the arguments to be principally sort of the principal submission to be, as you've just described, this what we call in our brief the conditioned precedent argument that there is only liability, criminal liability for a former president if that president has been impeached and convicted. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=310.0s)]
*  And that is wrong for textual, structural, historical reasons and a host of practical ones, one of which I'll start with again to just amplify the point. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=333.0s)]
*  It would mean that if a former president engages in assassination, selling pardons, these kinds of things, and then isn't impeached and convicted, there is no accountability for that individual, and that is frightening. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=344.0s)]
*  The lawyer from Smith's office also noted that while the criminal prosecution of a former president is unprecedented, so were Trump's crimes against American democracy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=361.0s)]
*  Never before has there been allegations that a sitting president has, with private individuals and using the levers of power, sought to fundamentally subvert the Democratic Republic and the electoral system. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=370.0s)]
*  And frankly, if that kind of fact pattern arises again, I think it would be awfully scary if there weren't some sort of mechanism by which to reach that criminally. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=384.0s)]
*  And if you're listening to this as a non-lawyer, even if you're a lawyer who's not particularly immersed in constitutional law and the sort of line of cases about presidential immunity, I mean, just at a lay level, just as a citizen to citizen kind of thing, as fellow members of this Democratic polity, it just seems obviously the case. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=394.0s)]
*  That there has to be some kind of legal accountability, the possibility of it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=413.0s)]
*  I mean, if a former president who tried to steal an election is running for the White House again to finish the job, what self-respecting republic wouldn't have a way of defending itself against an enemy such as that? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=418.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, Donald Trump was sitting there the entire time, glowering, according to reporters in the room, the ex-president looking dour, scribbling notes to his lawyers with a sharpie during the prosecution's presentation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=432.0s)]
*  And it sounds like his message got through to them because towards the end of the same proceedings, we heard some particularly Trumpian arguments from his attorney when responding to the plain truth put forward by Jack's missed team. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=444.0s)]
*  That's not a frightening future. That's our republic. What he is forecasting is a situation where the floodgates will be open. We are in a situation where we have the prosecution of the chief political opponent who is winning in every poll. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=456.0s)]
*  That is the frightening future. That is tailor-made to launch cycles of recrimination that will shake our republic for the future. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=469.0s)]
*  Just a really classic Trumpian propagandistic lie right there, casually winning in every poll, said sort of almost as a stipulated aside that no one can rebut. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=482.0s)]
*  Trump clearly comes directly from Trump. That is the kind of thing the boss wants to hear. And he sits there while three judges weigh his potential freedom. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=492.0s)]
*  And the entire argument from his legal team, all of it today, was just about as chilling a warning as to what is at stake in this election as anything we've encountered thus far, which is saying something save for the actual bloody spectacle of January 6th. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=500.0s)]
*  Today's arguments were clearly a test. They felt like that in the moment. You could feel it. Like, is this going to hold? Are the guardrails of our democracy still in place? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=516.0s)]
*  Or is Trump going to be allowed to become the dictator he's always dreamed of being free from any legal accountability for his actions? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=526.0s)]
*  Everyone in that room today, a hazard to say, understood that fact. Everyone listening at home should as well. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=534.0s)]
*  I think the strangest argument that Donald Trump's lawyer kept making today was this notion that somehow a president who is not impeached and convicted by the Senate cannot be prosecuted. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=541.0s)]
*  Now, I got to say, as far as I can tell, this is an argument they appeared to have basically invented whole cloth in the last like 24 hours. And you can hear the skepticism from the judges. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=552.0s)]
*  I've asked you a series of hypotheticals about criminal actions that could be taken by a president and could be considered official acts and asked you, would such a president be subject to criminal prosecution if he's not impeached or convicted? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=564.0s)]
*  And your answer, your yes or no answer is no. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=582.0s)]
*  I believe I said qualified yes if he's impeached or convicted first. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=585.0s)]
*  Okay, so he's not impeached or convicted. Let's put that aside. You're saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=588.0s)]
*  Okay, so the argument, you're trying, the argument that Trump's lawyer came back to time and time again was that the only way that you could, under the Constitution, prosecute a hypothetical president for doing all those hypothetical crimes would be if first, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=602.0s)]
*  while he was president, he was impeached and convicted by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Now there are a bunch of reasons why the argument is ludicrous, not the least of which is that when the ex-president was being impeached the second time, one of the arguments made for acquittal was that impeachment wasn't the right venue. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=617.0s)]
*  Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell argued at length it wasn't the Senate's job to hold Trump accountable. That's what prosecutors and courts are for. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=635.0s)]
*  President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office. Didn't get away with anything yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=645.0s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is a former litigator, now an MSNBC legal analyst. Charles Coleman prosecuted civil cases on behalf of the U.S. government. He's now a civil rights and criminal defense attorney. They both join me now. Great to have you here. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=663.0s)]
*  Okay. First, just give me your first read on the centrality of this argument. The you have to impeach and convict first argument as it appeared today, which I was not anticipating to be as central as it was. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=674.0s)]
*  Well, that's because it's not the first line argument, right? The argument that they're making on presidential immunity starts with the overarching he's immune from everything because of the structure of the Constitution and separation of powers principles. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=687.0s)]
*  This was their sort of like second line. Correct. Yes. The impeachment judgment clause of Article One of the Constitution, which is really intended to be a limit on the Senate. And essentially what it says is if you impeach and convict someone, the penalties that you can impose upon them are disqualification from holding office and removal from office and nothing further. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=700.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, nothing should prevent that person from also being liable in a court of law. There's nothing in that text that says anything about what avenues of relief are open, for example, to the Department of Justice, which is not addressed in Article One. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=723.0s)]
*  This is meant as a constraint on Congress, not a get out of jail free card for a former president. And in that way, Chris, they sort of back their way into this argument. Very much so. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=738.0s)]
*  It was like, oh, now I'm here. What am I doing? Because as Lisa said, this is a clause in the Constitution that is supposed to limit Congress, limit the Senate, not give the president more power. However, one of the things that I have found so interesting about this entire ordeal was I've been wondering going into today, where are they going to create an actual constitutional question that could potentially make its way to the high court? They didn't do it. I was I was looking at the Constitution. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=748.0s)]
*  I was looking to see whether in pushing on the separation of powers issue, they would create enough controversy that it might pose a legitimate question for the Supreme Court. I don't think that they did that. So here's what I think a very smart lawyer I talked to about this today made this point, which which was clarifying for me because I was like, what's up with all the impeachment stuff? And she said, look, it's a fallback position, right? Because what they actually want to argue what they've argued in the briefs is you can't do anything. Right? If it's an official act, then you can't do anything. Right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=775.0s)]
*  If it's an official act, tough, tough luck, buddy, which means if he sells SEAL Team 6 to go assassinate his political rival. Now, they couldn't argue because it's so ludicrous. So now they've got this this fallback impeachment position. I just want to it's just worth playing because this is a classic Trump thing. Like in one venue, the argument is like, well, this is the venue. And then the then you go to the other venue like, well, that's it's not the it's not the venue now. Right. They love to do this. Here's Trump's lawyer, Dirk. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=803.0s)]
*  Assuring impeachment, assuring the senators. Look, if this doesn't if this if you go to vote for convicted, he can of course go get arrested and get convicted. Take a listen. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=833.0s)]
*  If my colleagues on this side of the chamber actually think that President Trump committed a criminal offense and let's understand a high crime is a felony and a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=843.0s)]
*  The words haven't changed that much over the time. After he's out of office, you go and arrest him. There is no such thing as a January exception to impeachment. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=855.0s)]
*  There is only the text of the Constitution, which makes very clear that a former president is subject to criminal sanction after his presidency for any illegal acts he commits. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=865.0s)]
*  That's Donald Trump's lawyer at the impeachment hearing, making literally the opposite argument that his lawyer made today before these judges. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=880.0s)]
*  Yes. And one of the reasons it's also specious is because this impeachment judgment clause, it doesn't just apply to presidents. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=889.0s)]
*  It applies to anybody who could be impeached by the House and Senate. That means former federal judges, for example, or cabinet secretaries. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=897.0s)]
*  Some of those people have been prosecuted and convicted without impeachment. Hello, Henry Cisneros, the former HUD secretary. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=904.0s)]
*  And there are a litany of federal judges who have been prosecuted and convicted either without impeachment or before they're impeached. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=911.0s)]
*  So Trump's lawyers had to have known that during the impeachment debacle that you just showed there. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=919.0s)]
*  They understand full well that the impeachment judgment clause isn't just about the president and those real life examples show why it can't possibly be victorious here. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=925.0s)]
*  I guess the question for you, right? So I thought when the impeachment thing showed up in the brief, right? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=934.0s)]
*  So in their brief, they had this again. I mean, it's a little like taking a shot from 36 feet. Like, you know, if you hit it, great. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=939.0s)]
*  But like you got to try, right? So it's like they have this thing about like it's double jeopardy because he was always already impeached and wasn't convicted. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=945.0s)]
*  And so criminal trial. And that's like that's sort of fallen by the wayside a little bit. But they've refashioned it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=951.0s)]
*  I guess my feeling was like, are they trying to come up with something novel enough that SCOTUS will take it? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=956.0s)]
*  I think it's so out of nowhere. Correct. This entire ordeal around impeachment, this entire question, this entire appeal is the shot from 36 feet. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=961.0s)]
*  It's actually the half court. It's actually the half court shot. Really? Like if it goes in at any point for any reason, you take it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=970.0s)]
*  You take it. And I think that the more that you can jam pack into that, you may get a line. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=977.0s)]
*  It might be what we refer to as dicta in an opinion that you try to sort of ride and dicta is something that a judge might say that's not necessarily germane to the case, but as part of a decision. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=982.0s)]
*  They're looking for something that they can hang their hat on some door, some avenue, some crack that they're going to be able to open that's controversial enough that they feel like it's going to generate a legitimate question for another appeal for more delay. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=991.0s)]
*  OK, can I ask you a quick question on timing that Harry teased, right? There's a back and forth about the possibility of some sort of remand. What did you make of that? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1004.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's because in the civil context, this same court recently decided an appeal with respect to three cases brought by former police officers, members of Congress who have sued Trump civilly. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1013.0s)]
*  And in that case, and find, you know, the civil rule is that a president does have immunity within the outer perimeter of his official duties. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1026.0s)]
*  Because of that, they sent it back to the lower court to determine, well, what was he doing here? Was he acting in his official capacity or some personal capacity? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1034.0s)]
*  That makes sense where you're talking about the civil rule. But here the court has to fashion a rule in the first place, right? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1042.0s)]
*  Judge Chuckin's lower court decision says there is no criminal immunity of any kind. So it's unclear whether they'll need to remand at all. And they're supposed to take these facts as true. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1048.0s)]
*  All right, Charles Coleman, Lisa Rubin, that was great. Thank you. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1059.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp-Dk0Q8DgE&t=1078.0s)]
