Video Description: Former Alabama Senator Doug Jones on Sen. Tommy Tuberville trying to walk back his comments on white nationalists: "I think he’s bending to some pressure. It’s clear that he really didn’t believe it or want to say it—he was begrudgingly trying to clarify for his colleagues sake, not his."

# ‘Embarrassing’: Ex-Alabama Senator rips Tuberville's white nationalist remarks
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4)
*  For the first time in over a hundred years, the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=0.0s)]
*  is a Marine Corps commandant, and that is because of one senator who represents roughly [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  one point five percent of the American population, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who is also on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=7.88s)]
*  the Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=12.84s)]
*  You have probably been hearing a lot about Senator Tuberville lately for insisting that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=14.6s)]
*  white nationalists are just American. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=19.16s)]
*  Tuberville has also been holding up hundreds of top military promotions because he wants [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=21.84s)]
*  to impose forced birth on every American service member and their families. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=26.4s)]
*  To be clear, abortion procedures are not covered by the Department of Defense unless the mother's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  life is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=36.72s)]
*  But after the Dobbs ruling last year, the Pentagon issued a new policy granting leave [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=40.96s)]
*  and covering travel expenses for service members in states where abortion is illegal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  And that is not a small number. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=52.44s)]
*  About 40 percent of all women in active duty or DOD civilian jobs now have limited or [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=54.48s)]
*  no access to abortions, a RAND study shows. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=59.4s)]
*  Congresswoman Mickey Sherrill, a former Navy pilot, noted this today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=63.68s)]
*  To do this because he wants to impose, Tuberville wants to impose his own, extremist views on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=68.36s)]
*  service women and military families is really unconscionable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=77.12s)]
*  Right now we have women serving across the country who have no access to quality reproductive [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=80.96s)]
*  health services. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=86.96s)]
*  We are now talking about women who are not just service women, but the families of service [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=88.08s)]
*  members who are stationed in places like Texas, which has about 120,000 active duty service [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  members. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=99.8s)]
*  Imagine that you have a high risk pregnancy in Texas right now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=100.8s)]
*  Senator Tuberville is determined to grind the American defense apparatus to a halt so [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=105.88s)]
*  he can force those women to carry pregnancies to term against their will. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=109.4s)]
*  Doug Jones, the former Democratic senator of Alabama who preceded Tuberville, now distinguished [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=114.56s)]
*  senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=121.0s)]
*  Well I guess my first question is, what do you think of what Mr. Tuberville is doing, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  the senator is doing? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=127.76s)]
*  And do you think it plays well in the state that you represented of Alabama? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=129.32s)]
*  Well I'm not sure which thing you're talking about. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Are you talking about his white nationalist views? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=136.84s)]
*  Are you talking about his military nominations? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=138.68s)]
*  Or what are we talking about? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=141.44s)]
*  There are so many things that I think that he is doing that quite frankly, Chris, is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=142.44s)]
*  just embarrassing to the state. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Even though there are so many people that might say they support it, I don't think they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=149.4s)]
*  really fully appreciate, especially on the nominations process, what he's doing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=152.58s)]
*  We've got a state that is a strong military presence, strong veteran presence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=158.68s)]
*  They understand the need to have these generals promoted to have them go up the chain, how [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=163.0s)]
*  important that is to morale. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  That's incredibly important. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=170.52s)]
*  And the thing involving the abortion policy, Chris, it's not really completely a new policy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=171.72s)]
*  in the sense that the Department of Defense has paid for people to go out of state, out [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=178.12s)]
*  of area, if it was needed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=184.0s)]
*  That's a policy that's been in effect because we've got to support our military. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=187.38s)]
*  We've got to support folks. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=191.46s)]
*  So this is nothing really new. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=192.86s)]
*  I really think that this is an attack, again, on women. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=194.76s)]
*  I don't think it likes them in the service, doesn't want them in the service. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=198.92s)]
*  And he's doing what he can to drive them out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  You mentioned, of course, before the controversy that the senator has engaged in about appearing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  to defy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=211.12s)]
*  It's unclear. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=212.12s)]
*  Does he not know what white nationalism is? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=213.12s)]
*  He seems to be skeptical of any efforts by the Department of Defense to find and block [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=215.44s)]
*  from joining the service outright white nationalists. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=222.36s)]
*  And he doesn't like that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=226.8s)]
*  He thinks that it's unclear what he understands about this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=228.0s)]
*  This is him talking to our own Ryan Nobles, giving his sort of latest version of this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=230.64s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=236.52s)]
*  I wonder if you could kind of clarify for us what you meant on CNN about white nationalism [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=237.52s)]
*  and generally your thoughts on it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=244.44s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I'm totally against any racism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'm told that white nationalism, they consider racism. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=248.42s)]
*  I'm totally against that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=253.73999999999998s)]
*  What is he doing here? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=255.98s)]
*  Is he is he playing like he doesn't understand or does he not understand? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=256.97999999999996s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=259.82s)]
*  I think he is bending to pressure from his colleagues that finally said enough is enough, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=261.14s)]
*  Senator. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  This is wrong. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  This is wrong to be in the military. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  White nationalism is pure racism. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=272.12s)]
*  It's racism in its rawest form. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=274.5s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=277.9s)]
*  It was just stunning to me that he said, I'm told that it was white racism. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=278.9s)]
*  He told CNN the other night, well, it was just her opinion it was white race, that it [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=285.06s)]
*  was racism. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=289.3s)]
*  It is very difficult with him when he says these things, which, by the way, was not his [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=290.3s)]
*  first rodeo on talking about white nationalism and including some other racist comments. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  This is not the first time that has happened. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=302.36s)]
*  I think he's bending to some pressure. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=305.06s)]
*  It's clear that he really didn't believe it or want to say it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=307.94s)]
*  At least that's the impression you get with watching and listening to him, that he was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=311.74s)]
*  begrudgingly trying to clarify for his colleagues sake, not his. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good and important point. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=323.3s)]
*  Every bite at the apple, he keeps doing the same thing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=326.98s)]
*  Well, you say it's this and if they say that, then I guess. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=328.98s)]
*  It's like you could, I mean, you're a U.S. senator. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=332.18s)]
*  You can go read a few books, spend a few hours trying to figure out what the term means, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=334.62s)]
*  Google it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=338.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=339.9s)]
*  But this thing of like, well, they keep telling me. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=340.9s)]
*  Yeah, more importantly, he's from Alabama. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=343.22s)]
*  He should know things like this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=347.86s)]
*  Remember, this is a guy who, as a candidate, did not know what the Voting Rights Act was. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=350.22s)]
*  I keep coming back to that because that was the first telltale sign about where he actually [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=355.86s)]
*  stands on things. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  You don't even know what it is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=362.88s)]
*  And he didn't. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=365.08s)]
*  It was clear that he didn't know that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=366.08s)]
*  So a senator from Alabama ought to know our history, ought to know where we are, ought [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=367.84s)]
*  to be on the right side of history and not the wrong side. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=372.67999999999995s)]
*  And he has clearly consistently been on the wrong side of history on this issue as well [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  as the military issue. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  Doug Jones, who served as senator from Alabama, thank you very much. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxQIDd0Haa4&t=384.47999999999996s)]
