# ‘Palpable enthusiasm’ Harris picks up steam in battleground states
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck)
*  As Donald Trump and Republicans departed their convention in Milwaukee last month, they were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=0.0s)]
*  confident that they had the election in the bag. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=3.84s)]
*  And they were right that the polling really did show them ahead. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=6.72s)]
*  The electoral mouth was moving in their favor with Trump leading President Joe Biden in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=9.6s)]
*  many of the key battleground states and having a variety of ways to get to that 270 to win. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=13.68s)]
*  Well, now we're in a different world. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=18.92s)]
*  New polling of likely voters in three crucial blue wall states, so-called, Michigan, Wisconsin, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=20.8s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=25.84s)]
*  Of course, Donald Trump won those in 2016. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=26.84s)]
*  They show Harris leading by four points. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=28.72s)]
*  That is within the margin of error, but also a significant swing from last month when President [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=31.52s)]
*  Biden was virtually tied or slightly behind in all three states in the same New York Times [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=35.76s)]
*  Sienna College poll. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=40.2s)]
*  Vice President Harris is also wiping out Donald Trump's lead across the sunbelt. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=42.08s)]
*  That's in the morning console Bloomberg polling. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=45.92s)]
*  Registered voters in Arizona back her over Trump, 49 to 47, 47 to 45 percent in Nevada. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  In Georgia, Harris and Trump are neck and neck and the race is also within the margin [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=54.32s)]
*  of error in North Carolina, which Joe Biden didn't carry in 2020, though he did carry [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=58.04s)]
*  Georgia, Arizona, Nevada. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=62.8s)]
*  All which provides a whole bunch of different routes for the Harris campaign to get to the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=65.24s)]
*  270 electoral votes needed for victory. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=69.84s)]
*  Dan Cannon is the battleground director for the Harris Walls campaign. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=72.52s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=76.48s)]
*  Dan, it's great to have you on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=77.48s)]
*  First of all, just how does the campaign see what the set of battleground states are? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=79.4s)]
*  Well, you named a bunch of them, Chris, and I want to point out that we feel great about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=84.72s)]
*  the momentum. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=89.12s)]
*  We've had tons of volunteer activity. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=90.12s)]
*  We've had hundreds of thousands of folks sign up for this campaign and thousands of them [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=91.96s)]
*  shifted into activity and activation for voters. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=95.64s)]
*  But all those polls you mentioned, it's a great it's great movement in some respects, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=98.88s)]
*  but it's still a very close race. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=102.68s)]
*  And something our campaign has emphasized from the beginning is that those seven states, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=104.22s)]
*  the Blue Wall states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=108.68s)]
*  Nevada, they've just been really, really close states every single cycle. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=113.68s)]
*  They were close in 18. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=117.64000000000001s)]
*  They were close in 2020. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=118.64000000000001s)]
*  They're close in 2022, whether it's a governor's race, a Senate race or for president. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  They're just very, very tight places. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=124.84s)]
*  And we have believed this entire time that having an operation that could be at scale [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=127.04s)]
*  and engage people on the ground and have a presence and voter activation was necessary [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=132.24s)]
*  to win a close election. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=136.44s)]
*  This campaign has been designed to win a close election. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=138.0s)]
*  And now with that volunteer enthusiasm we're seeing in those crowds, we're turning that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=140.84s)]
*  into action in all those places where we expect close races. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=144.28s)]
*  But as you said, many pathways within those seven states. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=147.36s)]
*  Yeah, let's let me stay on that for a second. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, you have a rally in Arizona, 20,000 people show up or in Wayne County, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  right outside Detroit in the airport, 15,000 people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=159.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=161.96s)]
*  Now, obviously, there's a bunch of reasons you do that, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=162.96s)]
*  You get supporters fired up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  You get a lot of local media. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=166.64s)]
*  And usually it's pretty positive when the story is 15,000 people came out for a candidate, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=168.28s)]
*  right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=173.24s)]
*  Are there other ways in which people that are going to rallies like that are getting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=174.24s)]
*  plugged into the campaign that give you a more durable organizational advantage over [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=177.44s)]
*  this last three months here? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=182.16s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=184.2s)]
*  Everyone that goes to that rally, the staff is there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=186.72s)]
*  Again, 1,500 staff across battlegrounds, 260 offices. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=189.44s)]
*  So when that crowd comes to a state, there's a team there, both staff and volunteers, that's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=193.92s)]
*  meeting those folks as they're in line, waiting to get in the venue. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=198.28s)]
*  They're being clipboarded. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=200.92s)]
*  They're being asked to join a volunteer shift. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=201.92s)]
*  We're then getting them into volunteer and then reshifting them for more volunteer shifts [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  to make them recurring volunteers and to bring their friends and to grow that organization. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=207.88s)]
*  In Nevada alone, Chris, 5,000 volunteer shifts came out of that rally in Las Vegas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=212.28s)]
*  More than 4,000 were from Native Nevadans, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=218.44s)]
*  And then those folks will, again, grow the organization from there. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  More than 30,000 folks have signed up the Arizona campaign since the president endorsed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=224.55999999999997s)]
*  the vice president. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=229.27999999999997s)]
*  There are hundreds of thousands of folks getting involved and tens of thousands at these rallies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=230.27999999999997s)]
*  But the key is, if it's an organization that's there, built to engage those folks, that it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=234.27999999999997s)]
*  doesn't just evaporate in a thin air. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=239.04s)]
*  It gets put into action. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  It gets channeled into talking to voters, into registering them, into hearing ballots, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  into having a presence in communities, doing door knocking and phone calling, being a permission [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=247.44s)]
*  structure and a persuasive presence, and then ultimately mobilizing people at the end [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=251.28s)]
*  of the campaign. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=254.76s)]
*  That takes work and an organization that we have built to capitalize on this incredible [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=255.76s)]
*  organic and palpable enthusiasm for Kamala Harris. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=259.72s)]
*  So when we go back to that map, we talk about those states. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=264.08s)]
*  And again, I think they're familiar to people because these so-called blue wall states, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=266.84s)]
*  which are the states that Donald Trump had flipped in 2016 that gave him the path. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=270.24s)]
*  three sun belt states, Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=275.72s)]
*  North Carolina is in there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  It's very interesting because North Carolina is a really interesting state. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=284.72s)]
*  It's almost, I mean, it's very closely divided. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=287.36s)]
*  It has a very gerrymandered legislature, but it has a popular two-term democratic governor. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=289.36s)]
*  Barack Obama carried it, I believe, in 8 and 12. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  It always seems really close. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  This year I've heard from the formerly the Biden campaign before the switch of nominees [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=300.34s)]
*  to now that there was a genuine feeling North Carolina was as much a possibility as any [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=305.06s)]
*  state. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=312.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=313.02s)]
*  Well, a couple of reasons, Chris. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=314.02s)]
*  And I ran that state in 2016 for Hillary Clinton at the end of that campaign. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=315.62s)]
*  So I know precisely how tough it is to win. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=318.58s)]
*  It's been close. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=320.82s)]
*  Rays are close in many elections, but we haven't quite gotten over the hump since that 2008 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=321.82s)]
*  Barack Obama win where he won a bunch of states, right? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=325.7s)]
*  In 2016, it was about a three and a half point margin for Trump and Clinton. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=328.44s)]
*  We cut that by more than half in 2020. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=333.24s)]
*  The president lost that by about a point, 1.3 points in 2020. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=335.74s)]
*  And now with demographic shifts, the state's a little better for us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=340.7s)]
*  But I think really importantly, there are just such an element of extreme mega politics [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=343.72s)]
*  in North Carolina. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=349.08s)]
*  You've got Mark Robinson, who says things all the time that I don't want to say on the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=350.08s)]
*  air and really repels voters. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=354.6s)]
*  He is a direct line from Donald Trump. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=357.34s)]
*  Those politics are of Trump. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=360.34s)]
*  They are the same thing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=362.14s)]
*  It's a mega ticket there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=363.14s)]
*  I think voters rejected that kind of politics in North Carolina. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=364.14s)]
*  Josh Stein's doing really well. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=366.85999999999996s)]
*  He's a fantastic candidate for governor. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  Roy Cooper's been a great governor. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  I think we have an organization there, a message, and voters in that state do not want to go [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=371.34s)]
*  down that really extreme path. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=375.58s)]
*  I think that state in particular is one that we can really turn this time around. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  And it's one of those seven, I think, Chris, any one of which could be the decisive state [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  in a very close election. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=385.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnyVsgL4gck&t=387.82s)]
