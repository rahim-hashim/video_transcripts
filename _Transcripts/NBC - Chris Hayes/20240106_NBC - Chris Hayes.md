# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Jan. 5
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o)
*  Joining me now is Lawrence Tribe, University Professor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=0.0s)]
*  of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=2.68s)]
*  Professor Tribe, you've been very outspoken and active [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=6.08s)]
*  on this issue. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=8.28s)]
*  And I want to start with you on this interesting legal [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=9.0s)]
*  question, which is the adoption of what's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=11.24s)]
*  called the questions presented in the grant. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=13.68s)]
*  So basically, the court says, here's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  the framing for what is being debated before us, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=19.16s)]
*  what we're ruling on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And the question presented, they adopted, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=24.04s)]
*  is the one from Trump's cert petition. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=25.96s)]
*  And it's a simple one. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=28.72s)]
*  Did the Colorado Supreme Court err [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  in ordering President Trump excluded [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=32.2s)]
*  from the 2024 presidential primary ballot? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=34.28s)]
*  And the reason that's interesting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=36.44s)]
*  is because the Colorado GOP, which also appealed, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=37.72s)]
*  had much more sort of specific and technical questions [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=40.92s)]
*  presented. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=44.04s)]
*  But it looks like the court is adopting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=44.8s)]
*  the kind of broadest possible, which [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=46.44s)]
*  gives them any possible avenue to consider. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=48.36s)]
*  I think you're exactly right, Chris. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=53.6s)]
*  They adopted a question that doesn't constrain them [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=55.8s)]
*  in any way. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=59.12s)]
*  They are going to decide whether to affirm or reverse [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=60.32s)]
*  the Colorado Supreme Court. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=64.84s)]
*  There are many exit ramps. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=66.64s)]
*  There are many approaches. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=68.56s)]
*  What is interesting is that if you are a strict textualist, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  you really read the words of the 14th Amendment Section 3. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  Or if you are a so-called originalist, a historian, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=80.08s)]
*  someone like Jack Rakoff of Stanford, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=84.24s)]
*  a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  leaves no doubt that the right answer would be the one [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=90.56s)]
*  that conservatives would give. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=94.92s)]
*  It is more prudential moderates and liberals [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  like Kagan and Jackson and Sotomayor, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  who might wring their hands over the broad systemic impact [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=104.36s)]
*  on democracy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=108.84s)]
*  That's an ironic situation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  It's filled with ironies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you read the briefing submitted by Donald Trump [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=114.0s)]
*  and also by the Republicans of Colorado, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=117.64s)]
*  it's filled with peons of praise to democracy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=124.8s)]
*  The people should not be deprived of their vote. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=128.88s)]
*  But Mr. Raffensperger, can't you just find me 11,180 of them? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=131.84s)]
*  This is all about depriving the people of the right [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=137.6s)]
*  to end a presidency by engaging in what a detailed trial [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  in Colorado concluded was insurrection. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't think the court is likely [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=153.72s)]
*  to take a technical off-ramp. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=155.72s)]
*  I don't think it's likely to hold that the words [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=158.64s)]
*  of the oath that the president took to preserve, protect, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=162.16s)]
*  and defend the Constitution didn't use the word support [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=165.56s)]
*  the Constitution and therefore the president is not covered. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=169.92s)]
*  I don't think they're going to take a kind of technical, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=175.76s)]
*  highly legalistic approach. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  I think that the conservatives are going to have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  to establish that they mean what they say. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  And the one way they could do that is to say [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=191.2s)]
*  that although the original meaning of section three [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  of the 14th amendment was that you didn't have to be tried [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=197.88s)]
*  or convicted of insurrection, as long as there was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=201.84s)]
*  a determination that you were an insurrectionist. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=206.92s)]
*  Congress didn't need to create a special scheme to do that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=210.92s)]
*  because people knew what the score was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=215.68s)]
*  at the time of the Confederacy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  But now you have to become a little bit [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=222.76s)]
*  of a living constitutionalist. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=224.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=227.04s)]
*  Decades have passed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=227.88s)]
*  Now things are different. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=229.64s)]
*  Now there's a lot more controversy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=230.96s)]
*  about the meaning of these terms. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=233.36s)]
*  Now we need to wait for Congress to figure it all out [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=235.28s)]
*  and put a procedure in place that is more uniform nationwide. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=239.28s)]
*  That would be a plausible decision, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=244.12s)]
*  not one consistent with genuine textualism or originalism, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=246.6s)]
*  but one that might make sense to the broad middle [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=251.84s)]
*  of the court. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=254.52s)]
*  At the same time, they've got this very easy case [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=255.48s)]
*  about absolute presidential immunity [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=258.56s)]
*  or whether the fact that he was on trial [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=261.68s)]
*  for an impeachable offense and then acquitted by the Senate, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=265.48s)]
*  whether that somehow precludes his running. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=270.0s)]
*  Those are easy questions. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  The court is certainly not gonna go with Trump on those. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=274.76s)]
*  So if you're a pragmatist, you are likely to say [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=278.56s)]
*  that they could cut this Gordian knot in half. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=282.72s)]
*  They could basically say that, of course, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=286.92s)]
*  presidents are not immune from crimes they commit [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  while they're in office, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  just because they're wielding their presidential power, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=294.6s)]
*  especially when they're wielding it to overturn democracy [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  and stay in power beyond the four-year vested term. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=302.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, on the other hand, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  even though they have to face the music in criminal court, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  we are not gonna let one state after another [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=312.56s)]
*  make up special procedures to figure out [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=315.8s)]
*  whether they are insurrectionists. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=319.36s)]
*  I don't think the court would damage itself very much, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=322.2s)]
*  except with purists and people like me and Judge Looting, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=325.48s)]
*  who take the text a little more seriously. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=329.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I think, a very interesting and plausible way [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=333.2s)]
*  of seeing both the legal reasoning here, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=336.92s)]
*  the practical reasoning, the sort of modes of political, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=339.04s)]
*  the modes of constitutional interpretation [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=342.04s)]
*  and the weird cross pressures within them, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=343.8s)]
*  to go back to Judge Posner's view on judging. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=347.0s)]
*  Lorne's tribe, it's always such a great pleasure [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=350.0s)]
*  to hear you talk about this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=351.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=352.48s)]
*  Today, President Joe Biden traveled [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=355.44s)]
*  to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=356.98s)]
*  the site of George Washington's headquarters [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=358.56s)]
*  during the Revolutionary War [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=360.8s)]
*  to deliver his first campaign speech of the election year. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=361.92s)]
*  The president laid out the stakes of the upcoming battle, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=365.88s)]
*  be framed as a fight for our democracy, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=367.88s)]
*  and then he invoked the violent attack on our country, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=370.34s)]
*  led by the ex-president three years ago tomorrow. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump's mob was a peaceful protest. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=378.46s)]
*  It was a violent assault. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=381.53999999999996s)]
*  They were insurrectionists, not patriots. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  They weren't there to uphold the Constitution. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=387.29999999999995s)]
*  They were there to destroy the Constitution. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=389.94s)]
*  Trump won't do what an American president must do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  He refuses to denounce political violence. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=397.82s)]
*  So hear me clearly. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=402.38s)]
*  I'll say what Donald Trump won't. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=404.34s)]
*  Political violence is never, ever acceptable [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=406.18s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=408.94s)]
*  Political is never, never, never. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=409.78s)]
*  It has no place in a democracy, none. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=412.18s)]
*  Michael Fanone is a former Washington, DC, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=417.34s)]
*  metropolitan police officer who was brutally attacked [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=419.26s)]

*  You know, I was thinking about you today. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=441.0s)]
*  I was told that we had you, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=442.9s)]
*  and I was just thinking about the strangeness [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  and surrealness I feel in watching this event, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=447.02s)]
*  which again, I just watched on television, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  but covered and saw, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=451.29999999999995s)]
*  that everyone afterwards sort of understood, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=453.26s)]
*  I think basically across all lines of difference [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=456.58s)]
*  in America was horrible. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=458.58s)]
*  Slowly, that consensus being chipped away, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=460.94s)]
*  and the reality of what that happened [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  being refashioned and reshaped, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=465.26s)]
*  and 25% of Americans think the FBI instigated it, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=467.06s)]
*  and a whole bunch of people think [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=471.94s)]
*  it was much to do about nothing, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=475.58s)]
*  and a majority of Republicans think we should move on [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=477.09999999999997s)]
*  and not talk about it anymore. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=479.46s)]
*  And as someone who is there [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=481.5s)]
*  in the most sort of brutal part of it, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=483.1s)]
*  just what your experience is [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=486.22s)]
*  to watch that same process happen? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=488.14s)]
*  I mean, it was frustrating. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=494.54s)]
*  At times, it is, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=499.3s)]
*  it enrages me [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=504.74s)]
*  to see so many Americans buy into the BS [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=506.62s)]
*  and these conspiracy theories surrounding January 6th. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=512.9s)]
*  But I mean, it also, it pisses me off [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=519.42s)]
*  to see Republican lawmakers continue to spread the lies [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=522.46s)]
*  and conspiracy theories regarding January 6th [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=528.7s)]
*  in an attempt to whitewash that day [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=534.1800000000001s)]
*  because it's politically inconvenient for them [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=537.98s)]
*  to acknowledge the reality of what happened. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=541.38s)]
*  You're someone, I think, who, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=545.6600000000001s)]
*  I gotta imagine, I don't know what your personal politics are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=548.38s)]
*  or what they were in the past, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=551.1800000000001s)]
*  but I gotta imagine that you just have experienced [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=553.1s)]
*  firsthand people who don't think it was a big deal [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=556.46s)]
*  or do think that it was an FBI con job [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=560.74s)]
*  or do think it was anti-file. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=564.5s)]
*  Like have you had that conversation [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=565.78s)]
*  with the person that you know? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=567.8199999999999s)]
*  Here we are for three years, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=569.66s)]
*  just to be like, dude, I was there, I am telling you. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=570.66s)]
*  Like, is that a conversation you have had to have or have? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=573.78s)]
*  I've had that conversation countless times. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=578.2199999999999s)]
*  I've had the conversation as to the significance of the day [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=582.54s)]
*  and to whether or not it was as bad as, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=587.86s)]
*  as I have described it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=594.18s)]
*  I've had the conversation trying to dispel [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=596.2199999999999s)]
*  people who I know's theories or conspiracy theories [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=601.74s)]
*  regarding who was responsible for the attack on the Capitol. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=608.98s)]
*  I mean, the conversations that I've had [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  have pretty much run the gambit when it comes to [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=616.6999999999999s)]
*  you know, the theories that are, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=621.1s)]
*  have been spread about that day. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=626.22s)]
*  And I, you know, I really chalk it up to the fact [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=627.82s)]
*  that you have the Republican Party [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=630.34s)]
*  who continues to spread lies, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=633.46s)]
*  to support the lies that inspired thousands of Americans [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=635.6600000000001s)]
*  to attack the United States Capitol [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=641.34s)]
*  and to assault law enforcement officers [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=644.26s)]
*  and threaten the lives of members of Congress [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=647.62s)]
*  and their staff. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=650.0600000000001s)]
*  And I also attribute it to the, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=651.5400000000001s)]
*  to Democrats, I guess, inability to express anger [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=656.0200000000001s)]
*  and outrage and to educate Americans [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=664.86s)]
*  who may not live within, you know, inside the Beltway [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=673.22s)]
*  as to the significance of January 6th [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=677.34s)]
*  and to the threat the former president [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=681.3000000000001s)]
*  and his administration and to the Republican Party [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=684.5s)]
*  at this point, pose to America and our democracy. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=687.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, I think about, you know, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=692.1s)]
*  the former president is fundamentally, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=694.22s)]
*  he's a rich guy's son. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=696.14s)]
*  He got dropped off at prep school in a limousine, literally. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=697.98s)]
*  And people have had to clean up for him his entire life. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=701.3000000000001s)]
*  And you've seen people have to deal with the stuff [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=703.74s)]
*  that he does time and time again. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=706.94s)]
*  You know, he's running for president now today. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=709.34s)]
*  In fact, he was telling a crowd of people it was the FBI. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=711.62s)]
*  I just think about like, what it must be like for you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=714.6600000000001s)]
*  to watch him still out there, still saying these things. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=717.3800000000001s)]
*  You know, talking about, you know, in March, he said, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=721.3800000000001s)]
*  "'Let the January 6 prisoners go. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=724.94s)]

*  Like, to see the degree of impunity he has experienced [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=730.58s)]
*  versus what your experience [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=734.46s)]
*  in the last three years have been like. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=735.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it makes my blood boil. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=738.94s)]
*  I mean, we've had conversations, you and I, Chris. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=742.82s)]
*  I think you can imagine, you know, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=745.1800000000001s)]
*  the emotion that it elicits from myself [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=748.1400000000001s)]
*  having experienced the things that I did on that day. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOCGuXFaA4o&t=752.1s)]
