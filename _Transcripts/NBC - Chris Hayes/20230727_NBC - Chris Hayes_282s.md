# ‘Page 29 is everything’: Legal expert explains new charges in Mar-a-Lago case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE)
*  But joining me now is Laura Jarrett, senior legal correspondent for NBC News, one of the best legal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=0.0s)]
*  eagles out there. So Laura, I mean, we've both read this. You are a lawyer. I am not. Tell me, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  what in this superseding indictment poses the biggest threat to Trump? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  This helps flesh out the prosecutor's story, their theory of the case. We had already seen [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  in detail the allegations about him keeping the classified documents of Mar-a-Lago and then trying [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=21.44s)]
*  to scroll them away and hide them once authorities try to get them back. This helps provide insight [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=27.2s)]
*  into what prosecutors would talk about as a consciousness of guilt. The idea, the allegation, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=32.32s)]
*  their theory here that he actually attempted to engage in a conspiracy, an agreement with others [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=37.68s)]
*  to delete the security footage. There is no reason for you to delete the security footage [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  if you didn't think you did anything wrong. And so the prosecutors would want to be able to use [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=50.32s)]
*  that to tell a story to the jury that would make sense. Now, what stuck out to me a lot in here, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=54.88s)]
*  but is page 29 in this indictment. Yes, page 29 is everything. Page 29 is everything. This has the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  details of this conversation in the audio closet. It doesn't have Trump, though, his audio recording. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  It has this implication that Trump wanted this to happen. So how in a court of law do you prove it? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=74.64s)]
*  Do they need one of these? It seems clear that employee number four here may be working with [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=80.4s)]
*  Jack Smith's team. Is that your belief as well? I think that that is certainly an implication that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=86.72s)]
*  is fair to read from this. He turned over text messages, appeared. It's not clear whether there [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=91.12s)]
*  was other some sort of wire or other recording in that little audio room. And it's so detailed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  It's not an exact transcription, but it would be a lot for employee four, the IT director, to remember [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  all of this by memory. And obviously, if prosecutors are going to alleges, they want to be able to back [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=107.76s)]
*  it up. And so they're going to need to be able to put someone on the witness stand to be able to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=112.0s)]
*  authenticate that. And they're not going to be able to put on the IT director who through hearsay is [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  saying, I was told that the boss wanted it done. They need some direct evidence. So we don't know [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=120.64000000000001s)]
*  here. Well, not a, I mean, he obviously hasn't flipped daily Vera, the new defendant. We don't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=125.2s)]
*  know anything about him flipping clearly. Do they need one of them in order to make this a strong [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=130.56s)]
*  enough case or could they do it without that? Well, it certainly would be helpful to them, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=136.16s)]
*  but I'm not sure that it's essential at this point. I know we know from reporting the prosecutors did [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=140.16s)]
*  try hard to get Nata to flip previously before charging him. And he so far has not shown any [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=145.44s)]
*  indication to doing that. However, we're still in the early stages of this, right? As far as we [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=150.88s)]
*  understand it, this grand jury is actually still active. We don't know other witnesses, other [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=156.24s)]
*  testimony. What else is going on down there in Florida? Obviously we were all focused on [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=161.52s)]
*  Washington, DC. We didn't even know about the superseding indictment here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  This is not a single card this morning. No, no, we were focused elsewhere. Um, but so I think we, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=169.44s)]
*  we don't yet know. I think what else they have, what are their cards prosecutors have to play here? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=174.4s)]
*  And maybe they don't need Nata or delivery era to flip. It would certainly be helpful if they did, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=178.56s)]
*  but it might not be essential to proving their case against the former president. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  So one of the charges is about this Iran war plan, this Iran document that Trump is on, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=187.12s)]
*  on audio talking about. How significant is it that there's audio of him talking about it? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=192.24s)]
*  Does that matter a lot? It was always significant to have the audio and certainly now they have the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=197.84s)]
*  document and that's, that was always sort of a question mark out there because the former [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=202.16s)]
*  president through implication had almost made it seem like, well, maybe it was just bluster. Maybe [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=206.08s)]
*  it was a newspaper. Who knows? No, it turns out the document is real and they got it and they got [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  it back and they say when they got it back because he returned the documents to NARA, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=215.12s)]
*  national archives in January, 2022 and detailed here in a handy dandy chart that our Lisa Rubin, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=220.24s)]
*  our other legal Eagle found, it explains how long he retained the classified documents illegally, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  according to prosecutors. And it shows that they've actually got the document back. And so I think, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=234.0s)]
*  again, it helps bolster their case to be able to show the jury. Um, here's the document, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=239.36s)]
*  here's the recording, here's, you know, it all speaks to his state of mind. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=244.48s)]
*  Laura Jarrett, one of the hardest working women in journalism and legal eagling. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=248.56s)]
*  I think I can say the same in the next fit. 49 minutes. If any news breaks, just come back. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=252.88s)]
*  We'll be here till nine o'clock. Thank you so much. Laura Jarrett. Appreciate you joining me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=257.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-yC4VIyrdE&t=274.48s)]
