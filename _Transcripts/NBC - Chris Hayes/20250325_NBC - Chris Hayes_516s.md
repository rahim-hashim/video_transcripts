# ‘It is wrong’: Warren sounds off on the Trump-Musk attack on Social Security
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY)
*  Elon Musk wants to eliminate Social Security. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans know that even cutting it outright would be massively unpopular [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=3.0s)]
*  because Social Security is one of the most successful programs in the country, if not the most successful. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=7.0s)]
*  To get around that, it appears the Trump administration is gutting the program's resources, trying to decapitate it, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=12.0s)]
*  as Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out in the confirmation hearing for the new Social Security Commissioner today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=18.0s)]
*  Doge is considering slashing up to 50% of the Social Security administration's workforce. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=25.0s)]
*  That means longer lines, more errors. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=32.0s)]
*  And for everyone who gives up or who dies before they get their benefits sorted out, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=35.0s)]
*  those delays and errors also turn into benefit cuts. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=40.0s)]
*  The law is to deliver the benefits that people are legally entitled to. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=45.0s)]
*  If you don't have the staff, if you don't answer the phones, if you don't fix the mistakes, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=51.0s)]
*  people don't get what they're legally entitled to. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=57.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=61.0s)]
*  a member of the Finance Committee that held today's confirmation hearing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=64.0s)]
*  Senator, let me start with this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=68.0s)]
*  We've heard lots of reporting. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=70.0s)]
*  The Washington Post had a rundown of the kind of chaos in the system, the web outages, the phones ringing off the hook, the offices understaffed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=72.0s)]
*  Are you hearing this just first person as a Senator from constituents? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=79.0s)]
*  Are you getting this in your offices about what is happening to this program? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=83.0s)]
*  Yes, we are hearing it everywhere. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=88.0s)]
*  And understand the personal toll that we're talking about for these folks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=91.0s)]
*  More than half of the people who receive Social Security count on it to put groceries on the table and keep a roof over their heads. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=96.0s)]
*  We're talking about people in their 70s and their 80s and their 90s, people who often have mobility challenges, people who struggle. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=104.0s)]
*  And what's happening right now at the Social Security office is they're saying, in effect, nobody really to answer the phones. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=114.0s)]
*  So that means you've got to find somebody to get you down to a Social Security office. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=121.0s)]
*  Oh, whoops, they closed that Social Security office. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=126.0s)]
*  So you've got to travel what, two hours, three hours to be able to get to another Social Security office. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=130.0s)]
*  When you get there, we're hearing about lines that are 50 people long with two people in the Social Security office to try to help answer questions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=136.0s)]
*  Office closes before people even have an opportunity to get up and ask their questions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=146.0s)]
*  And that is repeated over and over. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=153.0s)]
*  And understand this, Social Security is not charity. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=156.0s)]
*  It is not some giveaway. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=161.0s)]
*  It is something that people earned throughout all of their working years on a promise from America that said you pay into that system. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=163.0s)]
*  And then when you retire, you can count on those benefits solid. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=173.0s)]
*  They will be there for you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=179.0s)]
*  And instead, what Elon Musk and Donald Trump, our co-presidents, are doing right now is effectively cutting the benefits that people were promised and they are making people suffer all across this country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=181.0s)]
*  It is wrong. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, maybe some of them should find a billionaire as a son-in-law and they can be fine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=199.0s)]
*  They won't have to worry about the check. That would help them out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=202.0s)]
*  Did you get any sense from Mr. Bisognano today that he would exert any independent control over this, that he would be responsive, or do you see him as essentially a kind of doge-stooge apparatchik? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=205.0s)]
*  You know, look, I raised the question directly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=218.0s)]
*  I pointed out the places where if you make enough cuts in service, you have effectively cut the benefits. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=222.0s)]
*  And we all know you can't cut those Social Security benefits without coming right here to Congress. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=230.0s)]
*  Only Congress can cut the benefits. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=236.0s)]
*  But you can backdoor cut them. And he admitted that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is the law. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=242.0s)]
*  And so cutting, for example, the number of people who work at the Social Security Administration can turn out to be effectively a cut in benefits. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=243.0s)]
*  So I said, will you at least commit to rehiring the people who've been cut? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=253.0s)]
*  Get Social Security back up to the level at least where it was. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=257.0s)]
*  Frankly, still wasn't enough, but at least where it was. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=261.0s)]
*  And all we heard is blah, blah, blah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=265.0s)]
*  I'll think about it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=268.0s)]
*  But he did not make that commitment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=269.0s)]
*  And why? Because he is in league with Donald Trump and with Elon Musk to cut Social Security for millions of people across this country who depend on it, the millions of people who don't have a billionaire son-in-law. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=271.0s)]
*  You know, one of the most unnerving stories we see in the first two months is the use of this agency as a sort of weaponized political tool against citizens. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=285.0s)]
*  I want to just ask you about this, because there was this story in Maine. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=295.0s)]
*  There was this story in Maine where basically the governor of Maine challenged the president on one of his executive orders. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=299.0s)]
*  They had a kind of, you know, testy exchange in the White House. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=305.0s)]
*  And then subsequently, Maine found out that the program that automatically enrolls your newborn in the hospital with a Social Security number had been terminated with no notice. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=308.0s)]
*  And you now had to go with your newborn to an office to get that Social Security number. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=316.0s)]
*  And it looked like it was a reprisal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=321.0s)]
*  And now we have confirmation. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=323.0s)]
*  The man who's running Social Security, Leland Dudek, who's sort of the doge officer there, said he had ordered the move to cancel this after watching Janet Mills, Maine's Democratic governor, clash with Mr. Trump at the White House. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=324.0s)]
*  I was ticked at the governor of Maine for not being real cordial to the president, Mr. Dudek said. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=337.0s)]
*  And then he said that he owned it and he was, you know, he was sorry and he won't do it again. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=343.0s)]
*  But I am astonished this happened. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=349.0s)]
*  And do you have any confidence it won't happen again? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=352.0s)]
*  No, I do not have confidence it won't happen again because it is the mindset of the Trump administration. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=355.0s)]
*  And that is that this government is to be run for a handful of billionaires and people with power and everyone else can just eat dirt. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=362.0s)]
*  That is the view of the Trump administration. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=374.0s)]
*  We're feeling it right now in the Social Security administration, but we're feeling it everywhere that Elon Musk goes with his magic chainsaw to fire people to do it in ugly ways, to undermine the kind of obligations that we have passed here in Congress to get rid of the consumer agency, to try to shut down the Department of Education. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=377.0s)]
*  And why? It is all in service to government that works better for the rich and the powerful. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=401.0s)]
*  This is all leading toward the Republicans, Elon Musk and Donald Trump and Republicans here in Congress, who want to push through a big tax giveaway that's going to cost $4.7 billion, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=409.0s)]
*  go mostly to billionaires and billionaire corporations, and they want to pay for it on the backs of seniors, on the backs of little kids, on the backs of people with disabilities, on the backs of veterans, on the backs of just hardworking people all across this country. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=424.0s)]
*  That is the ultimate battle. And this story at Social Security right now is just the most visible picture of what's going on. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=444.0s)]
*  Final quick question for you, someone who served on the Armed Services Committee, given what we know about this group chat leak and the Secretary of Defense texting war plans out on unsecured channels to a journalist. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=453.0s)]
*  Do you think Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense should resign? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=467.0s)]
*  If Pete Hegseth had even a sliver of self-respect and sense of honor, he would have already put his resignation on the president's desk. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=470.0s)]
*  And if he's not willing to do that, then the president of the United States has a moral and, in my view, legal obligation to fire him. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=483.0s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you so much. Really appreciate it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=492.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS4esRBS4tY&t=500.0s)]
