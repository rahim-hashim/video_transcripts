# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: July 25
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4)
*  We are also getting new information about another potential communication between the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=0.0s)]
*  special counsel and a key figure in the election investigation, an attorney for John Eastman, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  the lawyer who pushed that nonsensical theory, you may remember, that Mike Pence could overturn [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=10.68s)]
*  the election on January 6th. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=15.74s)]
*  He tells NBC News that he is working on a proactive Hail Mary for his client, which [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=18.26s)]
*  is basically a memo to prosecutors explaining why Eastman committed no crimes, a lot to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=23.36s)]
*  dig into on the legal front. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=28.82s)]
*  Joining me now is Jonathan Deans, NBC News Chief Justice Contributor. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=30.7s)]
*  So you've been behind a lot of this reporting and I understand you have new reporting about [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=34.8s)]
*  the thinking of John Eastman and other defense lawyers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=39.14s)]
*  So what can you tell us about their expectations for a looming indictment? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=42.54s)]
*  Well first let's start with Mr. Eastman. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=45.78s)]
*  We spoke with one of his lawyers this afternoon and he says they're working on drafting a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=47.7s)]
*  letter to prosecutors both in Washington and in Georgia, both the federal and Georgia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=52.1s)]
*  And that they hope to have this memo drafted by next week to say to prosecutors, look, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=58.78s)]
*  he did nothing wrong, he was just a lawyer, floating theories, floating ideas on how President [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=63.24s)]
*  Trump could win the argument and stay in office. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=69.18s)]
*  There was nothing criminal here, we're not going to cop to any plea, and we hope to get [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=71.86s)]
*  this letter in front of prosecutors before they make any charging decision regarding [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Eastman. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=81.1s)]
*  Now I know it was described as a Hail Mary. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=82.1s)]
*  Based on your reporting, why did they think it was necessary at this point in time and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=84.78s)]
*  moment? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  Well there are some legal experts who would call it a Hail Mary. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  The defense lawyers believe that he did nothing wrong so they feel they want to head this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=91.66s)]
*  off. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=95.74s)]
*  They obviously, they've not received any target letter, they've received no official communication [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=96.74s)]
*  that he is going to be charged, but clearly based on all the reporting and all the action [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=101.02s)]
*  and activity, they clearly are concerned so they're trying to head off a possible indictment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=105.72s)]
*  On that note, his lawyer and other defense lawyers representing others in this matter [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=112.02s)]
*  are of the view that, at least as far as the special counsel is concerned, special counsel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=117.86s)]
*  sent a target letter to Donald Trump, but so far to no one else. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=123.22s)]
*  So there is thinking, and again it's just thinking, speculation if you will, by these [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=127.36s)]
*  defense lawyers that perhaps, perhaps the special counsel will move forward with an [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=133.0s)]
*  indictment against Trump and Trump only and that if there's a conspiracy charge in there, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=137.42s)]
*  it'll just not name anyone else. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=143.05999999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  Because there is a time frame. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  You know they've got five years to charge anyone with a conspiracy or any of these obstruction [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=148.1s)]
*  charges, but there's a timeline for the election that's coming along with some of the other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=152.45999999999998s)]
*  trials regarding Donald Trump, so perhaps the special counsel needs to move quickly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  on the Donald Trump front if and when he moves forward. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  Let's just pause there for a moment because that's some pretty significant reporting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=166.1s)]
*  I know it's based, it sounds like, on the defense attorneys of other potential targets, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=169.94s)]
*  but what you're telling me now is that it seems like it might only be Trump based on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=176.34s)]
*  their speculation that could be... [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=181.14s)]
*  It's just because this is not coming from inside the special counsel and only the special [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=183.38s)]
*  counsel knows and so far we're getting no comment from them as to if and or when. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=186.78s)]
*  There's speculation that tomorrow's Hunter Biden Day, so maybe tomorrow's not the day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=192.82s)]
*  Will Thursday be the day because that's the next day the grand jury meets, but at least [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=197.38s)]
*  as far as the talk among defense lawyers, so this is just thinking among lawyers who [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=200.98s)]
*  need to represent some of these actors and players, there is some thought that perhaps [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=206.14s)]
*  the special counsel goes with Trump first and then at a later date moves with some others. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=210.94s)]
*  And in terms of a later date, based on your reporting and your sources, is the expectation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=216.62s)]
*  it could be post-election or what's the timeline there? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=221.14s)]
*  I think there is no set timeline. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=224.66s)]
*  Again, if you're basing this just on statute of limitations, there's a five-year running [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=226.9s)]
*  mark from January 6th, so you've got till, what, 2026 to make a determination, so he's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=231.74s)]
*  got time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=238.14s)]
*  There's no time pressure there, but again, we don't know. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=239.14s)]
*  The defense side all say they haven't received other target letters to these actors. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=242.14s)]
*  Only Donald Trump has received one. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=246.54s)]
*  It is not customary for target letters to go out, but you would think in a case like [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=248.26000000000002s)]
*  this if others were going to be charged, perhaps, perhaps the special counsel would be reaching [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  out to some of the other parties to give them that heads up as his customer. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=259.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=263.1s)]
*  So if one indictment watch wasn't enough for all of you, we are also waiting for indictment [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=264.1s)]
*  news from the state of Georgia where there could be potential criminal charges on the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=269.3s)]
*  state level against the ex-president for his efforts to overturn the election as early [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=273.38s)]
*  as next month. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=277.98s)]
*  Now, if you don't remember all of the details of this investigation, I'm going to remind [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=278.98s)]
*  you because in support you know them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=282.66s)]
*  This infamous one-hour phone call Trump had with Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  also serves as a friendly reminder of what this is all about. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  So, look, all I want to do is this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=293.38s)]
*  I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=297.58s)]
*  and flipping the state is a great testament to our country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  And a lot of work has happened under Fonny Willis since that call. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=315.38s)]
*  Fonny Willis opened the investigation back in February of 2021 and the grand jury has [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=321.46s)]
*  been hearing evidence for the past seven months. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=325.62s)]
*  Back in May, Willis instructed her staff to work remotely for a good chunk of the first [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=328.26s)]
*  three weeks of August. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=333.14s)]
*  Remember August is coming up next week. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=334.46s)]
*  She even asked judges in Atlanta to not schedule trials during that time period. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=336.98s)]
*  Last week the Guardian reported that the district attorney has developed evidence to bring racketeering [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=341.5s)]
*  charges in the case, a charge we all usually associate with the mob. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=346.38s)]
*  And today the paper reports that Willis is weighing charges including quote solicitation [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=350.62s)]
*  to commit election fraud and conspiracy to commit election fraud. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=355.24s)]
*  End quote solicitation of a public officer to fail to perform duties and solicitation [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=359.56s)]
*  to destroy, deface or remove ballots, according to two people briefed on the matter. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=365.32s)]
*  I should note NBC News has not confirmed either of those Guardian reports. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=369.36s)]
*  Tanya Miller served as a Fulton County prosecutor and is now a Democratic state representative [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=374.08s)]
*  in Georgia and she joins me now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time this evening. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=380.36s)]
*  I have so many questions for you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=382.8s)]
*  I just wanted to start first of all, the Guardian is reporting that D.A. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=384.4s)]
*  Willis is considering charges that include quote solicitation to commit election fraud, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=388.28s)]
*  conspiracy to commit election fraud, solicitation of a public officer to fail to perform duties [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=392.8s)]
*  and solicitation to destroy, deface or remove ballots. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=397.56s)]
*  Can you explain to us non-lawyers what that means and how they might apply to Trump himself? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=401.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=407.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  So the first thing I think your listeners need to know about kind of how prosecutors [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  approach charging decisions, particularly in Fulton County. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  I was a prosecutor in Fulton County with Madam D.A. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=417.6s)]
*  Fondy Willis for many years. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=420.68s)]
*  And of course, we are taught and trained to charge the highest charge that we believe [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  the evidence will support. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=427.92s)]
*  All of these charges essentially are centered around this idea that the former president [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=430.76s)]
*  sought to interfere with our election by getting folks who were stakeholders in our [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=436.68s)]
*  election process to tip the scale in his favor. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=443.88s)]
*  So when you solicit someone to commit a crime, you try to get them to commit the crime for [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=447.8s)]
*  you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=453.52s)]
*  If you conspire with someone to commit a crime, it means that you have agreed, whether it's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=454.52s)]
*  an explicit agreement or a tacit agreement, that you all are going to commit a crime together. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=459.2s)]
*  In Georgia, you can do any of those things, particularly under the RICO statute, solicit [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=465.56s)]
*  someone to commit crimes or conspire with someone to commit crimes. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=471.0s)]
*  And it can land you, unfortunately, before a petit jury in Fulton County if you do any [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=477.92s)]
*  of that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=483.6s)]
*  So one of the reports that was out last week was that he could also be charged with racketeering, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=484.6s)]
*  which again sounds a little bit like something the mob does. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=490.72s)]
*  But I had this question about whether all of those charges listed in the reporting today [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=493.5s)]
*  could be under racketeering or was your expectation that it would be separate charges? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=497.18s)]
*  Well, of course, you know, most prosecutors will do both, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=502.14s)]
*  So they will charge predicate acts that are all essentially a predicate act is a crime [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=506.86s)]
*  in and of itself. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=512.62s)]
*  So racketeering just means that you commit multiple crimes in furtherance of some scheme [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=513.96s)]
*  or enterprise. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=520.26s)]
*  So a crime in an enterprise can be just a collection of folks who are working together [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=521.26s)]
*  for a purpose, legitimate or illegitimate. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=525.36s)]
*  And if you commit crimes in connection with that purpose, legitimate or illegitimate, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=527.98s)]
*  it can be RICO. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=533.0s)]
*  So all of these crimes can be charged individually by themselves. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=534.52s)]
*  All of them can also be predicates under the RICO Act. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=538.7s)]
*  So prosecutors kind of can get you can get you both ways. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  I want to come to your law school class. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=546.12s)]
*  It seems like from this reporting and from what we know about the Georgia case, there's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  a lot of overlap with what Jack Smith is looking into. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=553.16s)]
*  Is it safe to say or should we assume that Fonny Willis is sharing information with Jack [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=557.0999999999999s)]
*  Smith's team back and forth? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, I think that's really almost on a case by case basis. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=563.76s)]
*  So you'd be surprised to know that that some prosecutors offices work very well together. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=569.18s)]
*  They share information pretty, pretty freely. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=574.38s)]
*  Some prosecutors offices don't. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=577.88s)]
*  So I guess it would really depend on the nature of the relationship between those two offices, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=580.6800000000001s)]
*  the trust that they have with each other, that the other office will protect the integrity [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=586.32s)]
*  of the investigation, each other's respective investigation, that there aren't leaks that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  might compromise the investigation. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=595.24s)]
*  But I would say to you that in the spirit of prosecuting a person who is suspected of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  committing crimes across various states, it is not uncommon to see prosecutors in [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=604.88s)]
*  all of those jurisdictions work together to help each other to accomplish a similar goal. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=610.58s)]
*  And that is to to hold accountable someone that they believe they have sufficient evidence [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=615.9s)]
*  to show is committing crimes across the state. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=620.58s)]
*  So they could be sharing it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=623.34s)]
*  There's no law against it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=624.62s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=626.06s)]
*  Maybe we'll learn at some point. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=627.02s)]
*  Tanya Miller, thank you so much for your time explaining all of the legal components to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=628.7s)]
*  me and all of our viewers tonight. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=633.72s)]
*  Today, on what would have been Emmett Till's 82nd birthday, President Joe Biden signed a [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  proclamation designating a national monument to the murdered teenager and his mother. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=642.12s)]
*  Till was 14 years old in 1955 when he was tortured and murdered in Mississippi over accusations [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=647.08s)]
*  of whistling at a white woman. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=652.6400000000001s)]
*  Till's mother, as the president noted, insisted on an open casket funeral, a decision that [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  helped to galvanize the civil rights movement. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  The monument includes a bulletproof memorial sign where Till's body was found, installed [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=662.2199999999999s)]
*  in 2019 after previous markers were shot up. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=666.62s)]
*  Unfortunately, in 2023, the president could not simply mark the death of Till and the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  role it played in this in sparking the civil rights movement, because today, nearly 70 [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=675.78s)]
*  years later, there's an effort to erase history, to paper over the bad and the truth of our [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=681.02s)]
*  nation. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=687.4599999999999s)]
*  While darkness and denialism can hide much, they erase nothing. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=689.32s)]
*  They can hide, but they erase nothing. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=694.76s)]
*  We can't just choose to learn what we want to know. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=699.12s)]
*  We have to learn what we should know. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=703.08s)]
*  We should know about our country. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=705.52s)]
*  We should know everything. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=707.64s)]
*  The good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=708.64s)]
*  That's what great nations do. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=713.96s)]
*  Telling the truth and the full history of our nation is important. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=716.26s)]
*  We can't just choose to learn what we want to know. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=724.78s)]
*  We have to learn what we should know. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=727.5s)]
*  One glaring example of a state that is actively trying to bury what we should know as a part [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=730.38s)]
*  of American history is Florida, where the State Board of Education just approved a new [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=735.08s)]
*  educational curriculum, boosted by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who awkwardly defends [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=739.74s)]
*  his state's new guidelines while simultaneously pretending he has nothing to do with them. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=745.72s)]
*  I didn't do it, and I wasn't involved in it, but I think what they're doing is I think [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=751.84s)]
*  that they're probably going to show some of the folks that eventually parlayed being a [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=756.96s)]
*  blacksmith into doing things later in life. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=764.36s)]
*  Joining me now is Congressman Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=769.84s)]
*  Congressman, there's a lot we could talk about on the politics here and Ron DeSantis, but [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=773.24s)]
*  I do want to start with just what this means, because often this is shorthanded as a political [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=777.28s)]
*  issue and it has real consequences in Florida. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=782.16s)]
*  So how will the changes in the educational curriculum impact students in the state? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=784.96s)]
*  Well thanks for having me on. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=793.04s)]
*  It's going to have a big impact on students in the state, but you know, we're going to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=794.08s)]
*  be fighting against that with amazing leaders across the entire state that won't stand for [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=796.98s)]
*  this. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=801.7s)]
*  Not only do they want to erase black history and American history, they want to change [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=802.7s)]
*  it, and there's a reason why. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=806.9000000000001s)]
*  Last election, 70% of Gen Z voted for Democrats. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=808.82s)]
*  And so I think Republicans, especially this new neo-fascist movement growing in the country, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=813.46s)]
*  realizes that young people voting poses an existential threat to the far right-wing Republican [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=818.26s)]
*  party. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=824.58s)]
*  So what they're going to do, Jen, is they want to change education so they can change [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=825.58s)]
*  the mindset of a generation. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=829.24s)]
*  But little do they know, not only is that not going to work, it's just going to piss [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=831.6s)]
*  us off. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=835.32s)]
*  It's going to drive people to the polls, it's going to drive people to organize, and we [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=836.32s)]
*  won't let it happen in our state. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  You sound pretty pissed off, which I appreciate and value. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=841.96s)]
*  Now I know you sent a letter. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=845.2s)]
*  I assume you haven't heard back, but tell me if you have. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=846.84s)]
*  But what can you actually do to change the curriculum? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=850.0s)]
*  You're going to get people activated, get Gen Z pissed off, many are. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=852.68s)]
*  What can you do to change it? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=856.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, we've sent many letters in my seven-month tenure as a member of Congress. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  I've heard back from none of them. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=865.2199999999999s)]
*  All these letters have been to the governor's office or the state cabinet. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=868.0s)]
*  I've never heard back from them. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=871.0999999999999s)]
*  They have no interest in speaking with us. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  They have no interest in speaking with the people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=874.14s)]
*  The governor never hosts any town halls or wants to speak with constituents. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=875.9s)]
*  That's why I had to interrupt one of his speeches just about a year and a half ago [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=879.26s)]
*  during my campaign to learn about his plan to help kids stop dying in classrooms. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=882.68s)]
*  But what can we do? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=887.52s)]
*  We can organize. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=888.52s)]
*  We can ensure that we're electing good candidates. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=889.52s)]
*  We can fight back, send letters, protest to the State Board of Education to say we demand [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=891.52s)]
*  actual education, not a whitewashed version of education that seemingly wants to make [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=897.38s)]
*  our kids okay with slavery and white supremacy. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=902.92s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=907.74s)]
*  It's not what the Republican Party was founded on at all. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=909.62s)]
*  Again, it's this problem we're seeing in the state of Florida where we have Republican [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=912.22s)]
*  leaders who want to manufacture an issue, then say, I'm the hero here. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=916.08s)]
*  If you give me more power, I'll deal with it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=920.12s)]
*  We've seen authoritarian leaders do this before. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=922.86s)]
*  It's in the playbook, and we have to fight against it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=925.3800000000001s)]
*  We'll continue to do it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=927.4200000000001s)]
*  We're going to take it to the school boards. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=928.4200000000001s)]
*  We're going to take it to the state, and we're going to fight for actual education. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=929.4200000000001s)]
*  It's not about a left-wing education or a right-wing education. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=933.34s)]
*  It's about the real history of this country. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=936.1s)]
*  Speaking of activism, and you've been very active on a number of issues, you've been [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=939.74s)]
*  very supportive of your Texas colleague, Greg Caesar, and the thirst strike that he took [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=942.7s)]
*  part in today on the Capitol steps. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=947.86s)]
*  First of all, have you checked in with him? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=949.7s)]
*  How is he doing? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Greg is doing great. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  I actually saw him at the end of it when we just had votes. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=956.66s)]
*  You know, Greg, you look at someone like Greg, and this is the reason why it's important [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=960.02s)]
*  the Congress. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=964.78s)]
*  Texas has been having a huge problem with workers dying on the job because they don't [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=966.3399999999999s)]
*  have access to water. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=971.22s)]
*  They're not given breaks, and there's really something that the federal government can [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=972.4599999999999s)]
*  do here to step in and protect workers. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=975.6999999999999s)]
*  So Greg, today, since the morning, has been on a thirst strike in the hot sun on the Capitol [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=977.26s)]
*  steps to show just a little bit of what the workers are going through in Texas and also [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=982.18s)]
*  across the nation. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  So I joined him for about an hour because it's a problem everywhere, and this is why [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  we got to elect organizers who are going to, of course, hold our leaders accountable, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=991.06s)]
*  but as themselves as leaders, will show that they're in solidarity with the people. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=995.66s)]
*  So I'm honored to serve with my brother, Greg Caesar, and he's doing amazing work in Texas [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=998.8199999999999s)]
*  and for the country. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1002.8599999999999s)]
*  I also wanted to ask you about the climate. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1003.8599999999999s)]
*  I know you've been very outspoken on this crisis as well. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1006.54s)]
*  July is the hottest month on record, I believe, if I'm getting my facts straight there. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1009.4599999999999s)]
*  There's been activism among young people. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1015.88s)]
*  It's still a partisan issue, though, somehow. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1018.2199999999999s)]
*  How do you change that? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1020.42s)]
*  And how are you making—how are you building bridges on that front? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1022.34s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1026.66s)]
*  I actually just had a conversation this morning with Senator Ed Markey about this, and he [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1029.26s)]
*  was talking about the fact that the climate crisis is becoming such a problem to now every [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1033.7s)]
*  sector of society in Massachusetts, that he has big, big business owners, which I think [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1038.82s)]
*  typically folks wouldn't see them as allies in the climate crisis, coming to him and saying, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1043.88s)]
*  We need to do something about this. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1048.18s)]
*  It's now hurting my bottom line. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1049.62s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's what a lot of people just care about. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1051.3799999999999s)]
*  But hey, welcome to the fight nonetheless. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1053.98s)]
*  And we see the same thing in the state of Florida. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1056.3799999999999s)]
*  As the hurricanes get longer and worse because of the climate crisis, as it is continuing [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1059.06s)]
*  to decimate entire towns and cities in the state of Florida, I think we have a rude awakening [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1064.26s)]
*  upon us. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1069.54s)]
*  And what I want to tell people is the climate crisis is here. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1070.54s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1073.82s)]
*  We see it happening every day across the country. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1074.82s)]
*  However, we can still prevent the worst impact of it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1077.06s)]
*  And so we have a lot of work to do on it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1081.02s)]
*  But I think, Jen, unfortunately, you know, there are consequences coming and that are [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1082.78s)]
*  here. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1086.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think that will shake a lot of people and put people in the action. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1087.8600000000001s)]
*  But again, the good news is, good news is we still have time. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4hiID0Fwu4&t=1090.54s)]
