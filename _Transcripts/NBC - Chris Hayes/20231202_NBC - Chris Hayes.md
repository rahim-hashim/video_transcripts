# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Dec. 1
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We've got huge developments tonight in two of the trials of Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=0.0s)]
*  Just within the last half hour, Judge Tonya Chutkin, who was overseeing the federal criminal case about January 6th in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election, issued a withering rejection of the ex-president's attempt to get his criminal case thrown out of court. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=6.0s)]
*  Trump and his lawyers had argued that he had total presidential immunity and so the case should be dismissed outright. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=22.0s)]
*  Chutkin rejected that argument, saying in part, quote, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=29.0s)]
*  Defendants for your services commander in chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=33.0s)]
*  Now, this ruling in that criminal case comes today in the wake of a federal appeals court ruling that Donald Trump can face legal accountability for inciting the insurrection on January 6th in a civil case. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=43.0s)]
*  That case brought by Capitol police officers and lawmakers who sued Donald Trump back in 2021. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=55.0s)]
*  As the Washington Post explains, they brought the suit under a roughly 150 year old law designed to combat KKK violence after the Civil War. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=61.0s)]
*  They argue Trump violated that statute, barring the use of force, threats or intimidation to prevent government officials from carrying out their duties by conspiring with members of far right groups to keep lawmakers from confirming the results of the 2020 election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=71.0s)]
*  Again, similarly in that case, Donald Trump and his lawyers claimed that as they had in the federal case to steal the election, that he had absolute immunity as president, that he could not be held civilly liable or accountable for his actions around the attempted coup. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=85.0s)]
*  Now, all that is a clear embodiment of the dictatorial powers that Donald Trump wants to ascribe to the presidency, at least when he occupies it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=100.0s)]
*  While he was still in office, Trump repeatedly spoke about his absolute power to do whatever he likes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=109.0s)]
*  I have the right to do whatever I want as president, but I don't even talk about that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=115.0s)]
*  It gives me all of these rights at a level that nobody has ever seen before. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=121.0s)]
*  When somebody's the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that's the way it's got to be. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=126.0s)]
*  The authority is total. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=133.0s)]
*  After he left the White House, as the legal pressure increased, Trump zeroed in on this defense, declaring at the end of last year, quote, as president, I have total immunity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=135.0s)]
*  Just a few months ago, his lawyers in the federal elections case made the argument plainly on national television. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=144.0s)]
*  Everything that President Trump did was while he was in office as a president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=151.0s)]
*  He is now immune from prosecution for acts that he takes in connection with those policy decisions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=156.0s)]
*  So according to Donald Trump and his lawyers, the president of the United States can just do whatever he wants. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=163.0s)]
*  He can never be held accountable for any of it, of things he did while in office, even after he leaves office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=167.0s)]
*  This is Trump's view of presidential power. It is the view he will embody if he is reelected next year. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=174.0s)]
*  It is the view that Judge Tonya Chutkin knocked down today in the federal criminal case and the circuit court in Washington, D.C., also knocked down today in that civil case. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=179.0s)]
*  The chief judge in that case explained, quote, when the president acts outside the functions of his office, he does not continue to enjoy immunity from damages liability just because he happens to be the president. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=190.0s)]
*  When he acts in an unofficial private capacity, he is subject to civil suits like any private citizen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=200.0s)]
*  When a first term president opts to seek a second term, his campaign to win reelection is not an official presidential act. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=205.0s)]
*  And Trump himself recognized that he engaged in his campaign to win reelection, including his post-election efforts to alter the declared results in his favor, in his personal capacity as presidential candidate, not in his official capacity as sitting president. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=212.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear on that civil case, right, the lawsuit, it's not the final ruling on the plaintiff's argument. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=225.0s)]
*  So it will allow the case to go forward, give them a chance to prove that Trump broke the law and that they were injured as a result. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=231.0s)]
*  But again, in just 24 hours, right, both of these rulings, huge and hugely needed, providing some perspective on what actual judges think of Trump's claims of absolute and total immunity. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=238.0s)]
*  The United States Constitution makes it very hard to expel a sitting member of Congress. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=253.0s)]
*  Quote, each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=257.0s)]
*  A two-thirds majority is an extraordinarily high bar to reach, and that makes sense. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=265.0s)]
*  I mean, in most cases, it's the voters that should be the ones to decide who stays or goes in Congress. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=269.0s)]
*  So in order for someone to actually get expelled, they really got to do something particularly egregious. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=274.0s)]
*  The last example was Ohio Democratic Congressman James Trafkin, who was expelled in 2002 after getting convicted on corruption charges. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=279.0s)]
*  He did not go quietly. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=289.0s)]
*  I'll go to jail, but I'll be damned if I'll be pressured by a government that pressured these witnesses to death to get a conviction on a target, the number one target in the country. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=292.0s)]
*  Today, Congressman George Santos did not go quietly either. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=309.0s)]
*  The indicted New York Republican was finally expelled from the House by a truly overwhelming margin, nearly three to one. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=312.0s)]
*  That's less than a full year after he was sworn into office. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=318.0s)]
*  As a New York Times notes, this is, quote, the first time since the Civil War that a member has been removed without a criminal conviction. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=321.0s)]
*  For his part, Santos told reporters, quote, Why would I want to stay here to hell with this place? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=330.0s)]
*  And thus ends one of the truly strangest chapters in the 234-year history of the U.S. House of Representatives. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=336.0s)]
*  I'm joined now by someone who is there to witness it up close and someone who's documented this story for history. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=343.0s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman is a Democrat of New York who is at the forefront of the effort to expel Santos. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=348.0s)]
*  Mark Cisano, who started covering Santos in 2019 as a columnist and editorial writer at the Long Island newspaper Newsday and has authored the brand new book, The Fabulist, The Lying, Hustling, Grifting, Sealing, and Very American Legend of George Santos, which is out now. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=352.0s)]
*  Good to have you here. Congressman Goldman. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=366.0s)]
*  It was, I think, a little this is a third attempt. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=368.0s)]
*  Expulsion votes are rare, successful expulsion votes even rare, successful expulsion votes not pursuant to a conviction, unprecedented. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=371.0s)]
*  Your reaction to today's news? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=380.0s)]
*  Well, I think we're getting a little over out of our skis by talking about how unprecedented this is that there was no criminal conviction. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=384.0s)]
*  It's also unprecedented effectively. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=392.0s)]
*  I'm not positive, but unheard of that the Ethics Committee would release a report prior to the resolution of a criminal case. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=395.0s)]
*  Ordinarily, the Ethics Committee refers to the Department of Justice. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=403.0s)]
*  So the House of Representatives is not obligated to operate under rules of a criminal court. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=407.0s)]
*  We have our own rules based on the Constitution, based on the rules that have been set forth. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=415.0s)]
*  George Santos was provided with due process through the Ethics Committee. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=421.0s)]
*  He declined to participate, he declined to be interviewed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=425.0s)]
*  But and then they did an investigation and released a report that was incredibly damning, worse than I think even I could have imagined. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=428.0s)]
*  And I filed the original complaint to the Ethics Committee for them to do this investigation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=436.0s)]
*  So at some point it becomes just a simple question of whether or not George Santos violated the rules of the House and deserves to continue to be a member of Congress, one of the 435 most powerful people who make our laws. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=442.0s)]
*  And it wasn't much more complicated than that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=459.0s)]
*  And this idea of precedent and innocent, but not innocent until proven guilty, it's all bunk. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=461.0s)]
*  That exists in a courtroom where your liberty is at stake. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=468.0s)]
*  That is not the Congressional standard. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=472.0s)]
*  That is not anything that anyone needs to work with. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=474.0s)]
*  I am perfectly comfortable as a member of Congress to say that the precedent that either there's an Ethics Committee report or a criminal conviction is enough. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=477.0s)]
*  Remove someone, fine. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=488.0s)]
*  If you meet either of those standards, okay. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, just to be clear, I don't think unprecedented necessarily means bad. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=493.0s)]
*  I mean, to me, what's interesting here is that I think he was unprecedented. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=498.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing you pointed out. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=503.0s)]
*  Like, I think what Santos pulled off was unprecedented. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=505.0s)]
*  He basically, effectively and comprehensively defrauded the voters of his district to get himself elected. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=508.0s)]
*  And then it was revealed probably was defrauding to a criminal extent, although this is just alleged at this point, a whole bunch of people throughout his entire life. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=517.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any precedent for him, a guy like that, getting elected to Congress. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=525.0s)]
*  I mean, the first conversation I had with him, I write about this in the book. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=528.0s)]
*  This is kind of the very first time, 2019, and I call him and I've written about sketchy politicians before, but you know, this is Long Island. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=532.0s)]
*  But I give him a call and he says, I'm launching my campaign today, but I'm in Florida right now. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=539.0s)]
*  And this is the New York district, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=545.0s)]
*  Why are you launching your campaign in Florida where he is on business? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=546.0s)]
*  And he also, by the way, didn't have his campaign finance filings up yet. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=549.0s)]
*  You know, everything was there right at the beginning. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=553.0s)]
*  How weird this guy was. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=554.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=556.0s)]
*  And I wonder, too, Congressman Goldman, let me ask you this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=557.0s)]
*  This was, there was an interesting thing happened among the New York delegation. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=560.0s)]
*  The New York delegation was, I think, understandably took this quite personally, that they were serving next to this individual. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=565.0s)]
*  And I think across the bipartisan lines wanted to get rid of him. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=571.0s)]
*  There's also some degree to which it seemed like the Republican members in those frontline districts who are going to have to face the voters in districts that are, you know, were plus Biden districts. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=574.0s)]
*  It's useful for them to be like, we're not like this guy, George Santos. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=584.0s)]
*  Don't throw him in with him. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=589.0s)]
*  What do you think about that aspect of it? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=590.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, let's focus on Elise Stefanik right now, who was George Santos, biggest backer, biggest supporter and voted to vote for Biden. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=593.0s)]
*  And voted to protect him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=600.0s)]
*  She's the conference chair of the Republican Party and also a New York member. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=601.0s)]
*  The other freshman members in much more vulnerable districts did an interesting bait and switch. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=606.0s)]
*  In May, when we first brought the expulsion motion up, they were the ones who moved to table it, which meant move just to kick it down the road and protect George Santos. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=613.0s)]
*  Then about a month ago, before the ethics report had come out, nothing had materially had changed from May. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=623.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, they realized that politically George Santos was a liability for them. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=631.0s)]
*  So then they initiated an expulsion motion so they could say they were trying to remove him. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=638.0s)]
*  That failed. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=644.0s)]
*  Many members wanted to wait for the ethics committee report. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=645.0s)]
*  So this was just purely political from the New York Republicans who wanted to distance themselves from George Santos when they realized that he rightly so is such a political liability for them. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=649.0s)]
*  But in reality, more than half of the Republican Party voted to protect George Santos, notwithstanding the egregious misconduct that was laid out in that report. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=661.0s)]
*  Here's my question for you, Mark, who's sort of there from the beginning, which is like when you take a step back. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=672.0s)]
*  The big question that I had in the beginning is still there, which is like, how did so many systems fail for this guy? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=677.0s)]
*  Like, I think we now can all say this guy never should have been a member of Congress. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=684.0s)]
*  And that's that has been the judgment of three quarters of the House. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=687.0s)]
*  I think it's the judgment of the people in this district. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=690.0s)]
*  How did it happen? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=692.0s)]
*  Why did it happen? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=693.0s)]
*  Well, so one of the things that I kind of looked into in the book is that is the scientific literature behind lying. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=694.0s)]
*  Right. And it actually is very difficult to figure out if someone's lying. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=699.0s)]
*  One way you do that is to almost like make someone tell the story backwards. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=702.0s)]
*  And I think that's like a way to look at how hard it is to find people out who are lying about everything. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=706.0s)]
*  And so there were a lot. There were people poking holes in his stories. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rXegpunmw&t=712.0s)]
