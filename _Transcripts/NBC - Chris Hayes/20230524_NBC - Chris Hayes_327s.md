# Oath Keepers to receive first seditious conspiracy sentences over Jan. 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs)
*  Hearings are now underway for the oath keepers convicted of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=0.0s)]
*  seditious conspiracy and other charges for their participation [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=2.7s)]
*  January 6th. Today, a federal judge heard victim statements, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  including from Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who said he [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=10.56s)]
*  continues to seek therapy, quote, to learn how to heal from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  January 6th. He's taken such a toll on me, as well as Virginia [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=16.78s)]
*  Brown, who was just a college student working as a Senate [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=20.82s)]
*  assistant seen here on the right, carrying the actual [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=23.72s)]
*  physical electoral ballots right before the attack. He said [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=26.96s)]
*  in court, quote, I constantly relive the memories of that day. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  I cannot measure how many hours of sleep I've lost. Prosecutors [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=34.56s)]
*  are asking the judge for what would be the longest sentences [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=38.28s)]
*  yet in all the January 6 cases, including 25 years for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=41.28s)]
*  Oathkeeper Founder Elmer Stewart-Rose III on the right, and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=45.36s)]
*  21 years for member Kelly Meggs. Prosecutors say they, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=48.8s)]
*  along with seven other oath keepers, played a, quote, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=52.92s)]
*  central and damning role in the attack on American democracy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=55.16s)]
*  And as a co-conspirator recognized, these actions made [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=58.88s)]
*  these defendants traitors. NBC News justice reporter Ryan Riley [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=61.76s)]
*  was in the courtroom today and he joins me now. Ryan, it's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=66.04s)]
*  great to have you. What was today's hearing and what was it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=68.56s)]
*  like in there? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=71.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know, to me, the thing that really stood out was that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=73.88s)]
*  Virginia Brown testimony, just because it's something that we [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=75.7s)]
*  really haven't heard before. And just, you know, just if you step [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=77.7s)]
*  back for a moment and think about this young woman's life, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=80.62s)]
*  you know, she was someone who, if you just do the math, was [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=83.9s)]
*  born after 9-11, you know, probably spent her entire life [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  going through these sort of drills that we've seen, you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=89.7s)]
*  know, that kids who go to school have to go through these days to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=92.86000000000001s)]
*  prepare for disastrous incidents and then talked about how she, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  you know, took off her shoes and was running for her life, you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  know, during this attack on the Capitol. And this was someone [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=102.7s)]
*  who was, had just, you know, I think was a freshman probably in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=105.34s)]
*  college when the COVID-19 pandemic started and then, you [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=108.22s)]
*  know, gets this experience of working in the Senate and then [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=112.84s)]
*  has this horrific incident happen to her there. And, you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  know, what was striking, I mean, the composure that she kept in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=119.04s)]
*  court, you know, and it just, it was really, I think, emotional [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=121.72s)]
*  for a lot of the people who were there, including some of the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=126.16s)]
*  testimony that we saw from officers as well as from Nancy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=128.6s)]
*  Pelosi's staff. But, you know, I was in another sentencing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=132.16s)]
*  hearing, and it is this kind of thing where you can get a little [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=134.96s)]
*  bit sort of just like used to this and, you know, okay, how [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=138.36s)]
*  many times are we going to hear this at some point? And one thing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=141.96s)]
*  that the prosecutor made a point of mentioning in this other [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=144.56s)]
*  hearing was that, you know, the officers are getting tired of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=148.44s)]
*  doing this too. You know, some of the times we don't have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=151.08s)]
*  victims who are actually speaking these things because [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=154.4s)]
*  this has been two years of them having to go in court over and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  over again and tell these stories and make sure that they're [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  held accountable. And it's really important work, but it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=161.88s)]
*  can also be quite a grind, I think, for these officers who [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  have gone through a lot and have to relive that day over and over [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  again. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=169.4s)]
*  I was struck by some of the language throughout this trial, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  right? That the seditious conspiracy and the kind of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=173.12s)]
*  almost sort of symbolic or rhetorical role it plays in the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=177.16s)]
*  conversation about what happened that day. There was an actual [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=183.2s)]
*  conspiracy to overthrow the government, you know, according [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=185.56s)]
*  to the law, according to this conviction. And the penalties [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  that the government are seeking here are really the high, am I [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  right? Like the highest for any of the folks that have been [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=194.04s)]
*  convicted so far. How does the government justify and ask for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=197.6s)]
*  25 years, which is, you know, there are people who do less [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=202.56s)]
*  than that for homicide. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=205.44s)]
*  I think with Rhodes, it's really about the rhetoric. I mean, he [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=207.76s)]
*  was just so out there with some of the rhetoric and talking [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=210.2s)]
*  about what he wanted to do beforehand, as well as Kelly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=212.6s)]
*  Meggs. Kelly Meggs especially has a lot of really just violent [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=215.0s)]
*  rhetoric about in the lead up to January 6 and the pre planning [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  that they were doing for this. And I think, you know, honestly, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=221.4s)]
*  we're going to hear quite something from Rhodes tomorrow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=224.04s)]
*  It's sort of, I was thinking about other terrorism sort of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  related cases. And, you know, there's this idea of not wanting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=229.68s)]
*  to spread propaganda from terrorists. That's a big thing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=232.96s)]
*  from from courts and like, how is that really going to play out [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  tomorrow? Because he's going to use this moment to really make as [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=240.24s)]
*  much of a stand as he can. He's already been doing it, and in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=243.04s)]
*  whatever sort of spaces he can he can bring out. But I think [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=245.68s)]
*  that this is going to be his real moment, you know, there's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=248.2s)]
*  not going to be cameras in the courtroom. So it's not going to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=249.84s)]
*  be something that's going to be broadcast on live television. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=251.68s)]
*  But, you know, you're really going to wonder what kind of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=254.44s)]
*  message he's going to come out from this because he wants to go [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=256.24s)]
*  down like he thinks of himself as Nelson Mandela. So he's going [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=258.8s)]
*  to really make this as much of a moment as he can, I think, and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=261.76s)]
*  probably outside of what his lawyers would want him to say, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=265.68s)]
*  because, you know, I mean, even if he gets a 20 year sentence, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=269.32s)]
*  we're basically bordering on life for him, right? Like that's, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=272.08s)]
*  that's, that's basically a life sentence, essentially. So it's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=276.08s)]
*  going to be really, I think, interesting to see how this ends [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=280.8s)]
*  up playing out and whether or not he makes this his final, you [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=283.24s)]
*  know, stand and tries to potentially rally other people [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  to do similar things to what the Oath Keepers did on January 6. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=289.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it would be a life something close to a life [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=292.8s)]
*  sentence, of course, pending the possibility of a future pardon [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=295.32s)]
*  by President Donald Trump, which the president has, if not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=298.04s)]
*  specifically floored about him, definitely entertained multiple [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=301.52s)]
*  times. Ryan Reilly, thank you very much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lAxwXsFGs&t=304.52s)]
