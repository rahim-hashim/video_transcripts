Video Description: Congresswoman Lauren Boebert claimed she skipped the debt ceiling vote in protest. But new video seems to prove otherwise. “I guess it's not a huge surprise, given Lauren Boebert has a pretty loose relationship with facts,” says Jen Psaki.

# New video disputes Lauren Boebert's claim about vote she 'protested'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA)
*  So last week, the bipartisan deal to avoid defaulting on our national debt passed with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=0.0s)]
*  overwhelming majorities in Congress over the objections of mainly a group of far-right [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=5.04s)]
*  Republicans. One of those outspoken critics was Congresswoman Lauren Boebert of Colorado, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=10.08s)]
*  no surprise, who repeatedly promised to vote against the bill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  The bill Biden negotiated fuels inflation, adds trillions to our debt, and leaves a blank check [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=20.64s)]
*  for more of the same nonsense I came here to stop. I am not for an unlimited debt ceiling [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  increase. As presented today, I'm voting no. You heard her. She's pretty incensed there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=33.44s)]
*  I'm voting no. So it seemed a bit strange when Lauren Boebert just didn't show up at all to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=40.8s)]
*  vote on Wednesday. Over the weekend, the congressman posted a video claiming she skipped the vote in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=46.08s)]
*  protest. Hey, everyone. I am back in Colorado, but let's talk about D.C. No excuses. I was ticked [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  off. They wouldn't let me do my job, so I didn't take the vote. Once again, Washington's power [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=59.28s)]
*  machine shoved a multi-trillion dollar bill down our throats, refused to allow debate or amendments, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=64.16s)]
*  disregarded everything we fought for in January to actually allow representatives to do their jobs, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=70.32s)]
*  and instead they served us up a crap sandwich. Call it a no-show protest, but I certainly let [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=77.28s)]
*  every one of my colleagues and the country know I was against this garbage of a bill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=84.56s)]
*  A no-show protest to a crap sandwich. It's quite a phrase, according to the congresswoman. But as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=90.16s)]
*  it turns out, that doesn't seem to be actually what happened. A Capitol Hill producer caught Lauren [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Boebert on tape frantically running into the building Wednesday evening, too late to vote. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=100.72s)]
*  They just closed it. They closed it? Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah. I can't stop watching that. And Boebert actually admitted that she was late and missed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=115.36s)]
*  the vote on the congressional record, saying that she was unavoidably detained, and if she, quote, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=122.16s)]
*  had been present, she would have voted nay. So it's sort of like saying, if I hadn't slept [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=128.96s)]
*  through my alarm, I swear I would have aced that test. It's almost as if she didn't think [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=134.72s)]
*  anyone would check. No one was tracking. I guess it's not a huge surprise, given Lauren Boebert [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=139.2s)]
*  has a pretty loose relationship with facts, and I can tell you she wouldn't be the first on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=143.68s)]
*  President Biden's call sheet of Republicans. But there are lots of Republicans that this president [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=148.4s)]
*  can find common cause with, showing his willingness to extend olive branches across the aisle is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=153.36s)]
*  basically part of what got him elected in 2020. It was part of his strategy and a big part of the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=158.24s)]
*  strategy going into 2024. Much more of that coming up next. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZksk5n_lIA&t=162.88s)]
