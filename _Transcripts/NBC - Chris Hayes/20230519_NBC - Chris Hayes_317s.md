# Hayes: GOP candidates have rendered climate invisible from the 2024 race
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM)
*  Dozens of wildfires in Western Canada are generating immense amounts of smoke that are drifting across the country into the U.S., [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=0.0s)]
*  sparking air quality alerts in parts of five U.S. states today, even there in Wisconsin. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=7.84s)]
*  Young children, the elderly, people with health conditions in those areas are being advised to stay inside. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Now, obviously, wildfires are a seasonal hazard, but it's May and it's in Canada, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=19.12s)]
*  and fire season there usually doesn't peak until July. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=25.12s)]
*  But of course, hotter temperatures and much longer fire seasons are part of the new climate reality. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=28.72s)]
*  Right now, the average global temperature is one degree Celsius warmer than in the late 1800s. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  We've warmed at one degree. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=40.56s)]
*  When I started covering climate 15 years ago, 20 years ago, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=42.16s)]
*  a global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius degrees was viewed as the real danger threshold [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  because anything over that was going to get real, real ugly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  This week, we got word from scientists that it is very likely we will hit that threshold, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=58.96s)]
*  one and a half degrees, by 2027. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=63.68s)]
*  So the old window of what used to be considered the outer bounds of what we can deal with, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  we're likely going to hit that within the next five years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=71.92s)]
*  And of course, with one degree, we are already seeing, and we are going to see more of, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=75.6s)]
*  an unfathomable amount of human misery across the globe, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=80.72s)]
*  as the destruction and economic damage from climate change [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=84.24s)]
*  forces people to flee their homes and to become refugees. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=87.36s)]
*  It is the number one challenge in the world, as it has been, and it is only becoming more so. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=92.16s)]
*  A civilizational challenge, unprecedented in scale and scope. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  And it is really striking that as we begin the official 2024 campaign with people like Tim Scott, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Nikki Haley, and Ron DeSantis, jumping in to challenge the ex-president for the Republican [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=107.52s)]
*  nomination, this issue, the most important one, the central civilizational challenge of our time, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  is utterly and completely absent and ignored from all Republican political campaign discourse. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  I was thinking this the other day when I saw that Glenn Youngkin, the flashy new video suggesting [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  maybe he might be thinking about running in 2024. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  It almost seemed like a joke, like a comedic schtick to wonder, well, what's his climate plan? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=132.72s)]
*  Because of course it's preposterous. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=139.12s)]
*  The I don't think he has one or will have one because Republicans don't care, truly do not care [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=141.36s)]
*  if we melt the earth. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=149.2s)]
*  They are either in denial or they're actively on the side of the polluters. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=150.0s)]
*  But it is actually the single most important question for anyone running for president. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=154.56s)]
*  What are you going to do to meet the targets we have to meet to decarbonize as rapidly as we have [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=159.2s)]
*  to to have a chance of not heating the planet to two, three, four degrees Celsius? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=164.56s)]
*  Now, in the case of the incumbent president, Joe Biden, he got the Inflation Reduction Act passed, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=171.68s)]
*  the first ever climate legislation that we've had, really, which by itself is insufficient, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=175.68s)]
*  but so far has been successful beyond all expectations. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=182.0s)]
*  Demands for tax credits for things like wind and solar projects and electric cars are exceeding [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=186.0s)]
*  projections or seeing real movement in the energy transition for the first time. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=190.4s)]
*  Sales of energy efficient heat pumps are now outpacing traditional fossil fuel [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=195.84s)]
*  furnaces in people's homes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=200.16s)]
*  We may be about to get a huge boom in the use of its hydrogen for industrial purposes, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=201.68s)]
*  which is a game changer. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=205.52s)]
*  So that's the first part of the change, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=207.76s)]
*  We need way, way more investment from where that came from, more things like the IRA. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=210.32s)]
*  But the Republican Party doesn't care or talk about that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=215.76s)]
*  It just doesn't exist in their universe. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=219.6s)]
*  Instead, what they do is go to bat on behalf of the fossil fuel companies to try to destroy [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  the energy transition. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=227.28s)]
*  That is what they're doing right now in this fight over the debt ceiling, their demand to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=228.48s)]
*  repeal most of the new tax credits that make energy cheaper and cleaner and to allow more [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=232.88s)]
*  drilling for fossil fuels. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=237.68s)]
*  Those are part of the demands of the House negotiators who briefly paused debt ceiling [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=240.16s)]
*  talks today to extract more leverage over the White House. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=244.64s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Drill, baby, drill. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=248.4s)]
*  Here we are 15 years later, essentially the guiding ethos of the whole party and all the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=249.36s)]
*  candidates. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=253.52s)]
*  And so we're just stuck in this bizarre situation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=254.88s)]
*  The most pressing challenge in the world, the most important thing to have a position [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=259.6s)]
*  on and a plan for, Republicans have succeeded in rendering completely invisible in the number [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=265.76s)]
*  one political contest in the country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=272.32s)]
*  And I guess what I would say was I would urge fellow journalists, particularly political and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=274.64s)]
*  campaign journalists, not to collude in that erasure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=279.11999999999995s)]
*  Because of course, the climate doesn't care whether we talk about it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=284.0s)]
*  It's going to make itself known either way. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=288.08s)]
*  Just ask the folks choking on all that smoke. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVNmq03F0iM&t=291.12s)]
