# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Nov. 22
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw)
*  Today, new documents in the New York fraud case against Donald Trump reveal that the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=0.0s)]
*  ex-president's attacks on the judge's clerk resulted in, and I'm quoting here, hundreds [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  of threatening her and harassing messages against her. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=11.1s)]
*  According to this filing by an officer in the court's Judicial Threats Assessment Unit, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=14.34s)]
*  the clerk's personal information, including her personal cell phone number, had been compromised, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=18.26s)]
*  resulting in daily doxing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=23.22s)]
*  She has been subject to, on a daily basis, harassing, disparaging comments and anti-Semitic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=25.46s)]
*  tropes, which the officer notes increased in number when Donald Trump violated a gag [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=30.380000000000003s)]
*  order aimed at preventing him from making public comments about the court staff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=35.28s)]
*  A New York appeals court issued a pause on that gag order last week, which will remain [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  in place at least for Monday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=43.44s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal analyst. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Katherine Christian is a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  and they both join me now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=51.66s)]
*  Lisa, let me just start with you on who made this filing and what context did we get this information? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=53.919999999999995s)]
*  So we got this filing on behalf of Judge Ngoran, made by the Office of Court Administration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=59.22s)]
*  There's a lawyer there who is effectively representing him in this proceeding. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=64.52s)]
*  And you might ask, why does he need his own lawyer here? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=68.06s)]
*  It's because this isn't an ordinary appeal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  This is a particular type of lawsuit in New York State where you can sue a governmental [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  official for unconstitutional or unlawful actions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=77.42s)]
*  So what Trump is doing here is suing Judge Ngoran himself, and therefore the Office of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=81.42s)]
*  Court Administration is stepping in as his lawyer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=86.64s)]
*  The affirmation that you're referring to was filed by basically the equivalent of a police [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=89.72s)]
*  officer for the court system who works for the Judicial Threats Assessment Unit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  You worked in New York City in the court system. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=99.2s)]
*  Still do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  And still do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  This kind of thing directed at a clerk of the court. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=105.84s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing, right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=109.76s)]
*  So if you run for district attorney in Manhattan, you're going to take some incoming, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  Like there's going to be people saying nasty things about you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  You may have to worry a little bit about security. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=118.14s)]
*  But you know that when you're doing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=120.64s)]
*  Not to say that it's okay, but it's just a little bit of a different thing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  A court clerk, like have you ever encountered a situation in the time that you've worked [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=125.22s)]
*  in the New York City court system of that level of public harassment targeted at someone [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=130.02s)]
*  like that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  Unheard of. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  A judge's law clerk. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  It's just, I don't want to say they're a potted plant. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=138.06s)]
*  When you go to court as a lawyer, you don't really, you don't deal with the law clerk. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes judges will have the law clerk speak to the attorneys to help with settlement. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  But it's the judge that makes the decision. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  So in this case, not just Donald Trump, to have the lawyers that have been attacking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=150.88s)]
*  this law clerk is just unprecedented. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  It's just unheard of. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=159.76s)]
*  And it's not just, you know, it's one thing if you're this clerk, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=160.76s)]
*  And you have been against your will, elevated to a public figure by one of the most, you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  know, the biggest platforms in the person Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  It's one thing for people to say nasty things about you out in the world and the internet. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=174.10000000000002s)]
*  It's horrible, but that's one level. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  What's revealed in this filing is that like she's getting 50 phone calls a day or something. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  I mean, her life is disrupted. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=185.38000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, she's been doxxed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=187.58s)]
*  Her address is in the public domain. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=189.28000000000003s)]
*  Her personal emails have been compromised. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=191.56s)]
*  Her personal cell phone has been compromised. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=193.74s)]
*  She gets dozens of messages, as you mentioned, on her social media, her personal email and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=196.18s)]
*  her personal cell phone every day. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=200.28s)]
*  And the threatening phone messages and voicemails that have been directed at the judge and the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=203.28s)]
*  clerk combined fill 275 single space pages as transcribed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=208.16s)]
*  To me, that was the thing about this filing that stood out the most was just the sheer [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  volume of the hate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=218.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, but this is just this is unacceptable, entirely unacceptable. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=220.28s)]
*  Like we can't I'm sorry. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=226.6s)]
*  We cannot run a system like this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  It cannot be the case that you can use the leverage your platform to essentially like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=230.3s)]
*  by other means, paint a target of intimidation upon like a court. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=235.74s)]
*  This is like I feel like I'm reading about some dystopian state where the rule of law [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=239.86s)]
*  has unraveled. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=243.38000000000002s)]
*  And it shows this is proof. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  If you want proof that Donald Trump's words when he attacks someone has the effect of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  encouraging threatening behavior threatens. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=251.34s)]
*  This is proof. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=254.82000000000002s)]
*  This poor law clerk here, who he puts her photo up and he also linked to her personal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  Instagram on that social media. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=260.98s)]
*  And it just started and it hasn't stopped. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  This also just seems a real test of me for me. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=266.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you've got you've got the protective order that Judge Chuckin issued, which is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  now being appealed and working its way through. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=272.22s)]
*  And again, Donald Trump is the amazing example of you get as much process on the U.S. system [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=274.18s)]
*  of justice as you can afford. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=278.22s)]
*  Not everyone gets this much process, but Donald Trump does, which fine, great. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=280.38s)]
*  That's his constitutional right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=283.7s)]
*  I wish everyone had it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=284.7s)]
*  But like that's working its way up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=286.0s)]
*  This someone's got to draw some real hard lines here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=287.92s)]
*  I really feel like I'm watching this like ridiculous testing thing happening where I [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  can see what's happening. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  I can see what the threat is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  Like I don't I don't know why I'm getting worked up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=297.56s)]
*  I just find this like completely unbearable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=300.24s)]
*  Well, Chris, you know that I've been sitting in this courtroom for weeks and days on that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=301.96s)]
*  And I've been watching this trial and to watch that law clerk and Judge Nguyen come to do [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=306.08s)]
*  their jobs every day and steal themselves to preside over a trial in which they are [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  daily attacked is really hard, hard to watch. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=315.26s)]
*  But in terms of drawing lines, it shouldn't also be the case that you only get to make [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=319.7s)]
*  this showing if you're represented by the court system. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=324.46s)]
*  You know, in some respects, Judge Nguyen and his law clerk were very lucky in that there [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=327.26s)]
*  is a police officer who is able to dimension the size and scope of the threat. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=331.38s)]
*  But Fonny Willis had some trouble yesterday in a similar hearing with respect to Harrison [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=337.2s)]
*  Floyd and his bond revocation because he's one of the co-defendants in that Georgia [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  Rico case. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=345.84s)]
*  He's a publicist who's associated with that weird episode in which a woman went down to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=346.84s)]
*  try to get the the two election poll workers to falsely confess. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=352.84s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=357.68s)]
*  And she had some trouble demonstrating yesterday that Harrison Floyd's posts about this woman, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=358.84s)]
*  Ruby Freeman, an election worker, were in fact threats. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=365.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=368.34s)]
*  Because there's nobody appointed by the government who was writing them down or transcribing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=369.34s)]
*  them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=373.18s)]
*  And it shouldn't be the case that you should have to report to police or get the police [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=374.18s)]
*  involved for a judge to believe that's a credible threat that violates conditions of release [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=376.78s)]
*  or a gag order that's in place. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=383.54s)]
*  I mean, look, the First Amendment is really important and there are novel First Amendment [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=385.54s)]
*  issues here where the person who's running for president, the court, there is and I really [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=388.82s)]
*  I pay deference to those. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=392.6s)]
*  But there's something insidious here, Catherine, that it's like when Trump tweets, Mike Pence [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=394.12s)]
*  didn't have the courage while the mob is overfilling the Capitol. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=398.9s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=401.72s)]
*  We all know what he's doing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=402.76s)]
*  In some technical sense, you could say like he didn't technically tell the mob, go try [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=404.18s)]
*  to kill that dude. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=409.86s)]
*  But like two plus two does equal four. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=412.08s)]
*  And he's doing the same thing here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=414.22s)]
*  And someone has to be able to say two plus two equals four. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=415.68s)]
*  We now have what we call a pattern of behavior. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=418.26s)]
*  You sort of put all the pieces together, say that constantly about Mike Pence and then [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=421.66s)]
*  what do we hear? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=425.98s)]
*  Hang Mike Pence and the Secret Service has to take him away. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=426.98s)]
*  So he constantly does this drumbeat. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=430.5s)]
*  I hope that the D.C. Circuit reads this affidavit that was filed in this New York Appellate [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=433.5s)]
*  Division and, you know, judges pay attention and we'll see what the cause and effect is [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=438.94s)]
*  when Donald Trump speaks. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=447.62s)]
*  We're waiting on that order out of the D.C. Circuit as well. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=450.12s)]
*  We're waiting on a resolution on this lawsuit against Judge Angora and Lisa Rubin and Katherine [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=455.58s)]
*  Christian. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=459.7s)]
*  Great to have you both. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=460.7s)]
*  This week, the United Auto Workers announced that its members at each of the big three [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=463.7s)]
*  U.S. automakers had officially ratified their newly negotiated contract. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=467.18s)]
*  According to the union, 64 percent of workers across Ford, Atlantis and General Motors voted [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  in favor of the deal, won by the union after a six-week strike. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=476.44s)]
*  And in an enduring lesson about the power of labor unions, the new contract brought [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=481.2s)]
*  gains beyond UAW membership. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=485.36s)]
*  At least half a dozen non-union automakers, Hyundai, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=487.6s)]
*  Volkswagen all announced they would raise the pay of their U.S. auto workers most roughly [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=493.32s)]
*  in line with the UAW contract. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  This cements the longest auto worker strike in 25 years as not only a huge success for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=500.76s)]
*  the UAW, but a success for all auto workers across the industry. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  And a reminder of the impact a unionized workforce can have on the distribution between wages [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=509.62s)]
*  and profits. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=515.02s)]
*  Joining me now for an exclusive interview, the man who led the union in that strike, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=516.02s)]
*  Sean Fain, President, United Auto Workers of America. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=520.58s)]
*  Congratulations on this very successful undertaking. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=524.22s)]
*  How stressed out were you about how long this might go? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=530.24s)]
*  Hey, Chris, thanks for having us. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=535.24s)]
*  That's an honor to be here. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=538.04s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I really wasn't stressed out about how long it takes because we knew [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=539.04s)]
*  we had the power of the membership behind us. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=542.76s)]
*  We had a membership because of our contract campaign and things we've done differently [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=544.6s)]
*  since we took over. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=548.72s)]
*  Our membership was energized and ready to do whatever they had to do to get the right [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  results. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=554.24s)]
*  It was just really a matter of the strategy and how we were going to exercise that and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=555.74s)]
*  just fully use the power of the membership. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=560.02s)]
*  And that's what gave us power at the bargaining table. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=561.9s)]
*  Obviously, United Auto Workers, Democratic Union, you're elected by them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=563.94s)]
*  You serve as their representative in these contract negotiations, not at the places that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=567.3s)]
*  aren't unionized. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=571.7s)]
*  But I'm curious to hear your reaction to this kind of sort of spillover effect that we've [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=572.7s)]
*  seen at non-union automakers raising their wages as well. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=577.74s)]
*  We call that the UAW bump. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=584.04s)]
*  That's what happens when we bargain good contracts. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=585.72s)]
*  Bargaining and organizing go hand in hand. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=588.64s)]
*  And you know, it's not a coincidence that within three days after us coming to tentative [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=591.04s)]
*  agreements at the big three, Toyota raised their wages by 11 percent and reduced their [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=595.08s)]
*  progression to four years. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=599.48s)]
*  Then Honda followed suit with bigger raises and a three-year progression. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  Then Hyundai jumped on board. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=605.64s)]
*  Now Volkswagen jumped on board. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=607.54s)]
*  And just today, Subaru announced wage increases for their employees because they want workers [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=608.96s)]
*  to fear having a union. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=613.12s)]
*  So they're trying to give them reasons not to join the union. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=616.02s)]
*  But we know the members, those workers, they deserve their fair share. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=620.1s)]
*  And that's going to be the next phase of this, is organizing those places and giving those [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=624.76s)]
*  workers their full share of the fruits of their labor. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=627.58s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get into that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=630.0600000000001s)]
*  But just to recap what you just said, those numbers that you just went through are very [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=631.5s)]
*  similar to the deal that you worked out, 11 percent pay increase immediately, a 25 percent [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=635.34s)]
*  pay increase over four and a half years, cost of living adjustments reinstated, shortened [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=641.6199999999999s)]
*  time to the top wage from eight years to three years. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  I know that's a big deal. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=648.28s)]
*  Right to strength over plant closures and ending the two-tier pay structure, which I [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=649.6999999999999s)]
*  know from conversations I've had was an enormous deal. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=652.92s)]
*  When you talk about looking to other places, let's talk about Tesla, which is the largest [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=656.14s)]
*  EV manufacturer in America and non-unionized. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=663.0799999999999s)]
*  And how important do you see that for the future of your union? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=665.56s)]
*  Well, I think one of the best and another thing we've done with this agreement, I mean, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=670.16s)]
*  when I took over, we were DOA when it came to the EV battery work. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=673.44s)]
*  We were in a bad position. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  And again, thanks to the power of the membership standing up, we were able to bargain some [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=679.04s)]
*  of that work under our master agreements, under our standards. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=684.12s)]
*  We approached the White House and Congress about this issue, and our taxpayer dollars [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=687.84s)]
*  are helping fund that transition. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=691.12s)]
*  So we expect to bring that standard up everywhere. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=693.12s)]
*  And the Elon Musk of the world that had the Teslas, they want to, that's how billionaires [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=695.64s)]
*  get their money. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=700.2s)]
*  They do it on the backs of the working-class people. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=701.2s)]
*  And they take the profits, and other people go poor in the process of these people getting [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=703.84s)]
*  rich so they can build rockets and fly themselves into outer space or whatever the hell it is [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=708.36s)]
*  they want to do with their spare time. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=712.84s)]
*  And workers are fed up in this country. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=714.24s)]
*  Our fight's not just for the UAW, our fight's for the entire working class. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=717.12s)]
*  And I think that's why 75% of Americans supported us in this fight. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=721.24s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk a little more about that sort of transition. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=725.36s)]
*  One thing, you talked about your contract, I think, is up May Day, 2028? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=729.68s)]
*  No, it's a four-year deal? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=735.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's been four and a half years, so yes. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=739.88s)]
*  And the idea that other unions negotiate similar contracts with similar dates, so a sort of [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=744.04s)]
*  additive power to the threat of strike. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you think the lesson has been from this year, not just for the United Auto Workers, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=755.0s)]
*  but we've seen it with the Writers Guild, we've seen it with SAG-AFTRA, we've seen it [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=759.32s)]
*  with flight attendants, we've seen it across the labor movement and across working people [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=762.76s)]
*  in this country, the most amount of strike activity we've seen in a generation. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=766.96s)]
*  You know, look, working-class people are fed up, union or not, and I think COVID taught [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=771.64s)]
*  us a valuable lesson. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=775.84s)]
*  People reflected on what's important in life, and what's important in life is not working [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  seven days a week, 12 and 16 hours a day, or working multiple jobs, scraping to get [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  by, living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  People want a life, and that's not a life. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=789.3199999999999s)]
*  And so I think that's what people are seeing now, is the pathway to having a better life [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  is by organizing and joining a union. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  And so I was very ecstatic we got May Day as an expiration date, and I look forward [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  to working with unions in this nation, but in this world to align our dates. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=806.0s)]
*  And that's one thing we learned in that process, is we have the power. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=809.0s)]
*  When we withhold our labor, no matter where people work, nothing moves. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=812.5s)]
*  The billionaire class, the corporate class can build all the factories or businesses [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=816.2800000000001s)]
*  they want, but if there aren't people there to do the work, nothing's going to move. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=820.08s)]
*  And so we have to harness that power, come together and organize and work together and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=823.4000000000001s)]
*  stand together, and we'll take our lives back. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=827.5200000000001s)]
*  Sean Fain, as president of that United Auto Workers Union, was just a very successful [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=831.08s)]
*  strike, the largest and longest in 22 years. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=835.6400000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=838.2800000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  Hey, thank you, Chris. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=840.2800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8PwZlLJUuw&t=860.2s)]
