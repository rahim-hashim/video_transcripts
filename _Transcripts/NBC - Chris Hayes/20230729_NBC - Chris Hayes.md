# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 28
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU)
*  So if you read through the new details of the special counsel's superseding indictment in the classified documents case [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=0.0s)]
*  So much of it sounds like something of a mob movie [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=5.94s)]
*  I recommend going straight to pages 28 and 29 for that after grand jury subpoenaed security camera footage from Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=9.48s)]
*  Including from the basement or Donald Trump stashed boxes of highly sensitive government documents [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=15.8s)]
*  Trump asked to meet with his loyal aide Walt Nata soon [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=20.68s)]
*  Nata was changing his travel plans to head to Mar-a-Lago where he met with another Trump employee Carlos de [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=24.0s)]
*  Olaviera de olaviera then goes into a closet with a fellow employee who works in IT where he told him that quote the boss [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=29.68s)]
*  Wanted the server for the security camera footage [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  Deleted when the other employee responds that he would not know how to do that totally fair [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=39.6s)]
*  De olaviera insisted that quote the boss wanted the server deleted and asked what are we going to do? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=44.24s)]
*  That sounds very mobby to me it calls to mind the kind of juicy cover-up details that led to the downfall of another president [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Richard Nixon you might remember that Nixon ultimately resigned after the smoking gun taper was released where he was heard discussing plans to cover up [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=57.92s)]
*  The break-in at the Watergate Hotel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  But at least Nixon had the good sense to try to insulate himself from the burglars who broke into the DNC headquarters [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=67.6s)]
*  He did not call them directly and ask them for status updates at least for more on this historical perspective [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  Let's turn to Douglas Brinkley is a professional [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=80.48s)]
*  historian a professor of history at Rice University and the author of numerous books including two on the Nixon tape [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=83.0s)]
*  So I just made a comparison there Doug, but I want to ask you you're the historian [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=89.6s)]
*  How would you compare Trump's alleged behavior in this supersighting indictment superseding indictment to Nixon and the Watergate scandal? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=93.72s)]
*  Donald Trump defines what a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=103.12s)]
*  Being you know a bad operator is Nixon had a patriotic side to him [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  He served in World War two. He did a lot of good things as president foreign affairs force the China trip in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=111.84s)]
*  1972 and and you know in something like look at Trump's very George Wallace like and Nixon was for affirmative action [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=118.92s)]
*  Nixon created the EPA. I don't want to rehabilitate Richard Nixon, but Nixon did the right thing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=127.16s)]
*  He resigned he recognized if he stayed and fought impeachment it would destroy the Republican Party for a generation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=132.72s)]
*  It would do damage to the United States. There's no sign that Nixon ever would have gone around willy-nilly showing people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=139.48s)]
*  You know top a security clearance documents like Donald Trump did contingency plans for for wars or anything like this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=146.76s)]
*  So Nixon's the only person I know that's coming out better because of these recent allegations this week [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=154.88s)]
*  But remember it wasn't just Nixon's tapes. It was the erasing of the tapes on Rosemary Woods [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Secretary erased 18 and a half minutes and we now saw Donald Trump trying to get do away with videotape [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=169.28s)]
*  Yes, take the tapes is the theme [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=176.24s)]
*  So, okay if Richard Nixon and Donald Trump not exact comparison because all the reasons you just outlined you have compared Trump or said [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=178.16s)]
*  He fits into the American narrative of some outlaw folk heroes like Al Capone [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=186.36s)]
*  Don Dillinger and Billy the kid lay that out for us [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=190.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Trump's really as a gangster. He saw he's like a mafioso [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=194.66s)]
*  And those are the people he grew up with Roy Cohen was his lawyer [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=199.94s)]
*  He would deal with him, you know 15 20 times a day in the 1980s. It was his hero [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=204.66s)]
*  These guys were shameless reckless [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=209.7s)]
*  You know, they there was no law they wouldn't try to circumvent. They always denied everything and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=212.62s)]
*  So trumps of that ilk and you know yet sometimes in America, wherever they're at Donald [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=218.78s)]
*  there's all the other presidents including Nixon and Donald Trump on his island by himself and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=223.3s)]
*  Trump really reflects this outlaw tradition America people sometimes like the guy with the middle finger telling everybody off [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  The rules don't apply to me [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  But that only lasts for so long and I think at last as Kamala Harris said the noose is tightening on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=237.74s)]
*  Donald Trump and it seems to me that every week he's getting closer to his ultimate comeuppance [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=244.5s)]
*  Now you've been watching Donald Trump for a long time. You've been following presidents for even longer [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=251.58s)]
*  What do you think could prompt him to step back or not? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  Continue to claim he did nothing wrong if anything. I [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=262.98s)]
*  Don't think anything. I think it's about eating up the clock [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=267.18s)]
*  running and winning and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=271.02s)]
*  If he wins, he feels all those problems will be erased [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=273.34s)]
*  Otherwise, he's gonna have to start asking for favors from whoever other Republicans are Rick DeSantis or somebody that's that's not going to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=276.9s)]
*  Happen so I've been feeling Donald Trump's in this to the bitter end even if he's in a jail cell [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  He will try to keep running because he'll never admit he lost [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  Nixon had won the biggest election landslide in 1972 [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=295.02s)]
*  He legitimately was a two-term president Donald Trump is a loser [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=298.86s)]
*  He he won one term and lost yet. He's willing to take the Republican Party in the country down with him [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=303.14s)]
*  So as we are all discussing this in the months ahead [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  We should maybe compare him less to Nixon as much as we often do [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=312.94s)]
*  Is there any moment in any other president's life career that you would compare the events of the last several years to or even? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=316.42s)]
*  Well, I think Nixon had the silent majority right and what Donald Trump has the maga-mega phone they're not silent anymore [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=325.14s)]
*  But it's by and large. It's a very large hunk of the country [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=332.58s)]
*  Trump very astutely connected the anti NAFTA Ross Perot vote of 1992 with the George Wallace [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  Segregationist vote with some of the Richard Nixon law and order with advice from Roy [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=343.62s)]
*  Cohen you can do a composite portrait of Donald Trump, but in the end he is a weird one offer [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=348.38s)]
*  He's somebody whose ego is so large that it's hard to you know, but put it in anything [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  But you know terms of a psychiatrist and you really have to look abroad at dictators [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=359.78s)]
*  To compare Trump to authoritarian figures perhaps characters like you along in American history [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=365.9s)]
*  Joe McCarthy, but alas you along and Joe McCarthy never were in the White House and Donald Trump was I [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=371.9s)]
*  Want to end on a positive note here because it is a Friday evening at the end of a long week [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  We often say that our democracy is under threat and at risk and it's important to remind people of that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=383.38s)]
*  But are there moments in history that we should look to as moments where democracy was challenged in our country and we overcame it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=388.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, certainly I mean I always tell students to remember the point of history as our own times aren't uniquely oppressive [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=396.74s)]
*  Anybody who studies something like the Civil War even though it went on in our country during the Vietnam era on [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  58,000 servicemen dead while we were mired in Southeast Asia [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=410.38s)]
*  We've seen it worse, but there is a feeling that our institutions are dissolving [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=413.58s)]
*  Washington DC is as most [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=419.62s)]
*  dysfunctional as it's really been since the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=422.18s)]
*  1850s [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=424.98s)]
*  Period and that's frightening. But you know, we everybody talks about Trump a lot [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  He eats up a lot of oxygen, but we may be living in the age of Joe Biden [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=430.14s)]
*  Imagine if Biden beats Donald Trump is a two-term president somebody who warded off Trumpism [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=433.61999999999995s)]
*  We'll be looking at Biden's record very different if he if he indeed is a two-term er [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=440.02s)]
*  So lately as I have been watching the way Florida governor Ron DeSantis is running his presidential campaign [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  There is a question that has been running through my mind [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=453.29999999999995s)]
*  Are you okay governor? I mean for real. Are you good? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=456.9s)]
*  It's okay if you don't actually want to run for president it's completely okay [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=460.38s)]
*  It's difficult really to take away any other conclusion when you look at the events of the last few weeks from the Florida governor's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=465.14000000000004s)]
*  Increasingly bizarre campaign for the White House take his recent fundraising report [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=472.3s)]
*  It turns out until recently at least he was burning through money like a teen pop star with a new record deal for anyone [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=476.86s)]
*  Who doesn't follow that it's quite quickly [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=483.22s)]
*  But this whole spending issue was apparently news to Ron DeSantis [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=485.38000000000005s)]
*  This detail so from some of the reporting earlier this week really stuck out to me [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=489.22s)]
*  Quote that the campaigns had not hit expected fundraising targets and spent exorbitantly caught the candidate and his wife by surprise a [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=493.14000000000004s)]
*  Person with knowledge of the reaction set now [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  Here's the thing DeSantis and of what his wife have been crisscrossing the country on a private plane [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=503.5s)]
*  Private jets spending worth in a million dollars on air travel [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=508.94000000000005s)]
*  I mean did they walk onto that plane and think those jets were free or something? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=511.94s)]
*  Don't they know free private jet rides are only available to conservative Supreme Court justices with rich benefactors [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=516.02s)]
*  Sorry, I couldn't help myself on that one and it is not just the fundraising either [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=521.9s)]
*  It's it's hard to imagine that DeSantis is defensive some policy [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=525.74s)]
*  It's had the goal of actually winning votes in mind this week [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=530.26s)]
*  He defended a decision by the Florida Department of Education to include language in the state curriculum [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=533.62s)]
*  Effectively defending slavery and touting the supposed benefits of it to people who were enslaved [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=539.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean it was so beyond the pale even the standards of conservative culture wars [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=545.38s)]
*  Didn't buy it didn't buy into it [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=551.38s)]
*  It sparked one of the first attacks this primary cycle from the friendly and mild-mannered [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=553.34s)]
*  Republican candidate senator Tim Scott of South Carolina who criticized the governor's comments by pointing out [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=558.72s)]
*  There is no silver lining in slavery back check that one's very very true by Senator Tim Scott [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  Side note this one's for you Tim Scott. We know you have it in you now. We know you are not just nice [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=570.4599999999999s)]
*  Don't stop with DeSantis some free political advice for you Google Trump crimes mob. It's gonna blow your mind [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=576.5799999999999s)]
*  And I might give you some ideas. We'll see we'll see what you do over the next few weeks now this week [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=583.78s)]
*  DeSantis also somehow managed to hit the double whammy angering two different political constituencies at the same time [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sKBlkm8WvU&t=588.7800000000001s)]
