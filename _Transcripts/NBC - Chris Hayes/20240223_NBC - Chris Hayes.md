# ‘Chaos and confusion’ Inside the civil war engulfing the Michigan GOP
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ)
*  Around the country in key battleground states, the Republican Party is on the verge of imploding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans' unfettered loyalty to Donald Trump has led to disintegration and rot within [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=5.92s)]
*  local leadership, which is now playing out in some very wild battles for control. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=10.44s)]
*  The most dramatic of these is happening in Michigan, where Trump loyalist and election [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=15.96s)]
*  denier Christina Caramo was recently ousted as chair of the state party and replaced by [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=20.32s)]
*  former Ambassador Pete Hoekstra. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=27.28s)]
*  True to her election-denying self, Caramo is refusing to step down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=29.6s)]
*  She retains control of the party's bank accounts, which are reportedly near empty, as well as [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=34.0s)]
*  their social media and email. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=39.36s)]
*  And she's planning to hold her own duly-nominated convention next week. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=41.6s)]
*  So it is all chaos and confusion in what could be a bellwether state for Republicans this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=46.2s)]
*  year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=50.8s)]
*  Joining me now is Sala Nuzis, former chair of that Michigan Republican Party and a good [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=51.8s)]
*  friend, Saul Welcome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  I want to start with this AP report that talks about the Michigan GOP and how they got into [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=57.72s)]
*  this fundraising crisis. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  AP reports that the Michigan Republican Party was deep in debt when a longtime party donor [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=65.32s)]
*  who had given more than a million dollars over the past decade asked for a meeting with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=71.08s)]
*  Camaro Caramo. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=76.0s)]
*  She turned him down because he was, shall I say it, a rhino. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=77.69999999999999s)]
*  So you have a million dollar donor who says, hey, I want to help the party, chairman. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  And she's like, well, I'm sorry, your money and go for me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=89.72s)]
*  What's going on in Michigan? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  No, I think that's part of the problem. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  She ran kind of a populist campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Ironically, one of the other people considering running was the co-chair of the party, who [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  was a very staunch Trump supporter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  But Camaro said she wasn't Trump enough. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=105.44s)]
*  And so they wanted even more loyalists out there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=109.0s)]
*  And so they said they weren't going to talk to the major donors. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=111.64s)]
*  They wanted the grassroots to raise money. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=115.04s)]
*  And as all of us know, that's just physically impossible. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  That's not the way you do things. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=119.64s)]
*  And so they turned down the state party building. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=121.2s)]
*  They couldn't afford to even pay for the expenses to keep the party open. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  And so now they are basically bankrupt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=128.32s)]
*  I don't think they have, if there's any money in the bank, it's very limited. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=130.04s)]
*  And there's no money to run any programs. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=134.28s)]
*  There's no money to assist candidates in running elections. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=136.36s)]
*  These conventions are going to cost money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=139.72s)]
*  They also are going to have problems there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=141.08s)]
*  So I think that the party basically elected Ambassador Hoekstra, who I think will do a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=143.12s)]
*  very good job. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=148.52s)]
*  I think he's got a relationship with folks. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=149.52s)]
*  Yeah, very supportive of him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=150.52s)]
*  But I don't know if we should say that because it might get him in trouble. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=151.52s)]
*  But then you raise an interesting point about the convention, because the reality of it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=155.36s)]
*  is you've got these two competing conventions coming up next week, where the state party, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=158.96s)]
*  the official party now recognized by the RNC and presumably by the courts next week, and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=165.12s)]
*  Karamo's effort are going to be happening at the same time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  You were, in my estimation, the last very successful chairman of that party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  You raised in a very short period of time a lot of money in presidential cycles. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=179.92s)]
*  When you're looking at these two conventions coming up, you're looking at the party that's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  broken, and you look at the fact that Michigan is still a key player in who the next president [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=190.0s)]
*  of the United States is going to be. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=194.48s)]
*  What's your estimation? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=196.48s)]
*  What would you say to the party activists and loyalists right now? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=197.48s)]
*  Well, look, I think the party is going to have to pull together. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=199.92s)]
*  This is not going to be an easy task. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  There are very passionate people on both sides of the issue here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=205.16s)]
*  But there's great opportunities in Michigan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=208.76s)]
*  We've got a United States Senate seat up, and we've got some very good candidates that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=210.44s)]
*  are vying for the Republican nomination. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=213.76s)]
*  You have a presidential race that is very close with a very upset Arab-American community [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  in Michigan, which makes up a large number of voters in Michigan that have traditionally [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  voted Democrat. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of factors that are coming together that could make this a very good [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=224.56s)]
*  year for Republicans in Michigan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  So they can lean into that fact that the Arab community there, which is one of the largest [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  in the country, is very upset with the Biden administration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=233.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  And look, if you take a look at what's happened around the country, I mean, we've got Governor [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  Kemp in Georgia. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  We have other people who actually ran outside and around the parties. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=241.56s)]
*  In the age of super PACs and C4s, et cetera, you don't necessarily need the party. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=245.28s)]
*  It's helpful. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  There are things a party can do that other groups can't do. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  But the reality is, I think you're finding, as these parties go off on the fringe, as [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=254.16s)]
*  these parties go into debt, as these parties basically try to do, you know, everyone who [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=257.8s)]
*  doesn't agree with them is a rhino, you know, elections are about addition, not subtraction [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=264.2s)]
*  in this game. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we need every Republican to pull together if they're going to win an election. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, these people are trying to exclude certain people and make it very [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=275.74s)]
*  difficult to win elections. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=278.78s)]
*  And that's going to be the challenge. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=279.78s)]
*  Before we—because I do want to talk to you about national popular vote, which is something [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=281.08s)]
*  you and I work very closely on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=283.94s)]
*  Do you see this as a little bit of a bellwether, what's happening in Michigan, also playing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=286.66s)]
*  out in other states, potentially like Arizona, where, again, the state party chairmen step [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=290.38s)]
*  down and you've got other types of, you know, issues? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=294.3s)]
*  Even in my home state of Maryland, we've got some issues. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=297.14s)]
*  Look, you've got the national party that's virtually bankrupt, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=298.86s)]
*  They don't have any money. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=301.58s)]
*  They're not raising money. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=302.58s)]
*  They have not been very successful in that regard. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=303.58s)]
*  You have at least three state parties, if not four, that are on the verge of bankruptcy [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=305.62s)]
*  if not having very serious financial problems. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=309.74s)]
*  This is probably the worst scenario I've seen in my lifetime with regards to what the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=312.5s)]
*  state parties look like right now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=317.1s)]
*  So I think there's some real challenges. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=318.5s)]
*  And as is always the case, it's going to be a function of a candidate stepping forward, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=320.86s)]
*  right? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=325.46s)]
*  And I think that's where you see the post-Trump era already being discussed by so many people, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=326.46s)]
*  like who are going to be the next candidates? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=330.94s)]
*  I mean, we'll probably have 15 to 20 people running. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=332.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=335.46s)]
*  It's similar to what we had in 2016. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=336.46s)]
*  So, you know, you've got a whole different scenario coming around in that regard. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=337.46s)]
*  So how does the work that you're doing now in the national popular vote, which is about [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=340.22s)]
*  needs about what, 70? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=345.3s)]
*  65 now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=347.62s)]
*  65 votes in the electoral college to come into law. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=348.62s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that very quickly and how the states can benefit from something [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=351.86s)]
*  like the national popular vote. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=357.26000000000005s)]
*  So the national popular vote, there's two different proposals. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=358.26000000000005s)]
*  One's a constitutional amendment to eliminate the electoral college, which is not what we [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=359.82000000000005s)]
*  support. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  We basically are supporting a process that's called an interstate compact, which is an [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  agreement between the states to basically say when enough states join this compact that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=368.1s)]
*  have 270 electoral votes or more, they're going to vote as a block. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=371.98s)]
*  And that by definition will guarantee the presidency to whatever candidate wins the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=375.82s)]
*  most votes in a presidential election nationwide in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=380.42s)]
*  So it is a very realistic proposal that's passed 16 states plus the District of Columbia. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=385.08s)]
*  We are the most likely reform that I think would have a very large impact on how presidential [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=390.3s)]
*  candidates are run. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=394.5s)]
*  Look, four out of five Americans live in a state that is either decidedly Republican [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=395.7s)]
*  or decidedly Democrat. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=399.26s)]
*  And it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democratic candidate, you ignore those [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=400.26s)]
*  40, 42 states in every presidential election. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=403.58s)]
*  You know, we elect over 500,000 elected officials in this country, all of whom are elected by [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=406.26s)]
*  whoever gets the most votes, but one. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=410.5s)]
*  And one represents the country as a whole. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=412.62s)]
*  So I think this is a reform that would be very healthy for the country. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=414.22s)]
*  It preserves the electoral college and makes sure states continue to administer those elections. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=417.62s)]
*  And it strengthens the electoral college by making sure that all 50 states are participating, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=421.74s)]
*  all 50 states matter, and campaigns will be forced into all 50 states. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=425.5s)]
*  So I think it's a good thing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=428.97999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=429.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, I definitely want to get you back to talk. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=430.97999999999996s)]
*  I know Chris, this is an issue I think Chris Hayes would really kind of sink his teeth [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=432.9s)]
*  into. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=436.53999999999996s)]
*  So I'm going to put the bug in, Nazir, to get you back on. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  Solid News. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=439.7s)]
*  Thank you so much, my friend, for being with us. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=440.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YSqH0eKKpQ&t=455.46s)]
