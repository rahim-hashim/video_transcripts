Video Description: Trump defenders are trying to spin Trump’s tariffs as an attempt to bring the middle-class economy back to the heyday of the 1960s. But Trump himself keeps saying his plan will return America back to the 1890s. “Don't think GM—think Triangle Shirtwaist Factory,” says Hayes.

# 'Idiotic': Trump's tariffs aim to send us back to Triangle Shirtwaist Factory era
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, here we are now on day 78 of the second Donald Trump presidency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And we are on the precipice of a trade war that has no precedent in modern history [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=6.44s)]
*  Trump's saying that starting tonight at midnight [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  the US will tax imports from China at a rate of a hundred and four percent an [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=14.64s)]
*  Announcement that sent stock markets back into freefall as everyone contemplates the world's two biggest trading partners bringing global commerce to a halt [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And basically every economist across the spectrum with maybe a few exceptions thinks this is a disaster [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=29.4s)]
*  The conservative opinion writers of the Wall Street Journal who helped elect Donald Trump twice are absolutely [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=35.64s)]
*  Freaking the F out that Donald Trump is killing free trade in the American economy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=41.56s)]
*  Even Trump's unelected co-president Elon Musk is reportedly pleading with Trump in private to reverse course on the tariffs [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=47.04s)]
*  Well publicly he's fighting online with Peter Navarro Trump's top trade advisor and the architect of Trump's tariff plans [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=54.46s)]
*  Musk called him a moron. He called him dumber than a sack of bricks and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  worse [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=67.82s)]
*  Mid all this there has been this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=69.22s)]
*  desperate almost kind of pathological search for some sort of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=72.14s)]
*  Reason at the core of Trump's policy here, and so you're seeing the MAGA faithful spin this in the media [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=76.7s)]
*  They've created and not just them. I think some of the mainstream media as well [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=82.74s)]
*  They've created this kind of alternate steel man version of one Trump is doing where what he's trying to do is recreate [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  The middle-class economy of the post-world war two boom years that many people have genuine nostalgia for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  Because it was the best time for certain folks [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=99.86s)]
*  I mean particularly white folks without college degrees to enter the middle class you had a strong [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=102.38s)]
*  Growing industrial manufacturing base met those folks could get union jobs paid a good wage had benefits in health care [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=108.08s)]
*  Send their kids to college you had a huge home production right and a 30-year mortgage [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=114.72s)]
*  You could buy a home cheaply and again. There's a reason that people across the political spectrum [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=119.36s)]
*  I mean liberals conservatives everyone between [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=125.28s)]
*  Tend to harken back to the days of high union density density low inequality a growing middle class [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=127.96s)]
*  It really was good for a lot of people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=135.02s)]
*  So again the charitable argument and you're seeing this everywhere once you we hear this you'll see it for what Trump wants here [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=137.94s)]
*  The reason that he's started a global trade war that may very well impoverish the whole world and the US [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=145.22s)]
*  Then what he wants to do is go back to the heyday of the 1960s the wonder years opening credits, and who doesn't want that? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=150.46s)]
*  But here's the thing and I cannot stress this strongly enough [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=158.86s)]
*  That is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely not what he is doing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=163.5s)]
*  It's complete wish casting because he keeps telling us what his actual goals are here [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=165.3s)]
*  The country was at the richest point in its history in the 1890s [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=172.46s)]
*  It was all tariffs if you looked at William McKinley as an example [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  He was a big terror president in the words of a very great but highly underrated president William McKinley [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  I am a tariff man standing on a tariff platform if you look at some of McKinley's words [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=187.62s)]
*  He was very beautiful from [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=193.86s)]
*  1789 to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  1913 we were a tariff-backed nation and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been then in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  1913 for reasons unknown to mankind [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=207.02s)]
*  They established the income tax so that citizens rather than foreign countries would start paying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=210.06s)]
*  The money necessary to run our government the foreign countries don't pay the tariffs [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=215.54s)]
*  But that aside as you can see from that nice montage we put together it's not about the 1950s [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=222.98s)]
*  It's not about the 1960s. It's not boomer nostalgia. It's not the wonder years [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=229.18s)]
*  It is quite explicitly about taking us back to the 1890s to pre 1913 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=233.18s)]
*  To William McKinley he said it on the campaign trail over and over and over again [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=239.78s)]
*  He said it on the day. He announced the terrorist to the world. He is also very clear and consistent about why [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=245.66s)]
*  the president of the United States and again, he said this many times just [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=254.26s)]
*  Hopes this six trillion dollar tax hike. He is unilaterally slapping on you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=258.78s)]
*  Via all imports the US [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=265.26s)]
*  Most of which will be paid by working middle-class and poor folks will raise revenue [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  He can then use to hand over to the billionaires by either massively cutting income taxes or getting rid of them altogether [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  It is a plan economists call unrealistic [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=281.34s)]
*  Unattainable bad math. It would be wildly regressive [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=284.78s)]
*  But even if the math could work think about it again [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=288.58s)]
*  The period he thinks is the golden error the heyday he's returning to is the Gilded Age and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=291.82s)]
*  tariffs for the way to get there and part of the reason it is such a just [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=297.06s)]
*  idiotic destructive insane idea and no one could really actually upset [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=301.18s)]
*  That's what he wants. Even though that's what he's telling us. It's like the opposite of mourning in America, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=306.5s)]
*  Shining city on a hill in America the future [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=311.5s)]
*  You don't know what that era was about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  Rampant tuberculosis and tenement slums [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  Non-existent public services poor sewage heavy industrial pollution robber barons lording their insane wealth over everyone [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=319.42s)]
*  No one but like billionaires could possibly want that. I mean they did build a bunch of nice houses in Newport, Rhode Island, but [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=327.1s)]
*  And what about those manufacturing jobs, right? Isn't all worth it if it brings heavy industries back United States [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  Maybe to factory hours possibly for workers again [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=340.82s)]
*  We're not talking about high-paying unionized assembly line jobs of the 1950s 60s here. So don't think GM think [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=345.02s)]
*  Triangle shirtwares factory of the early 1900s or you know, the 21st century version [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  I guess as described by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=361.82s)]
*  Trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America. That's huge GDP [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=365.66s)]
*  The factories being built in America are huge that takes years and you said that robots are gonna fill those jobs [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=369.97999999999996s)]
*  So those aren't you know, it's really automated jobs. It's automated factories [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=377.06s)]
*  Automated factories, but the key is who's gonna build the factories who's gonna operate the factories? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=382.62s)]
*  Who's gonna make them work great American workers the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little little screws to make [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=387.7s)]
*  iPhones that kind of thing is gonna come to America [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=395.74s)]
*  It's gonna be automated and great Americans the trade craft of America is going to fix them is gonna work on them [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=398.7s)]
*  Bro, what are you talking about? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=406.46s)]
*  That's the vision. That's a vision. It's honestly too self-contradictory to call it a vision [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  the screwing of the little screws will [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=415.14s)]
*  Be in America millions of people doing it but it will be automated and then the great American workers will be proudly fixing the robots [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=418.26s)]
*  That do the screwing who's getting screwed? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=423.74s)]
*  If you err on the side of taking it all seriously which again it takes an effort [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=426.42s)]
*  But believing that Trump wants to see this through and cause a global global trade war and send us back to the 1890s [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=430.02s)]
*  Which I think is where we're at. The only thing that could stop it right now is probably Congress and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=436.66s)]
*  What's surprising is it looks like it might be starting to move a little bit in that direction [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=442.98s)]
*  Today senators from both parties got to grill Trump's trade representative and Republicans did not want to stop it [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=448.66s)]
*  Republicans did not hold back [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=455.62s)]
*  Who pays these high tariffs in the short medium term? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=458.26s)]
*  It will be the consumer. It'll be the consumer and so I'm worried about the inflationary effect [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=461.86s)]
*  I'm worried if there is a trade war that we're gonna have markets shutting down for American farmers [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=467.3s)]
*  I don't often agree with the members on the other side of the aisle [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=473.7s)]
*  But in many cases here today, particularly when they're expressing concern about small businesses in their states [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=477.46s)]
*  I'm hoping you're very and I hope you and the president very sensitive about [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=483.1s)]
*  Companies potentially going bankrupt by these actions whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=488.26s)]
*  At last center there that's Tom Tillis in North Carolina, he's up for reelection in a swing state [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=495.46s)]
*  He's also one of seven Republican senators [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=499.9s)]
*  We're now backing a bipartisan bill that would require Congress to approve President Trump's tariffs on trading partners under that bill sponsored by Republican [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=502.02s)]
*  Senator Chuck Grassley, if I want Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington any tariffs imposed by the president would expire after 60 days [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=511.3s)]
*  Unless Congress voted to approve them [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=518.54s)]
*  You [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMz4Zlst0BQ&t=540.74s)]
