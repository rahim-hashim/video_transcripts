Video Description: New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie discusses the major problems with a potential third party candidate in 2024: “Given the electoral college, given the fact that you need to structure elections over the entire country especially for a presidential election, there’s no real way for a third party to win.”

# ‘Manchin is dreaming’ after speech at third-party town hall with no donor disclosure says columnist
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA)
*  Basically, if people make you believe you're divided, don't accept that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=0.0s)]
*  You're not divided. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  You wouldn't be sitting here if you were divided. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's the politics in Washington, the business of the Democrat and Republican Party that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=8.3s)]
*  has a better model. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=12.38s)]
*  Their business model is better if you're divided, and basically they get you all chained up [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=14.14s)]
*  and you're ready to go, and nothing gets done. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=19.46s)]
*  So their business model is better to be divided than united. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=21.86s)]
*  And we're going to change that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=25.42s)]
*  That was America's self-described unifier, Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=27.62s)]
*  at a town hall in New Hampshire sponsored by No Labels, an organization that is trying [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=32.68s)]
*  to sell itself as nonpartisan, though there are big, huge, gave-in questions about who [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=37.68s)]
*  is backing the group, since they refuse to disclose their donors, and huge holes in their [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=42.88s)]
*  argument that running a third-party ticket wouldn't just elect Donald Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=47.24s)]
*  So maybe unity and an end to all division sounds great on paper. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  I mean, more options. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=56.02s)]
*  Tone down the partisanship. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=57.42s)]
*  Can't we all just get along? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=59.14s)]
*  It sounds good. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=60.42s)]
*  But as Jamal Bowie argues in the New York Times, this whole notion is a bit of a fantasy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=61.7s)]
*  He writes, quote, there's no way to realize this long-running fantasy of politics without [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=66.8s)]
*  partisanship. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=71.5s)]
*  Organized conflict is an unavoidable part of democratically structured political life [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=73.1s)]
*  for the simple reason that politics is about governing and governing is about choices. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=77.38s)]
*  Opinion columnist for the New York Times joins me now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=83.4s)]
*  Now, you started your column with this line that really stuck with me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=86.12s)]
*  For as long as Americans have had partisan political competition, they have hated partisanship [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=89.8s)]
*  itself. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=94.28s)]
*  Or, I'm going to add my—or so they say. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=95.28s)]
*  But you make the case for the effectiveness of partisanship. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=97.92s)]
*  So let's hear it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  What's the case? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=102.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=103.2s)]
*  I mean, it's not so much that partisanship is effective or ineffective. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=104.2s)]
*  It's just part of life. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=108.84s)]
*  It's an unavoidable part of political life, like I wrote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  And so the question really isn't, can we have politics without partisanship? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=113.86s)]
*  And the clear answer is no. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  Even during times when partisanship is relatively low, there was still intense partisan competition. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  It comes with the package. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=126.58s)]
*  The question is, does our political system work with the partisanship we have? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=128.22s)]
*  Does it facilitate it? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=132.78s)]
*  Does it structure it in a useful way? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=134.42s)]
*  Or does our political system make it difficult to operate under conditions of high levels [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=136.82s)]
*  of partisanship? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=140.76s)]
*  Now, I would say that the issue is the latter in that if you want a better politics, you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=141.76s)]
*  actually just need to change the system in which we're working. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=146.84s)]
*  Now, so one of the arguments of changing the system are these candidates who are running [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  for potentially for no labels or in a third party. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=155.16s)]
*  And national polling has captured the appetite for a third party or unity ticket for decades. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=158.44s)]
*  I mean, back in 2016, it was 46 percent said we needed a third party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=162.82s)]
*  A poll last week said 47 percent. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=168.14s)]
*  It's been around for a while. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=170.14s)]
*  But in actual elections with a third party or unity candidate, it typically turns into [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=171.74s)]
*  single digit support. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=176.78s)]
*  Maybe that validates what you're saying in your column. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=179.34s)]
*  But why do you think that is? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  I think it's because typically these third party candidacies aren't really challenging [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=184.34s)]
*  or changing the system at all. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=188.56s)]
*  First of all, it's not clear that voters want some sort of like amorphous unity ticket. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=190.48s)]
*  When voters talk about wanting a third option, they often mean they want something distinct. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  And the thing about a unity ticket is by definition, it isn't distinct. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  But the other thing is that there's no real way to win, given the electoral college, given [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=205.82s)]
*  the fact that you need to kind of structure elections over the over the entire country, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  especially for presidential election. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  There's no real way for a third party to win. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  And really, the only time a third party has actually won or come close to winning in American [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=222.68s)]
*  history is when the other parties collapse. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  The Republican Party emerges out of the collapse of the Whig Party. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  And so it's like the system briefly becomes no longer a two party system and then becomes [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  a two party system again. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=240.36s)]
*  And so you have to actually change kind of the underlying rules of the game to even make [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  a third party viable in any kind of election. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=245.72s)]
*  And then the third parties that are likely going to emerge are going to stand for something [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=248.62s)]
*  specific. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=252.5s)]
*  They're not just going to be a kumbaya party of all sides coming together. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=253.5s)]
*  You make this point also in your column that there's a tendency for those who are advocating [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=258.42s)]
*  for a unity ticket or unifying to kind of lump very different things together. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=262.76s)]
*  And this really stuck out to me, too, like Black Lives Matter and the January 6th right. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=266.82s)]
*  Not that they're saying it exactly like that, but they are lumping them together, which [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=271.3s)]
*  clearly feels dangerous. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=275.26s)]
*  Why do you think that that is part of the argument? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=277.74s)]
*  Or do you think that they're just they don't think of it that way? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=280.6s)]
*  I mean, my sense is that they think of it as they're positing the two extremes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=285.48s)]
*  And Senator Manchin in during the town hall, this is the terms in which he talks about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=289.56s)]
*  it, that there are these two extreme sides. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=293.12s)]
*  And I mean, those extremes aren't equivalent at all. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=296.36s)]
*  But I think that's how the people making the argument imagine it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  And I guess what I would say is that, again, there's actually nothing really wrong with [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=303.1s)]
*  people having extreme views. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=307.72s)]
*  There's nothing necessarily wrong with people having views that are outside of the mainstream. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=310.74s)]
*  The question is, like, to what extent we want those views to be represented in our politics. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=315.86s)]
*  And if we want them represented at all, and I think it's an open question, some people [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=320.38000000000005s)]
*  do, some people don't, then you have to actually look at the structure of how you you create [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=324.42s)]
*  political competition in the country right now because of our multi because of our single [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=329.58000000000004s)]
*  member districts, because of our first past the post elections, everything set up to create [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=334.32s)]
*  two dominant parties. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  But it doesn't have to be that way. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's really I think for people who want another option, that's how they should be [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=343.8s)]
*  thinking. Not can we create a third party presidential campaign? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=347.88s)]
*  But what are the rules of the game and how do you change them to facilitate competition? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RON52Wd2NBA&t=351.52s)]
