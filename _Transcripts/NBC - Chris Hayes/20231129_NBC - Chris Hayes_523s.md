# 'Best shot' Big money donors bet on Nikki Haley to take down Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We're under 50 days from the Iowa [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=0.0s)]
*  caucus where Republican primary voters will have their first shot to choose a [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=3.44s)]
*  presidential nominee. And the last time that most of the country went to the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=7.24s)]
*  pool polls with big sort of national election, the 2022 midterm elections a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=11.0s)]
*  little over a year ago. And as you might remember, Republicans delivered a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=15.44s)]
*  pretty shocking underperformance in those elections, and it was an [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=18.98s)]
*  underperformance that was particularly pronounced among the Trump aligned [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=23.0s)]
*  We saw this early in that election night, and it just kept going. The Curry [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=27.16s)]
*  Lake in Arizona and the Herschel Walkers in Georgia and the TV Dr. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=30.72s)]
*  Mehmet Aziz in Pennsylvania. In short, MAGA lost big in 2022. And as a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=34.72s)]
*  result, at the time, there was a real feeling that people understood that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=41.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's political potency had waned, that he was an albatross, and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=44.84s)]
*  ergo would be a good idea to get someone new as a Republican standard [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  bearer in this election contest. And we might be in for a competitive Republican [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=52.56s)]
*  presidential primary in 2023 into 24. And that is why you saw so many [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=57.32s)]
*  candidates decide to run against Donald Trump earlier this year. Of course, now [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=62.32s)]
*  with the benefit of finding tonight, things have not really turned out that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=67.72s)]
*  way. The base still loves Trump, wants him to be the party's nominee. Florida [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis, who was, of course, widely seen as the most viable [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=75.88s)]
*  alternative to Trump, has delivered one of the worst campaign performances of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  all time, truly one of the most stunning cash burning operations in recent [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=83.84s)]
*  American politics. At the start of this year, DeSantis was at least feasibly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  competitive with Trump in the polls. Look at that. That's a real race. By the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  time he announced in late May, much later than many observers thought he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=97.04s)]
*  should, Trump had opened up about a 30 point lead in the polling averages. And [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=100.72s)]
*  then in that time, the DeSantis campaign, the affiliated PACs, has spent [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=105.6s)]
*  nearly $50 million on advertising, only to see his numbers sink even lower to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=109.24s)]
*  near single digits while Trump's lead widened to about 45 points. You're going [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=114.16s)]
*  in the wrong direction, Ron. I think it's fair to say that this is not where [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=118.88s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wanted to end up. I think it has dawned on the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  non-Trump loving parts of the Republican Party. And there are those elements. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=129.24s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in a sec. That there is one last chance, 50 days [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=133.72s)]
*  out from Iowa, one last chance for competitive primary, barring some huge [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  unforeseen circumstances. Given the table as it is set right now, one last [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=141.84s)]
*  chance to have it out over the future of what the party, the Republican Party, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=146.88s)]
*  and whether it is going to fully align itself behind the man who wants to end [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=150.8s)]
*  American democracy, or whether the Republican Party is going to continue to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=154.68s)]
*  be a party that's woven into the fabric of the Constitutional Republic. That's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=158.12s)]
*  the choice for the party. And the way to make that happen would be a one on one [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=162.64s)]
*  contest between Trump's and former South Carolina Governor and UN Ambassador [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=167.48s)]
*  Nikki Haley. Anything other than complete consolidation of the non-Trump [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=171.55999999999997s)]
*  forces in the race are only going to help Trump by splitting the vote. I [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=175.6s)]
*  suspect that is at least partly why we've seen former Vice President Mike [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=179.48s)]
*  Pence and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott suspend their campaigns fairly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  abruptly, actually. Maybe other Republicans in the race not named Nikki [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=187.27999999999997s)]
*  Haley will take their lead. Now, it's clearly not a majority view of primary [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=191.48s)]
*  voting Republicans. But there is definitely a contingent of the Republican [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=197.56s)]
*  Party that would like to, if they could, they'd like to move on from Trump. And [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=203.16s)]
*  these folks are just not particularly well represented anymore. I mean, the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=209.44s)]
*  conservative media is basically fully in the tank for MAGA. Most of the so-called [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  never Trump Republicans have essentially become parts of the Democratic Party [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=217.04s)]
*  coalition, especially in the Biden era. So there really is like no one out there [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=220.76s)]
*  in the world who speaks for this group of people. But they really do exist. I [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=224.88s)]
*  mean, there really are literally millions of them. They show up in polling. I mean, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=228.76s)]
*  around 20% of the Republican Party disapproves of Donald Trump. And for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=233.2s)]
*  these people who don't like the Democrats, they're not Democrats, they're [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=239.68s)]
*  conservatives, but who also don't like Trump, Nikki Haley appears to be their [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=243.12s)]
*  best shot. In fact, we've seen a succession of headlines in just the last few days [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=247.32s)]
*  that demonstrate that dawning realization. Haley's affiliated super PAC [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=251.56s)]
*  spent almost $9 million on advertising this month. That's a lot. It's nearly as [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=255.56s)]
*  much as both Trump and DeSantis's PACs combined. You've got Jamie Dimon, the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=259.48s)]
*  billionaire CEO of JP Morgan Chase, who's been talking up Haley to anyone who [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=264.6s)]
*  will listen, including during an event earlier today. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=268.4s)]
*  I did come out and make a nice statement about Nikki Haley. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=272.44s)]
*  You did. You've been talking to Nikki Haley. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=275.12s)]
*  Yes, I have. You're a very liberal Democrat. I urge you, you know, help Nikki [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=276.88s)]
*  Haley, too. You know, get a choice on the Republican side that might be better [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=281.24s)]
*  than Trump. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=285.12s)]
*  Also this week, it was reported that Americans for Prosperity, the infamous [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=286.44s)]
*  political arm of the Koch network, would be backing Haley as well, which is a huge [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=290.12s)]
*  development, providing her access to a near endless stream of dark money. Now, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=294.48s)]
*  the Koch political network run by Charles Koch, one of the richest men on [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=298.56s)]
*  Earth, has had obviously a relentlessly and profoundly malignant influence on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=301.52s)]
*  American life. In many ways, its unlimited supply of near untraceable money [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=306.84s)]
*  backing political movements like the Tea Party and then candidates paved the way [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  for Donald Trump brought us to the moment that we're in. And also just to be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  absolutely clear, I really don't like at all Nikki Haley's politics. I think it [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  would be a bad thing for the country if she were elected president. She would [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  pursue an agenda that negatively impacts the material conditions for working [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  Americans nearly every way from the climate to tax cuts to abortion rights. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=328.96s)]
*  But and also, I don't think Nikki Haley would prove to be an existential threat [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=333.4s)]
*  to the very framework of our representative democracy like Donald Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=339.4s)]
*  clearly would be and is. Listen to her at the first primary debate dressing down [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  candidate Vivek Ramaswamy over Ukraine. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=348.35999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine is a front line of defense. Putin has said if Russia once Russia takes [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=351.84s)]
*  Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. That's a world war. We're trying to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=358.2s)]
*  prevent war. Look at what Putin did today. He killed per goes in. When I was [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=362.28s)]
*  at the U.N., the Russian ambassador suddenly died. This guy is a murderer and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=367.08s)]
*  you are choosing a murderer over over a pro American country. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=372.52s)]
*  Now, that doesn't sound absolutely crazy. It's sort of, I don't know, like [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=378.12s)]
*  normal American foreign policy view with some that even Democrats have, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=383.2s)]
*  And politics, at least in my view, particularly these days, is often about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=386.72s)]
*  the lesser of two easels. It's about harm reduction. Sometimes even it's about [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=392.24s)]
*  choosing the bad over the cataclysmic. And from that perspective, it's just [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=397.24s)]
*  undoubtedly a good thing. The Coat Network is making this realization about [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  Haley as the last viable option and this investment. It's a positive thing that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=405.6s)]
*  Wall Street executives are telling people they should back Haley for the good of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=409.8s)]
*  the country. It is to the benefit of American democracy for there to be a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=412.72s)]
*  strong faction of the Republican Party, one of the two major ones we have, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=416.52s)]
*  committed to defeating Donald Trump. And to be clear, they have a strong case to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  make. I mean, it's been fairly well shown now that Haley would be a strong general [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=424.44s)]
*  election candidate. The polling reliably shows us. In fact, in lots of polls, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=429.84s)]
*  she's the one candidate polling above Trump and head to heads. She's got [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=433.68s)]
*  executive experience. She's got foreign policy experience. More cynically, the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=436.76s)]
*  polls show she's a formidable nominee. Recent poll from Marquette Law School [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=440.56s)]
*  shows Haley beating Joe Biden by double digits, far ahead of Trump and Ron [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=445.32s)]
*  DeSantis. And of course, there's also the element of poetic justice at play for [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=448.88s)]
*  the Republicans. I mean, here's the reality. Nominating anyone other than [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=453.88s)]
*  Donald Trump would almost certainly rip the party asunder. It might even break it [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=457.52s)]
*  in its current name and form. I mean, Trump would then set himself to the goal [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=461.48s)]
*  of the total destruction of the Republican Party, just like he did against [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=467.0s)]
*  America as a whole, should they nominate anyone other than him. The fact that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  the matter is that's probably what the Republican Party deserves. I mean, again, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=475.04s)]
*  if I'm writing the script here, I mean, do we destroy by the monster they created [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=481.04s)]
*  enabled for the better part of a decade? Nikki Haley included, as you know, from [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=484.6s)]
*  the open. And they all know that threat hangs over them. So anyone who takes up [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=488.36s)]
*  the effort to defeat Trump, really, to really go after him, to try to beat him [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=494.64000000000004s)]
*  in this Republican primary anyway, deserve support. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRQycDkftg&t=498.76s)]
