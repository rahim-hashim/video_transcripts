# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 15
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc)
*  Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians just over a month and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=0.0s)]
*  created a humanitarian disaster. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=6.32s)]
*  Israeli officials have said this work for months or even years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Have you communicated to Prime Minister Netanyahu any sort of deadline or timeframe for how [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=12.76s)]
*  long you are willing to support Israel in this operation? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=17.48s)]
*  Are you comfortable with the operation going on indefinitely, and is there any deal underway [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=20.82s)]
*  to free Haas? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=24.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Yes, no. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=28.2s)]
*  Working backwards, forward. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=30.52s)]
*  Look, I have been deeply involved in moving on the hostages negotiation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=32.08s)]
*  And I don't want to get ahead of myself here because I don't know what's happened in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=41.32s)]
*  the last four hours. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=46.08s)]
*  But I have gotten great cooperation from Qataris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=47.2s)]
*  I've spoken with them as well a number of times. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=55.04s)]
*  I think the pause that Israelis have agreed to is down to, I'm getting too into too much [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=59.68s)]
*  detail. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=68.4s)]
*  I know, Mr. Secretary, I'm going to stop. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=69.4s)]
*  But I am mildly hopeful. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=72.24s)]
*  I'm mildly hopeful. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=75.92s)]
*  With regard to when is this going to stop? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=78.84s)]
*  I think it's going to stop when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and abuse [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  and just do horrific things to the Israelis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  And they still think, at least as of this point, they still thought they could. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=100.28s)]
*  I guess the best way for me to say it is that I take a look. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=106.36s)]
*  The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledges they have an obligation to use as much caution [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=116.96s)]
*  as they can in going after their targets. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=127.0s)]
*  It's not like they're rushing to the hospital knocking down doors and pulling people aside [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=129.92s)]
*  and shooting people indiscriminately. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=135.08s)]
*  But Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking Israelis again. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  And this is a terrible dilemma. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=144.84s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  I think that Israel is also taking risks themselves about their folks being killed and one-to-one [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  going through these hospital rooms, hospital halls. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=159.44s)]
*  But one thing has been established is that Hamas does have headquarters, weapons, materiel [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=163.56s)]
*  below this hospital. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=171.56s)]
*  And I suspect others. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=173.36s)]
*  But how long it's going to last, I don't know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=175.32s)]
*  Look, I've made it clear to the Israelis that Dabibi enters war cabinet. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=178.48s)]
*  So I think the only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that's real. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=190.28s)]
*  We got to get to the point where there is an ability to be able to even talk without [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=194.56s)]
*  worrying about whether or not we're just dealing with, they're dealing with Hamas that's going [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=200.36s)]
*  to engage in the same activities they did over the past, on the 7th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=205.24s)]
*  So it's, but I can't tell, I'm not a fortune teller, I can't tell you how long it's going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=211.16s)]
*  to last. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=215.48s)]
*  I can tell you I don't think it ultimately ends until there's a two-state solution. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=216.48s)]
*  I made it clear to the Israelis, I think it's a big mistake for them to think they're going [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=221.16s)]
*  to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=224.92s)]
*  I don't think that works. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  And so I think you're going to see efforts to bring along, well, I shouldn't go in anymore [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=229.72s)]
*  because that's the things I've been negotiating with Arab countries and others about what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=236.56s)]
*  the next steps are. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  But anyway, thank you all very much. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=243.92s)]
*  Appreciate it very much. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=246.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=247.4s)]
*  This ends the press conference. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=248.4s)]
*  In a very busy day for President Joe Biden, who just got out of that summit and a press [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=249.4s)]
*  conference today, he's also today found time to explicitly condemn the fascist language [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=257.76s)]
*  of Donald Trump, comparing it to phrases from Nazi Germany. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=263.0s)]
*  Donald Trump made those comments at a campaign rally over the weekend, referring to his political [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  opponents as, quote, vermin. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=271.56s)]
*  I think it's important to note that Donald Trump isn't just echoing fascist language, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=274.12s)]
*  which has been kind of the theme of the coverage. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=278.36s)]
*  He is specifically choosing his words in an effort to dehumanize his enemies and target [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=279.96s)]
*  them for violence. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=285.92s)]
*  Vermin are animals who cause problems and disease and need to be trapped and killed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=288.4s)]
*  That is what you are implying when you call other human beings, your political foes, your [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=295.2s)]
*  fellow citizens, your fellow Americans vermin. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  That is fascist language. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  Using that language is fascist. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=304.56s)]
*  Sadly, none of this is theoretical or abstract. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  Political violence has been a through line in the Trump era, starting from his earliest [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  rallies when the ex-president explicitly endorsed and encouraged violence against protesters. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  At the conclusion of his presidency, he incited a violent mob to sack the Capitol. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=321.76s)]
*  Recently, he has been fixated on a particularly ghastly example of political violence, the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=327.96s)]
*  attack on former speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, last October. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=332.52s)]
*  Over a year later, the perpetrator of that attack is now on trial, and his testimony [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=339.44s)]
*  has not received anywhere near the enough attention. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  And it deserves that attention because the story of this attack is a story of precisely [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=347.68s)]
*  how right-wing political violence comes about in this country in this moment, in the age [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=353.24s)]
*  of Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  Remember, it was just over a week before the midterm elections last fall when we learned [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=360.76s)]
*  of the violent invasion at the home of then-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=366.08s)]
*  Eighty-two-year-old Paul Pelosi underwent surgery today after being struck with a hammer, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=371.48s)]
*  suffering a skull fracture in the early morning attack. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  The police say the suspect is alleged assailant, a 42-year-old man charged tonight with attempted [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=380.52s)]
*  homicide. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  The intruder allegedly demanding to see the speaker. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi, second in the presidential line of succession, as we noted, was not home [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=389.4s)]
*  at the time of the attack. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  And though police say a motive has not been determined, the circumstances of the assault [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=396.2s)]
*  are only deepening the chill felt by many in Congress in what authorities say is a more [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=400.96s)]
*  threatening political climate. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  It was an incredibly upsetting situation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=408.88s)]
*  It did appear from the very beginning the attack was likely political in nature. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=410.96s)]
*  And that became increasingly clear as more details started to emerge. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=415.08s)]
*  The assailant himself, 42-year-old David De Pape, told police that he broke into the home [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=418.12s)]
*  with items including zip ties, tape, rope, and a hammer intending to hold Speaker Pelosi [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=425.44s)]
*  hostage. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=431.36s)]
*  He wanted to interrogate her. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=432.68s)]
*  And if she lied, he said he was going to break her kneecaps. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=434.42s)]
*  We learned about the assailant's ideology and online presence where he, quote, had been [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=439.58000000000004s)]
*  drifting further into the world of far-right conspiracies, anti-Semitism, and hate, as [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  the Los Angeles Times put it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  Quote, his screeds included posts about QAnon, an unfounded theory that former President [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=449.70000000000005s)]
*  Trump is at war with the cabal of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring and control [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=454.98s)]
*  the world. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  And then instead of accepting those facts, we saw this concerted effort from the right [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=461.42s)]
*  wing to obfuscate exactly what happened. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=466.86s)]
*  Almost immediately, they tried to muddy the waters, to confuse people, to hide what we [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=471.06s)]
*  then knew, what was staring us in the face, that this was an example of political violence [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=474.88s)]
*  inspired by the same fetid ideology that Donald Trump was using to his benefit. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=480.22s)]
*  These people did everything they could to pretend this guy isn't exactly what he so [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=489.58s)]
*  clearly was. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=492.85999999999996s)]
*  So they made up all sorts of disgusting stories. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=494.8s)]
*  They just, remember this? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=497.4s)]
*  They just made up the lie that the brutal attack on this man was some sort of lover's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  quarrel, just fabricated out of thin air, just a fabrication to cover for a violent [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=505.02s)]
*  right-wing assault, a guy who had been clearly been influenced by violent right-wing rhetoric. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=510.82s)]
*  And this was not fringe. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=515.78s)]
*  I want to be clear, Republican members of Congress, Trump Jr., even Elon Musk, elevated [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=516.78s)]
*  that lie. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=523.4599999999999s)]
*  They made it a central part of the discourse. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=524.4599999999999s)]
*  We saw all kinds of obfuscation about the assailants' politics. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=527.18s)]
*  Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas signed onto this claim that it is absurd to try to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  paint a hippie nudist from Berkeley as some kind of militant right-winger. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=536.3399999999999s)]
*  Now I should note here, thankfully, Paul Pelosi recovered after ongoing surgery to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=541.26s)]
*  repair a skull fracture. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=546.7s)]
*  It could have been so much worse. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  And we should keep in mind that it was the second act of serious right-wing political [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=552.1400000000001s)]
*  violence in the run-up to an election in the Trump era. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=555.22s)]
*  The last midterms, 2018, a man who became known as the MAGA bomber mailed 16 packages [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=558.46s)]
*  containing actual pipe bombs to Democratic politicians and other critics of Donald Trump. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=563.4200000000001s)]
*  He tried to blow them up. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  But this utterly horrifying story, which serves as a greatest warning to us all, became a [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  punchline on the right among conservatives. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=575.66s)]
*  Now I don't actually think they're joking about Paul Pelosi's violent attack because [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=579.54s)]
*  they think it's funny. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  They're joking about it because that joking signals to their audience that what happened [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=585.3399999999999s)]
*  is fine. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=590.62s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, well, she's got protection when she's in DC. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=593.62s)]
*  Apparently her house doesn't have a lot of protection. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=596.54s)]
*  She's losing the gavel but finding the hammer. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=599.4599999999999s)]
*  Too soon? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=604.66s)]
*  Is that too soon? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=605.66s)]
*  We had no terror during my administration. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=607.5s)]
*  The only terror we had was Nancy Pelosi who's a crazed lunatic. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=610.38s)]
*  She's a lunatic. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=614.38s)]
*  She is a crazed lunatic. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=618.9399999999999s)]
*  What the hell was going on with her husband? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=620.86s)]
*  Let's not end. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=623.06s)]
*  Let's not end. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=624.06s)]
*  I'll withdraw that statement. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=625.06s)]
*  By the way, she's going to walk around her house. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=626.06s)]
*  Obviously in that case it didn't work very well. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=631.4599999999999s)]
*  That is what Donald Trump said this past weekend, a few days ago. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=634.78s)]
*  It's part of the Stump Speech. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=640.06s)]
*  He's still talking and joking about the 82-year-old husband of the Speaker of the House being [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=641.18s)]
*  violently assaulted with a hammer to his head causing a skull fracture. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=648.4599999999999s)]
*  He's joking about that to the audience who all laugh with him about how funny it is that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=653.38s)]
*  this man was violently assaulted. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=658.0999999999999s)]
*  And he's doing this while David De Pape is on trial in federal court in California. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=660.74s)]
*  Yesterday he stood up to testify on her oath and described what was clear from the beginning [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=665.38s)]
*  or should have been clear to Donald Trump and all of his allies. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=669.22s)]
*  He said he went to the Pelosi's home as part of a bigger plot to end what he viewed as [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=673.7s)]
*  government corruption. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=677.74s)]
*  And he tearfully recounted about his political leanings went from leftist to, yes, right-wing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=678.74s)]
*  After reading a comment on a YouTube video about former President Donald Trump, he became [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=685.22s)]
*  radicalized towards this right-wing violence through the MAGA cult of Donald Trump. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=692.46s)]
*  These are the real stakes, the debate about Trump's rhetoric and his fascist behavior. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=697.86s)]
*  It leads his people to believe that political violence is okay, that it's desirable, that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=701.4200000000001s)]
*  their political enemies are subhuman, and if you bash their head with a hammer, it's [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=705.22s)]
*  funny. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=708.86s)]
*  This movement has gotten people hurt and more people are going to get hurt until the movement [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=710.74s)]
*  is stopped. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w5wgnav3jc&t=715.3s)]
