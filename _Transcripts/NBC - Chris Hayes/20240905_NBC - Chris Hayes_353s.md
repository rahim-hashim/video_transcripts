# ‘Follow the money’: What Clarence Thomas and those MAGA influencers have in common
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI)
*  In the wake of this incredibly embarrassing indictment that shows several online right-wing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=0.0s)]
*  figures like that, figure like that right-wing commentator you just heard, Tim Poole, that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  they were allegedly unwitting secret paid agents of the Russian government, attempted [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=9.32s)]
*  to sabotage our election and sow discord among the American populace. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=13.8s)]
*  Many of those right-wing personalities had become very defensive. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=16.96s)]
*  A couple of them called it a leaked indictment, which was funny, even though it's just a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=20.04s)]
*  public court document. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=23.76s)]
*  Poole did at least revise his response, and that was pointed out to him. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=26.0s)]
*  The point that many of them have been making, or the defenders have been making to the extent [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=29.88s)]
*  they are presenting any defense at all, is to say, look, I didn't know where the money [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=33.0s)]
*  was from. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=36.28s)]
*  I was paid to say what I would have said anyway. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=37.28s)]
*  And honestly, I believe they're telling the truth on that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=40.28s)]
*  All the anti-immigrant rhetoric and the vile culture war bigotry is the kind of stuff they [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=43.96s)]
*  were saying before the Russians showed up to pay them for it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=48.16s)]
*  It's always the way this stuff works. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Most effective tactic to manipulate public opinion through foreign influence were to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=54.56s)]
*  change laws on behalf of the wealthy interests, is not to find someone who is opposed to what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=58.56s)]
*  you want to do and then give them cash and have them renounce publicly and tell them [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=63.64s)]
*  what to say. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=67.2s)]
*  No, instead it's to go out and find people that are already aligned with those interests [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=68.2s)]
*  and then just subsidize the hell out of those folks by throwing money at them, by raising [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=72.88s)]
*  their profiles so they can just keep doing what they were already doing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=77.64s)]
*  And ideally, they do it for a long time, and they're comfortable doing it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=82.18s)]
*  Comfortable, in this case, to the tune of $100,000 per video, which I gotta say is pretty [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=86.2s)]
*  cushy in the world of digital media. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=93.96s)]
*  And if that whole scheme sounds kind of familiar, that is because it is basically the same arrangement [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=97.84s)]
*  set up for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas by billionaire benefactors like Harlan [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=103.2s)]
*  Crowe. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=107.28s)]
*  According to all the reporting we have, Thomas has been given gifts, both disclosed and more [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=108.88s)]
*  significantly undisclosed, to the tune of $4 million over the past 20 years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=113.4s)]
*  That leads to that's how much we know about as of now, thanks to some real dogged reporting [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=119.28s)]
*  about outlets like ProPublica. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=123.72s)]
*  You can see in this chart just how much he's been given. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=126.0s)]
*  Can you see Thomas there? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=128.34s)]
*  You see where he is on the chart? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=129.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's there on the left. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=130.6s)]
*  He's the huge red bar, and that's in comparison to the other justices. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  And every time Thomas gets caught being gifted a yacht trip or an RV loan that was unforgiven [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=137.66s)]
*  or tuition payment for family, his defenders essentially say the very same thing that those [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=143.0s)]
*  right-wing influencers and their defenders say, look, Clarence Thomas didn't change his [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=147.16s)]
*  mind. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=151.0s)]
*  He's just ruling the way he would have anyway. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=152.0s)]
*  And like those influencers, that's pretty much true. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  Clarence Thomas is a right-wing dude. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=159.16s)]
*  He's a deeply conservative guy and would, at least I think in most cases and most issues, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  not at all, probably rule in ways favorable to Harlan Crow and his billionaire ilk regardless. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=166.12s)]
*  But that's not the point, is it? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=174.6s)]
*  You do not have to change his views. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=177.6s)]
*  You just need to incentivize him to stay on the court, offer him some gifts to continue [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=179.36s)]
*  doing what he's doing already. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=187.26s)]
*  And the problem with all this is that not only does he get a ridiculous amount of gifts [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=190.8s)]
*  for doing what he does, his ethical compromises are extended in every direction. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=194.2s)]
*  That includes his wife, Ginny, who is this right-wing activist, professional right-wing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=199.84s)]
*  activist involved in all sorts of causes, including stuff having to do January 6th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=205.16s)]
*  And in the face of efforts by Democrats to crack down on this kind of insane ethical [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=211.4s)]
*  violation, to reform the court, to bind it by even the most basic set of ethics that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=217.16s)]
*  say members of Congress or every single federal employee has to abide by, in the wake of those [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=222.08s)]
*  efforts ProPublica just unearthed new revelations about a group working to help Justice Clarence [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=227.96s)]
*  Thomas fight efforts to rein in the court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  They obtained audio of the president of a religious liberty group reading an email from [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  Thomas's wife Ginny profusely thanking them for fighting for Clarence Thomas's right [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  to essentially keep accepting amazing gifts without any ethics rules. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=246.4s)]
*  Let me say one thing that's an encouragement, I think it will be an encouragement because [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=251.76s)]
*  the people on this call are our very top supporters. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  I got an email today from Ginny Thomas, Justice Thomas's wife. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=260.64s)]
*  So I want to read that to you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=267.48s)]
*  She said, great to meet through the meetings today. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  I cannot adequately express enough appreciation for you guys pulling into reacting to the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=273.68s)]
*  Biden effort on the Supreme Court. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  And then this is in all caps. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=283.08s)]
*  You guys have filled the sails of many judges. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=284.92s)]
*  Can I just tell you thank you? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  And this is all caps. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=291.0s)]
*  Thank you so, so, so much. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=291.88s)]
*  So it's neat that, you know, you know, those of you on the call are a part of protecting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=294.2s)]
*  the future of our court and they really appreciate it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  Our court. Notice he said our court. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=303.16s)]
*  They really appreciate it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=304.92s)]
*  Meeting the justices, meaning not just Ginny, because she's a spokesperson for her husband [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=306.2s)]
*  in that case. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=310.44s)]
*  These billionaires and interest groups need Justice Thomas to stay where he is and are [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=311.96s)]
*  lavishing gifts on him to ensure he will remain on the court. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=315.52s)]
*  And it's just not that different from the Russians paying online right wing personalities [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=319.2s)]
*  huge sum of money to keep doing what they were doing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=323.36s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, Clarence Thomas is just the Tim Pool of the Supreme Court. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-BTcageTI&t=327.76s)]
