# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0)
*  To be clear, whatever happens to your little leader, it's going to be because of the actions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=0.0s)]
*  that he took. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=7.92s)]
*  So you can talk all you want to about how January 6th was nonsense, but all of y'all [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=8.96s)]
*  were running at that time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=13.52s)]
*  Y'all were grabbing y'all's gas masks and y'all were running to your offices because [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  you didn't know if they were coming to kill you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=18.64s)]
*  You should have cared that somebody was there to protect you, but instead you want to play [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=21.12s)]
*  games because you found out that it was your leader that decided that he wanted to propagate [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=24.92s)]
*  an insurrection on our country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  So don't tell me that you care about the Constitution, because you don't. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=33.0s)]
*  That is Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett shaming Republicans on the House Oversight [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=37.300000000000004s)]
*  Committee in which she sits over their pro-Trump obstructionism in a hearing where those Republicans [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  voted to recommend a contempt charge against Hunter Biden, who is not a public servant [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  but is named Biden. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  That is what the House Republican majority considers governance in 2024. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=52.44s)]
*  And Congresswoman Crockett joins me now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=57.08s)]
*  It was messy today inside that hearing room, which I guess is sort of par for the course. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=60.72s)]
*  What is your takeaway from today in terms of what they are after, what they're trying [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=68.64s)]
*  to do? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=72.0s)]
*  So you're insinuating that I learned something. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=73.0s)]
*  I don't know if there's anything to be learned actually. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=77.12s)]
*  I watched part of it and didn't glean a ton. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=80.24s)]
*  It didn't reveal anything more than what we already know, which is that this is more so [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=84.32s)]
*  just about making sure that they are showing their loyalty to Trump and that Trump can [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=88.88s)]
*  pat them on the back and hopefully won't go against them and cause them a problem in their [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=94.52s)]
*  primary. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=100.16s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the American people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=101.16s)]
*  It has nothing to do with truth and transparency. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=102.56s)]
*  It has nothing to do with fairness. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=105.16s)]
*  It has everything to do with making sure that they are pleasing to Trump. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=107.36s)]
*  You know, you made that point I just want to circle back to, which is to the extent [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=111.28s)]
*  there's an actual sort of substantive conflict being litigated here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=114.12s)]
*  It's about Hunter Biden and testimony. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Hunter Biden has volunteered to give sworn testimony under oath to the committee in public. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  And they say they don't want that because they want to do it behind closed doors. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=125.56s)]
*  And the point, as I understand that you were making, is it's understandable to not want [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  to do that precisely because the fear that that transcript would then be selectively [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=134.12s)]
*  leaked in a way that is, you know, intentionally deceptive. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=143.28s)]
*  I call it alternative facts or lies, however you want to couch it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=144.28s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  We know that they have a history of changing the facts to suit whatever their mission is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  at that moment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=158.52s)]
*  And so if I'm Hunter and I am under criminal investigation, the last thing that I want [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=160.76s)]
*  is the court trying to chase down information that allegedly came out behind closed doors. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=166.0s)]
*  He's trying to say that I'm here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=172.44s)]
*  He said that on the day that he was subpoenaed to appear, he showed up at the Capitol. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=174.27999999999997s)]
*  He was ready and willing to do it in public. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  He showed up today as we were debating whether or not there should be. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=181.32s)]
*  And actually, we weren't even supposed to be debating. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=185.04s)]
*  What we were supposed to be doing was marking up this dag on bill that we're maybe going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=187.4s)]
*  to have on the floor. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=191.2s)]
*  Who knows if they'll get that far as it relates to whether or not he should be found in contempt [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=192.2s)]
*  for violating this subpoena. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=199.2s)]
*  And I want people to understand about contempt. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=201.24s)]
*  Contempt is usually this intentional disregard. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=204.12s)]
*  What Hunter has done is made it clear that he is not intentionally disregarding anything. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=207.0s)]
*  And the chair wants to go back on his word when he said, you can do this or you can do [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=216.88s)]
*  Now you say, never mind, I want to do either one of them because now you showed up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=217.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's an important point, too. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=221.24s)]
*  This is something that you and some of your colleagues highlighted. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  There are members of the House Republican majority, including Jim Jordan, Scott Perry [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=226.2s)]
*  and others who are serving members who were issued subpoenas who did just essentially [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  tear them up and ignore them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  There was no, they didn't say, yes, I'll come under these conditions and enter into a sort [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=236.0s)]
*  of negotiation over accommodations. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=239.64s)]
*  They basically said, no, we're going to tear it up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=241.92s)]
*  They're still sitting in Congress and they haven't they haven't been recommended for [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=244.68s)]
*  contempt, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=247.68s)]
*  No, they haven't been. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=249.68s)]
*  And they absolutely voted to make sure that Hunter could be held in contempt. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=252.12s)]
*  Their excuse is that the January 6th committee was not a valid committee. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  This is their opinion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=261.76s)]
*  The courts have determined that to be not the case. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=262.76s)]
*  And basically, our chairman said, well, you guys were in the majority. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=267.16s)]
*  You could have held him in contempt. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=270.88s)]
*  You chose not to hold him in contempt. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=271.88s)]
*  And it was made clear that they ran out of time as they were going through all of the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  court proceedings fighting with them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=278.36s)]
*  And at the end of the day, January 6th committee ended up with an overwhelming amount of evidence. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  And that is why we have a former president that is facing four different indictments [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  with 91 counts total. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  There was there was something very, you know, this Congress today, which was this was happening [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  in the House in your committee. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=298.66s)]
*  At the same time, there was a sort of procedural vote on what's called the rule, right, which [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=301.42s)]
*  was to move to I think a government funding bill. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=305.54s)]
*  And the rule died. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=310.86s)]
*  Now, the rule should pass along party lines. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=312.26000000000005s)]
*  Leadership wanted everyone to vote for the rule. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  Twelve Republicans, I think, broke ranks. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  The rule died, which is a weird procedural thing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=319.42s)]
*  But that was the kind of canary in the coal mine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  The last time we had a leadership crisis, I feel like maybe we're headed towards a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  another one. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  We're in a constant state of crisis in the U.S. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=331.66s)]
*  House, and we won't get out of it until Hakeem Jeffries becomes the speaker, which will [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  hopefully be sooner rather than later, knowing that they have this very slim majority right [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=339.3s)]
*  now. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=343.14000000000004s)]
*  You never know. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  We are very close right now to hopefully getting the speaker, Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=345.70000000000005s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=348.94s)]
*  What happens is MAGA will vote with the Democrats and kill things all the time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=350.3s)]
*  They can't do it by themselves. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=356.14000000000004s)]
*  But what they don't realize, I don't know why they haven't learned yet, that that gives [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=358.3s)]
*  us more leverage because the Democrats are ready and willing to work. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  We're just not ready and willing to work on nonsense. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=366.3s)]
*  It's going to hurt the American people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  And so what happens is you have a speaker that has to come over to the Democrats because [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  we will at least talk and try to compromise and come up with something. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=374.54s)]
*  That's how we had the continuing resolutions to make sure that the government was kept [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  open was because we were willing to work on behalf of the American people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=381.98s)]
*  All right, Congressman Jasmine Crockett of Texas, thanks for your time today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=385.5s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=388.38s)]
*  They are now awaiting a decision any day, any moment from the D.C. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=390.38s)]
*  Court of Appeals on whether Donald Trump is immune, as he claims, from criminal charges [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=393.29999999999995s)]
*  for attempting to overturn the election. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=397.38s)]
*  In yesterday's hearing on this, the three judges in the panel certainly seem skeptical. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=399.62s)]
*  Conservative attorney George Conway, who was in that courtroom, points out that Trump's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=404.5s)]
*  lawyers had a difficult case to begin with because their position is clearly not correct [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=408.29999999999995s)]
*  under either precedent or the Constitution. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=413.26000000000005s)]
*  But in making the arguments they had, they also fell into a trap. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=415.26000000000005s)]
*  It happened when one judge, Florence Pan, pressed Trump's lawyers on the implications [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  of his argument. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=424.42s)]
*  Could a president who ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival who was not [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=426.42s)]
*  impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=431.54s)]
*  If he were impeached and convicted first. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=435.70000000000005s)]
*  In response to that moment, Conway writes, quote, The damage was done and Pan's point [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=438.78s)]
*  was devastatingly made. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=443.78s)]
*  On the one hand, Trump's lawyer argued the Constitution gave the president absolute immunity [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=445.17999999999995s)]
*  for his official acts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=449.73999999999995s)]
*  On the other hand, if the United States Congress effectively gives permission by impeaching [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=450.73999999999995s)]
*  and convicting, well, then yes, a president can be prosecuted and wait for it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=454.38s)]
*  He's not absolutely immune. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=458.34s)]
*  George Conway joins me now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=460.7s)]
*  He's a contributing writer for The Atlantic. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=461.97999999999996s)]
*  So I found your argument here interesting and it was not the way it didn't dawn on me [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=463.66s)]
*  in the same way that it did to you, that moment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=470.22s)]
*  And I want you to explain why that and Judge Pan was very focused on it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=473.5s)]
*  She kept coming at it again and again and again. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  Why that moment was so important for his Trump's argument sort of collapse? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=481.3s)]
*  Well, there are a couple of reasons for that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=488.42s)]
*  I mean, first of all, Judge Pan was trying to do two things as I see it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=490.58s)]
*  One was she was trying to elicit a concession from Trump's counsel that his position was [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=495.62s)]
*  extreme. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=503.18s)]
*  And at the same time, when Trump's counsel resisted saying that, yes, a president is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=504.18s)]
*  absolutely immune for sending in SEAL Team 6, she then sort of went to the underbelly [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=510.82s)]
*  of the argument that he was making as to why it wasn't always the case, which was this [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=521.46s)]
*  argument based upon the secondary provision that Trump relies on, which is the impeachment [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=525.9s)]
*  judgment clause, which says that you can prosecute somebody criminally after you impeach and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=531.54s)]
*  remove them through Congress. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=538.34s)]
*  And her point really was that there was a tension between those two positions. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=541.7800000000001s)]
*  In addition to the fact that the position he was taking was extreme under one clause, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=545.82s)]
*  the second clause, I mean, the second provision, which is the impeachment judgment provision, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=550.58s)]
*  basically undercuts the absolute immunity claim because it makes clear that officeholders, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=555.98s)]
*  and it doesn't exclude the president, can be prosecuted after being removed from office. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=561.62s)]
*  And so she kept drilling on that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=566.78s)]
*  And then she makes the point that, OK, well, if you're saying that he can be prosecuted [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=569.54s)]
*  under some circumstances when Congress does impeach and convict and remove a president, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=574.18s)]
*  you're not saying he's absolutely immune. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  And so that's the reason why Trump's position collapsed was it was not only was it extreme, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=583.28s)]
*  but it was at war with itself. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=592.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=595.14s)]
*  And when you get that kind of and the other thing that made it worse for Trump's lawyer [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=596.78s)]
*  is when you're going to have to make a concession to a judge who is very smart and is not going [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=601.38s)]
*  to let things go, you make the concession. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=607.78s)]
*  You say, yes, that's I mean, because it is their position that a president who's not [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=611.22s)]
*  impeached and removed can get away with anything. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=615.54s)]
*  It has to be their position because there's not much worse other than perhaps sending [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=617.9399999999999s)]
*  SEAL Team Six to the Capitol than what he did. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=622.3s)]
*  So you know, sometimes you just have to accept the fact that your position is out there because [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=626.0999999999999s)]
*  it's the only one you can take. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=631.42s)]
*  Now it's a loser to be sure. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=632.9s)]
*  But you do not make a weak argument stronger by blending it with an even weaker one. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=635.3399999999999s)]
*  That is appellate advocacy 101 in addition to, you know, answer the questions. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=640.26s)]
*  So that's such an interesting and I think really important point. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=646.54s)]
*  I just want to stay with it for a second because I think it's key. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=648.54s)]
*  The opening bid right from Trump's lawyers is he is absolutely immune for official acts [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=651.1s)]
*  at the outer perimeter of his official duties. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=656.86s)]
*  And that means anything from sending SEAL Team Six as Jack Smith's office, I think, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=659.22s)]
*  smartly sort of raised to selling pardons. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=664.34s)]
*  These are clearly, we would say, criminal enterprises, but they're they intermix with [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=666.6800000000001s)]
*  official acts. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=671.5s)]
*  And what you're saying is rather what they realized, I think, is that that was too extreme [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  and they needed a fallback. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=677.4200000000001s)]
*  So they've concocted this sort of, you know, for FACACTA. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=679.34s)]
*  FACACTA is a good word. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=684.02s)]
*  FACACTA, Rube Goldberg. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=685.98s)]
*  Michigan also would be a good word too. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=686.98s)]
*  Construction which is like this weird impeachment thing. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=689.7s)]
*  And you're saying by constructing the fallback so that you're not making the extreme argument, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=692.94s)]
*  you're also undercutting the clarity of the argument itself. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=697.34s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=701.5400000000001s)]
*  And it goes even beyond the fact that it's that the impeachment judgment clause is inconsistent [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=702.5400000000001s)]
*  with absolute presidential criminal immunity. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=708.7s)]
*  The rationales that he was presenting were inconsistent. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=713.6600000000001s)]
*  His rationale that he kept repeating to the panel, Sauer, Trump's lawyer, he kept saying [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  the reason why we have to have absolute criminal immunity is because of the specter that some [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=726.94s)]
*  other president, his client actually, might go and start prosecuting, engaging in political [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=733.62s)]
*  prosecutions to punish his enemies. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=739.22s)]
*  Okay, well that's not a crazy argument. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=741.62s)]
*  We don't want political prosecutions of politicians for simply doing their jobs. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=745.22s)]
*  On the other hand, the argument that he said that, well, you can prosecute a president [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=750.86s)]
*  when the Congress of the United States says you can. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=756.26s)]
*  Excuse me, that's the most political spot in the universe right there. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=765.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=766.26s)]
*  Come on. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=767.26s)]
*  So his argument made no sense on many levels. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=768.26s)]
*  That is a really, really excellent point. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=771.78s)]
*  And thank you for the backdrop. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=773.5s)]
*  It really helped. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=775.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=776.02s)]
*  Well, we can't. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=777.02s)]
*  George Conway, who was in that room, who himself has been around the D.C. Circuit and argued [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=778.02s)]
*  in that venue. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=783.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=784.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=785.38s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIpuAg5Ee0&t=786.38s)]
