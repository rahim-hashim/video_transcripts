# ‘Freakishly rare’ Mitt Romney takes no prisoners as he announces he won’t seek re-election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs)
*  I've spent my last 25 years in public service of one kind or another. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=0.0s)]
*  At the end of another term, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  I'd be in my mid-80s. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=8.24s)]
*  Frankly, it's time for a new generation of leaders. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=10.72s)]
*  They're the ones that need to make the decisions that will [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=15.18s)]
*  shape the world they will be living in. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=18.1s)]
*  Today, that man, Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=20.82s)]
*  announced he would not run for re-election and would [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=23.78s)]
*  step down when his term expires in January 2025. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=26.0s)]
*  Thus will end the political career of a man who has, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=29.78s)]
*  to my mind, improbably become one of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=33.300000000000004s)]
*  the most fascinating political figures of our times. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  Romney is in the twilight, as you said, of his political career. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=38.96s)]
*  He staked out a non-MAGA Republican position after he was elected in 2018, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=42.0s)]
*  spending his Senate term as basically a relatively normal, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=46.78s)]
*  conscientious non-Trump conservative. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  That itself undersells just how freakishly rare such a stance was. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=53.64s)]
*  He was basically the only one. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=58.94s)]
*  Now, he's taking no prisoners on his way out by way of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  a forthcoming tell-all biography written by McCabe Coppens, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=63.94s)]
*  who was given extraordinary access to the Senator and his files, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=67.34s)]
*  including journals and diaries. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=71.06s)]
*  Excerpts were published from that book today in The Atlantic and in them, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=73.02s)]
*  Romney recounts several stories including during the investigation that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=76.18s)]
*  led to Donald Trump's first impeachment when [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=79.5s)]
*  then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump to stop attacking Romney on Twitter. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=84.52s)]
*  Romney thanked McConnell for sticking up for him against Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=87.26s)]
*  You're lucky, McConnell continued, you can say the things we all think. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=91.22s)]
*  You're in a position to say things about him we all agree with but can't say. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=94.98s)]
*  Tim Miller is a former spokesman for the RNC and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=99.38s)]
*  former communications director for Jeb Bush's 2016 campaign. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=101.5s)]
*  He's now a writer at Larif the Bullwork where he wrote today about Romney's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=105.06s)]
*  announcement. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=107.86s)]
*  You're shaking your head because it's like, what I found, this by the way, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=108.5s)]
*  the excerpt's amazing, I think the book's gonna be phenomenal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=111.58s)]
*  What I found fascinating about it, again, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=114.66s)]
*  it was a little like when Jack Smith charged Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=116.7s)]
*  Just the like, I'm not crazy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=120.78s)]
*  Like obviously the people up close to Donald Trump look at the guy and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=122.34s)]
*  think, this guy should not be president. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  Of course he shouldn't be president. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=129.82s)]
*  And Mitt Romney just saying, yes, behind closed doors, that's what they all say. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=130.9s)]
*  Was not surprising, but there was something like water is wet, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=137.26s)]
*  two plus two equals four about it, for me. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=140.82s)]
*  For sure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=142.74s)]
*  First I just have to say, it just caught me off guard when I heard him say that he [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=145.46s)]
*  would be in his mid-80s again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=148.82000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the milk, there's something about the milk diet, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  cuz Romney looks great. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  He sure does. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  He's got some picture of himself in an attic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  I had a half there was Mitch McConnell saying, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=157.3s)]
*  you're saying the things that we can't say. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=160.34s)]
*  But that's wrong, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=162.86s)]
*  Like Mitt is saying the things that they won't say, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=164.58s)]
*  that they're unwilling to say. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=166.78s)]
*  And not really very many people tried to say them and survive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=168.7s)]
*  I always said to the Republican politicians that still called me, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=173.74s)]
*  that's a dwindling number. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=177.22s)]
*  But the ones who did, I was like, you don't have to be me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=178.14s)]
*  You don't have to go on Chris Hayes and just troll Trump and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=180.3s)]
*  every possible opportunity. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  But you just have to do the right things at the right time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=185.62s)]
*  So you have to convict him when he tries a coup, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=188.14s)]
*  You have to speak out when he's saying that we should send American [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  black women back where they came from, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=194.9s)]
*  That was the minimum bar we were asking for. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=199.1s)]
*  And for some reason Mitt Romney was the only one that stood over it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=201.18s)]
*  And so I think it's sad that he's leaving for that reason. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=204.06s)]
*  That's the other thing about Romney that I find fascinating. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=206.74s)]
*  Again, every time that he would talk about things in the parameters [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=208.74s)]
*  of normal politics, almost, not every time, but often I'd be like, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=213.1s)]
*  no, you're wrong, dude. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=216.7s)]
*  I wouldn't like things he said about the deficit, about the child tax cut, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=217.54s)]
*  about abortion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=221.14s)]
*  I disagree with it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=222.7s)]
*  But it was like, you are recognizably, in a small d sense, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=223.78s)]
*  a Democrat, meaning committed to the project of American democracy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=227.62s)]
*  You were on the same team of we want this thing to continue and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=233.02s)]
*  not feeling like you have that faith in other members of the party is what's so [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=238.46s)]
*  scary about these times to me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=242.34s)]
*  Yeah, and the turnover, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  The more these people leave, they're gonna be replaced by uglier and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=247.02s)]
*  uglier folks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=251.62s)]
*  Just in Utah, there was actually a house primary that didn't get a lot of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=252.74s)]
*  attention where there was one kind of Romneyish, maybe even a little more [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=255.18s)]
*  moderate, frankly, candidate. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=258.58s)]
*  And it was a three way race that she almost kind of luckily stuck through just [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=261.14s)]
*  because of the nature of the primary. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=264.86s)]
*  But she did end up with this super maga that is what is gonna happen again. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=265.94s)]
*  And so, Romney, and I think even viewers who are very progressive, very liberal, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=270.42s)]
*  the other thing that Romney did when he got in there is he was serious about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=274.22s)]
*  governing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=277.22s)]
*  Are you serious about small d democracy? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=277.74s)]
*  Are you serious about governing? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=279.42s)]
*  He did work with Joe Biden and with Democrats on maybe not the child tax [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  credit. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=285.98s)]
*  I'm with you, he probably should have, but on infrastructure, on chips, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=287.06s)]
*  on the gun reform bill, on the electoral count act. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=291.26s)]
*  This is, again, what should be the minimum of what we want from our [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=295.1s)]
*  legislators, but there are just so few of them left. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=299.74s)]
*  He's also a contrast to another person, I think, who sort of holds himself out in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=303.1s)]
*  similar fashion, I think, to Mitt Romney in some ways as a man of integrity, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=306.98s)]
*  as a man of devout belief, which is Mike Pence. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=310.3s)]
*  Romney says this about Pence in the book and in the excerpt. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=312.78s)]
*  He'd long been put off by Pence's pious brand of Trump sycophancy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  No one, he told me, had been more loyal, more willing to smile when he saw [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=320.14s)]
*  absurdities, more willing to ascribe God's will to things that were ungodly [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=323.14s)]
*  than Mike Pence, which is a pretty good turn of phrase. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=327.34s)]
*  And here's what it got Mike Pence. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  Take a look at Mike Pence on the campaign trail today. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=332.46s)]
*  I think this is in Iowa, in Decorahe. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=335.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=337.38s)]
*  Mike Pence, with his money, his Christian fashion, his bullsh** more, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=338.06s)]
*  he didn't even get the f**k out of our country, he didn't get the f**k out of Iowa. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=343.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to put him down as maybe you, buddy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=346.98s)]
*  Mike Pence, who is sort of despised across the political spectrum and has the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=352.94s)]
*  lowest favorabilities, it's a pretty good line there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=356.78s)]
*  But Pence and Romney are really fascinating contrast because they do have [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=359.62s)]
*  some root in some thing that we used to see as kind of religiously imbued [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  conservatism. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=368.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the contrast is in two ways, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=370.62s)]
*  I thought that Mitt put it better than I could of all the reasons why Mike Pence [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  doesn't deserve the credit that he does despite doing the right thing on one day [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=376.58000000000004s)]
*  just because of the level of sycophancy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=380.3s)]
*  But the other interesting thing, I think, in Mitt's comments in the Atlantic [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=383.18s)]
*  Internet video, he still is saying that he, Mitt Romney, believes in these more [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  traditional conservative values, these old classically small liberal values. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=391.3s)]
*  But he's also saying he thinks that a big part of the Republican Party is actively [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=395.7s)]
*  hostile to them and anti-constitution, whereas Mike Pence is thought they're kind [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=399.3s)]
*  of saying we can still fight for this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=402.94s)]
*  And I think that's another just reality check difference that Mitt's on the right [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWVeVzcdqs&t=404.46000000000004s)]
