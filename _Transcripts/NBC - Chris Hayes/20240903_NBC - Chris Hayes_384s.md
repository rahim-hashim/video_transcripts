# Trump campaign putting ‘literally all their money’ on this one path to victory
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The Labor Day holiday is over. It's the first Tuesday of September [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=0.0s)]
*  The first Tuesday of November is Election Day and so that means yes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=5.04s)]
*  It's happening America. We are two months out 63 days to be precise [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=8.48s)]
*  which means the sprint is on to the finish and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=12.76s)]
*  Republicans are getting very very nervous about one thing in particular [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=15.76s)]
*  Party leaders on Capitol Hill are warning their top donors privately and publicly in panic tones [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They need more money to compete with Democratic spending [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=24.799999999999997s)]
*  The head of the Republican Party's Senate campaigns telling Politico the only thing preventing us from having a great night in November is the massive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  Financial disparity our party currently faces now. Let's be clear here [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=35.64s)]
*  It's a fundraiser job to sound panicked and ask for money. Maybe you've seen that in phone texts you've received [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=39.96s)]
*  Democratic donations have been through the roof in every election cycle since Trump became the face of the Republican Party [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Understandably, but this race it looks different and in this case it does look like some of the panic is warranted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=51.6s)]
*  Here's why we don't have a full August fundraising tally yet from both campaigns [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=57.76s)]
*  But in July Harris campaign raised three hundred and ten million dollars more than double the one hundred and thirty eight point seven million dollars [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=62.32s)]
*  Trump raised in the same period and the spending gap between the parties has rarely if ever been as a big as it is today [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=69.04s)]
*  Look at these key battleground states where the situation for Republicans is so stark. Look at those numbers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Pro Harris groups are spending roughly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=83.2s)]
*  Ten times as much as pro Trump groups in buying political ads in Michigan, Nevada [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=86.04s)]
*  North Carolina and Wisconsin [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=92.4s)]
*  Three times as much in the state of Arizona and that's all according to political data analysis from the firm ad impact which tallies [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=94.64s)]
*  These ad buys on television that is a colossal spending disparity you're seeing right there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=101.38000000000001s)]
*  It's the kind that might make a difference in a tight election, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  There are however two state swing states where despite their huge disadvantage right now in fundraising [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=110.9s)]
*  Republicans are keeping face pace with Democratic spending and I think this tells you something about where this race is gonna come down [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  So those would be the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania. Look at those numbers, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=121.9s)]
*  So in those states pro Trump groups seem to be prepared to be outspent [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=125.94s)]
*  Outspent everywhere else that's in play [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=130.96s)]
*  But not in Georgia or Pennsylvania where they're matching pro Harris spending almost dollar for dollar [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=133.48s)]
*  Now the reason of course for this is the electoral college the bizarre [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=141.04s)]
*  Anti-democratic system of presidential voting that says no matter how many people vote for you for president. You still need [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=146.12s)]
*  270 state electors. It's a system that's already caused enormous problems in America [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=152.24s)]
*  Like when George W Bush and Donald Trump both lost the popular vote but won the electoral college [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=157.56s)]
*  And of course, don't forget that in 2020 [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=162.12s)]
*  It was the perverse incentives and the complicated machinery of the electoral college that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=164.32s)]
*  Provided Trump with the opening to try and steal the election with among other things his plan for fake electors a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=169.72s)]
*  Plan that culminated in the January 6th insurrection, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=176.0s)]
*  That was the day that the electoral college votes were gonna be tallied, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=179.2s)]
*  The electoral college is still there it's in the Constitution operating in the background and every single strategic decision [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=183.16s)]
*  both campaigns make are determined by it and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=189.48s)]
*  What you're seeing in the spending the Trump campaign, I think they've got one main path to victory [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=193.04s)]
*  That they appear to be putting literally all their money on and that is basically this map [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=199.76s)]
*  Envision this result. It's pretty much the same as 2020 except so everybody holds the states their power [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=206.12s)]
*  Is one that year in 2020 except Donald Trump flips two states [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=212.12s)]
*  He flips Georgia, which of course Joe Biden famously won by 11,000 votes and he flips, Pennsylvania [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=215.28s)]
*  That gives him 270 electoral votes to 268 for Kamala Harris [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  Under that scenario Trump becomes president again kind of a nightmare map for the Democrats to be honest [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  Harris could sweep the rest of the battleground states and she could win nationwide by millions of votes father 4 million votes 5 million votes [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  6 million votes wouldn't matter as [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=237.84s)]
*  The Washington Post pointed out today if Trump can hold North Carolina the only one of these seven states he won in both 2016 2020 [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=239.84s)]
*  And he takes Georgia and Pennsylvania. That's it. He wins. It's over for Harris [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=246.28s)]
*  Now that path that map is a high-risk high-reward strategy for Republicans. And again [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=250.88s)]
*  The reason we're talking about this specific path is that ad spending we showed you at the top of the block, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=257.92s)]
*  But what's very clear is that Pennsylvania is like just absolutely crucial pivotal for that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=263.36s)]
*  As you might have gathered from Trump's last few rallies there [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=267.8s)]
*  When I'm back in the White House America's future will be built right here in Pennsylvania [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=272.24s)]
*  Pennsylvania is always a big factor. We've had great success as you know politically and otherwise in Pennsylvania the workers of Pennsylvania [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. This is a very [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=284.28s)]
*  consequential vote in Pennsylvania because [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=288.24s)]
*  They say that if you win [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=291.92s)]
*  Pennsylvania, you win [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=294.24s)]
*  If you win Pennsylvania, you're gonna win the whole thing. We cannot let these people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=296.24s)]
*  We cannot let these people win [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=301.2s)]
*  Pennsylvania is almost as crucial for Harris as well. Certainly if she wins there right now she leads in the polls [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=304.76s)]
*  But it's within the margin of error and of course, I think it's fair to say all these states can be very close if she wins there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=309.52s)]
*  She's in good shape. She can also win in some long shot scenarios without Pennsylvania [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  For example, she can hold Georgia and then flip North Carolina, which again a Democrat hasn't won for quite some time [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  But for both campaigns right now, the Keystone state looks like a true Keystone to victory [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=326.24s)]
*  And that's also borne out in the campaign visits this week [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=331.12s)]
*  Harris and President Biden rallied in Pittsburgh on Labor Day for the campaign saying Harris will return there on Thursday [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Harris is running mate Tim Walls is beginning his own solo trip to multiple parts of the state of Pennsylvania [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=340.32s)]
*  Including Lancaster on Wednesday even Doug Emhoff first gentleman is expected to campaign in Allentown, Pennsylvania this week [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=345.72s)]
*  Trump meanwhile is expected in Harrisburg tomorrow to film a town hall with Sean Hannity of Fox News, of course [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=353.18s)]
*  Beyond that he has no major public campaign stop scheduled for this week [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  You [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56SoDt_ft7o&t=383.02s)]
