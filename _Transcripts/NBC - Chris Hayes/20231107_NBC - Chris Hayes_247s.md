# Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky wins re-election, NBC News projects
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA)
*  All right, we just got some big news out of Kentucky. Steve Kornacki is still at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=0.0s)]
*  the big board. Steve, what's the latest? Yeah, our decision desk has now made it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=4.28s)]
*  official and they are comfortable declaring that Andy Beshear, the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=7.88s)]
*  Democratic incumbent governor of Kentucky, has been reelected that he [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=11.32s)]
*  will defeat his Republican challenger, the state the sitting attorney general [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=15.84s)]
*  Daniel Cameron. We've been no surprise if you've been watching all night, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=19.88s)]
*  we've been seeing county after county come in in Kentucky with Beshear running [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=24.22s)]
*  ahead of how he ran in 2019, not by leaps and bounds, but by several points, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=29.8s)]
*  just county after county. The pattern very clear at this point. This is a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=34.88s)]
*  state he won by less than 1.4 years ago. He had a very high approval rating, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=38.36s)]
*  very high personal favorability rating. The Cameron campaign and Republicans [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=43.540000000000006s)]
*  had been hoping to attach Beshear to Joe Biden to the National Democratic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=47.72s)]
*  Party, both of which remain very unpopular in Kentucky. But it looks [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=51.88s)]
*  like that personal popularity in that high job approval rating for Beshear [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=55.72s)]
*  have won out. He is going to get a second term. He's the second Beshear to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=59.48s)]
*  get a second term as governor of Kentucky. His father was a two term [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=64.56s)]
*  governor as well. Not that long ago. Just again, we can show you we got a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=68.72s)]
*  big batch of votes from Louisville, Jefferson County, core Democratic [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=74.0s)]
*  County. We said this would be a big trench of Beshear votes. A few of those [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=77.72s)]
*  came in just a little while ago. You look around the Lexington area and I [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=80.88s)]
*  think you really see it, though. The improvement for Beshear over last time [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=84.2s)]
*  around. He's running six points better in Fayette County, second biggest [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=87.72s)]
*  county in the state than he did four years ago. You look up in Scott County. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=91.08s)]
*  He's running at 55% basically now he was under 54 years ago there. Take a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=95.64s)]
*  look at the state capital Franklin County, where Frankfurt is. He got 61% [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  of the vote here four years ago. He's at 68.5 with almost 95% in. So that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=105.64s)]
*  has been the pattern. These big Democratic vote producing counties. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=110.56s)]
*  He's getting more votes out of in Republican counties. He's still losing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=114.08s)]
*  him, but he's not losing him by as much. It all adds up to what's gonna be a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=118.0s)]
*  victory for Andy Beshear in his second term in the governor's mansion. You [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=121.16s)]
*  know, one of the things in the lead up to the race, there wasn't a ton of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  polling, but to the extent we had polling, we looked at approval ratings. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  This was my understanding and folks in Kentucky politics. The expectation at [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=131.16s)]
*  least was that heading into night Beshear is the favorite that he'd run [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=136.44s)]
*  a pretty good campaign that he was a fairly popular incumbent. Is that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  generally your sense? I would say, yeah, until a week ago, roughly, or a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  little bit less. There was a poll that came out at the end of last week that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=149.08s)]
*  had the race tied up, and there was a second poll that came out yesterday [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=153.16s)]
*  that had it at two points. And there was a thought that it was possible. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=156.96s)]
*  Cameron changed tactics late in this campaign. He'd been running a very sort [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=160.88s)]
*  of aggressive anti Beshear campaign. He's some name calling involved that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=165.36s)]
*  toward the end of the campaign, the Cameron folks shifted tactics, and he [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=171.6s)]
*  put an ad up on the air where he talks to the camera and he says, You know, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  Andy Beshear is not a bad guy. And then he says, But we just have some [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=179.0s)]
*  disagreements. It was a very different tone. And so there was a question when [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=182.56s)]
*  you saw that polling in the final days. If that shift in tone coupled with [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=186.72s)]
*  the antipathy of Kentucky voters towards Biden, towards the National [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=190.48s)]
*  Democratic Party, if that would add up to a late kick here for Cameron that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=193.72s)]
*  would close the gap, it may end up closing the gap to a degree that he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=197.64s)]
*  doesn't lose this thing by what it looked a month ago like he was gonna [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=202.4s)]
*  lose it by. But it certainly wasn't enough to get him over the top. Yeah, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=205.64s)]
*  it's also interesting. They really did. I mean, I saw some of the ads. I saw [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=208.64s)]
*  the campaign spots. There really was a focus on Joe Biden. There really was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=211.56s)]
*  like, Andy Beshear is Joe Biden's buddy. Anybody here in Joe Biden? That was a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=214.84s)]
*  central thrust, which does not appear to have been effective, at least not to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=219.2s)]
*  get him over the humps for victory. Steve Kornacki. Thank you very much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=222.84s)]
*  Mhm. Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=227.6s)]
*  Mhm. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhllhiHgcA&t=230.6s)]
