# ‘We cannot trust him’: Elizabeth Warren sounds off on RFK Jr.
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0)
*  Look, no one should be fooled here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=0.0s)]
*  As Secretary of HHS, Robert Kennedy will have the power to undercut vaccines and vaccine [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=3.2s)]
*  manufacturing across our country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=11.6s)]
*  And for all of his talk about follow the science and his promise that he won't interfere with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=14.36s)]
*  those of us who want to vaccinate his kids, the bottom line is the same. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=20.1s)]
*  Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=25.84s)]
*  Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=32.32s)]
*  Today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had his first confirmation hearing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=36.32s)]
*  Tomorrow, he's got another one, but he's not alone. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=41.0s)]
*  This is gearing up to be a very big week for determining whether or not Donald Trump's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  cabinet gets confirmed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Tomorrow, we're looking at two other hearings that are likely to be contentious. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=48.92s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Cash Patel for director of the FBI. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=52.8s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is on the finance committee that held today's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=59.12s)]
*  hearing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=64.24s)]
*  Senator, it's great to see you again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=65.24s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this evening. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=66.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=67.24s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=68.24s)]
*  A bit like asking about which one is your favorite child. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=69.24s)]
*  What worries you most about Robert F. Kennedy and the views he has should he become the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=71.2s)]
*  Health and Human Services Secretary? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=75.96s)]
*  You know, it's right where the little clip was that you did. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=78.08s)]
*  To understand this, if he's put in charge of Health and Human Services, he has a whole [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=81.44s)]
*  toolbox of ways that he very quietly can undermine vaccines and vaccine manufacturers, and he [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=87.84s)]
*  can get rich doing it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=97.24s)]
*  If he does that, he can stand there, smile at you and say, no, no, he's fine. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=99.12s)]
*  Anybody can vaccinate the kids that they want to. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=104.0s)]
*  But he literally could bankrupt the vaccine manufacturers with the power he will have. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=107.32s)]
*  And since he's got a financial incentive to do that, we cannot trust him in that job. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=113.44s)]
*  We talked about this a little bit in my last segment about what happened in American Samoa. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=119.24s)]
*  The idea that he sort of cashed in and kids did die. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=123.32s)]
*  You don't have to be a scientist to understand the relationship between these things. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=129.92s)]
*  This is a really worrisome issue. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=134.2s)]
*  This isn't even the same as everybody getting vaccinated for COVID. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=135.76s)]
*  Not vaccinating kids for provably diseases that you can vaccinate them against getting. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  Even by a couple of percent changes the entire game. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=146.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=148.64s)]
*  Understand this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=149.64s)]
*  What Robert Kennedy did when he came into Samoa, there was already a problem. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=150.92s)]
*  There had been malpractice and a vaccine had been mixed with another drug and two children [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=155.28s)]
*  had died. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=161.38s)]
*  And obviously, Robert Kennedy had nothing to do with that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=162.44s)]
*  Vaccinations were dropping. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=165.44s)]
*  Kennedy comes to town and he meets with the prime minister. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=167.88s)]
*  They talk about vaccines. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=171.2s)]
*  He meets with the anti-vax group. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  They say it was transformative and vaccinations keep going down. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=175.44s)]
*  And then we know exactly what happens. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=180.64s)]
*  Vaccinations go down, a measles outbreak hits, and then kids start dying. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=183.44s)]
*  And here's the deal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=188.64s)]
*  They start dying. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=189.92s)]
*  The prime minister declares a national emergency and Robert Kennedy doubles down. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=191.12s)]
*  He sends a letter after 16 kids have died within four days of declaring this national [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=198.56s)]
*  emergency and says, you know, it probably isn't the vaccine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=203.82s)]
*  Maybe isn't the vaccine, I mean, the measles outbreak. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=208.8s)]
*  Maybe the problem here is that vaccine itself is so dangerous. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=212.88s)]
*  And then he comes back and the outfit that he has put together keeps spreading that lie. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=219.12s)]
*  So much so that the World Health Organization gets engaged, looks at all the science and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  bats it back. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=232.52s)]
*  They say there's just no foundation for what he's saying. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=233.52s)]
*  And yet what it does is it not only, more than 70 kids died in Samoa, 70 people died [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=237.28s)]
*  in Samoa. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=245.84s)]
*  It's also what it does around the world because it gave fuel to the anti-vax. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=248.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=255.0s)]
*  All those people died in Samoa and the problem was not the failure to vaccinate. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=256.4s)]
*  They're promoting the idea that the problem was the vaccine itself. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=262.96s)]
*  And that backs people off from vaccinating at all. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=266.6s)]
*  And that fits in to his, he gets paid for these lawsuits against these vaccine manufacturers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  And those guys operate on really thin margins. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=279.76s)]
*  So you keep suing those guys and he has reason to do that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=283.17999999999995s)]
*  He's able to rake in money on that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  And that means potentially those vaccine manufacturers just say, we're not doing vaccines. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=291.28s)]
*  And that means then you can't vaccinate your kids. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=297.1s)]
*  I can't see that my grandkids get vaccinated. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=300.26000000000005s)]
*  And that's a problem for all of us. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=303.36s)]
*  So we heard the testimony. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=305.02000000000004s)]
*  We heard all of you senators say, we've got the tape. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=307.06s)]
*  We've got the transcript. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  We've got the podcast. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  We know all of that exists. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  But he doesn't seem particularly imperiled in terms of having this nomination be approved. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=314.16s)]
*  No. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=319.94s)]
*  And you know, that's what's happening here over and over with these nominees. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=320.94s)]
*  We did this with Secretary of Defense. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=327.06s)]
*  We're now doing this with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, really demonstrating [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=329.1s)]
*  in a very public way, not just how unqualified these people are, but how disqualified these [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=334.18s)]
*  people are for these public offices that they've been nominated to. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=342.24s)]
*  Any other time, the Republicans would have been the first to lead the charge against [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=348.02s)]
*  these folks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=354.46s)]
*  But instead, they may squirm. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=355.94s)]
*  They may look uncomfortable. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=358.0s)]
*  But so far, their loyalty to Donald Trump is ahead of their loyalty to the American [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=360.18s)]
*  people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=365.58s)]
*  I want to ask you, because it's an area that you're very involved in, yesterday in response [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=366.58s)]
*  to the Trump administration, very confusing memo, freezing federal funds that had already [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=369.9s)]
*  been appropriated by Congress. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=374.78s)]
*  You posted, we do not consent to this lawless power grab. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=376.28s)]
*  Today, as we've reported, the administration rescinded the memo, but the executive orders [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=380.06s)]
*  remain in place that include the freezing of all foreign aid, all funds to federal grantees [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=385.18s)]
*  who receive money for any DEI-related purposes, all money appropriated through the Inflation [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=390.66s)]
*  Reduction Act. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=395.42s)]
*  What's your take on this? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=396.42s)]
*  I just want to remind everyone what this is really about. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=398.3s)]
*  This is about the preschools that get a little federal funding calling us and saying, can [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=402.82s)]
*  we still open tomorrow, or would that be a violation of this edict from Donald Trump? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=409.74s)]
*  This is about one of my places out in Western Mass that works with homeless vets. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=416.26s)]
*  They genuinely want to know, can they feed those vets tonight, and how are they going [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=423.0s)]
*  to pay the rent in three days? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=428.26s)]
*  Another place that we've got that works with severely disabled adults and provides care [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  all day long for them and a place for them to be, their portal is shut down because they [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  get some federal funding. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=443.44s)]
*  So we're talking about real effects on people all over this country. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  If it's not you directly, it's your friends, it's your neighbors, it's little kids, it's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=452.0s)]
*  seniors in nursing homes, all of whom are told that if you're getting federal funding, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  we're just going to take it away from you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=464.12s)]
*  That is not only lawless, it is cruel. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=467.52s)]
*  The amount of pain and dislocation for these people over the last 24 hours has truly been [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  something awful, just even to live through secondhand. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=480.5s)]
*  So Donald Trump and his team are still out there scrambling because they've discovered [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=484.92s)]
*  the American people really don't like this and are pushing back. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=490.12s)]
*  And the Democrats in Congress, we're trying to push back right alongside them and say, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=494.52s)]
*  we're going to hold Donald Trump accountable. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=499.36s)]
*  He has to follow the law and he's got to follow through on what we have already passed. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSLGs6m8j0&t=501.4s)]
