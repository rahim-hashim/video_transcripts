# What the DeSantis campaign cost 87,000 lives, $150 million and Ron's dignity
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0)
*  I'm not a candidate, so we'll see if and when that changes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=0.0s)]
*  And I say, yeah, that's probably a lot of sugar, huh? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=5.12s)]
*  And people acquired skills in spite of slavery, not because of it, and then they use those [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=8.4s)]
*  when they achieve their freedom. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=13.8s)]
*  Within 10 minutes of me being in the city, I see some guy relieving himself on the sidewalk [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=16.06s)]
*  with number two. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Do you remember Ron DeSantis? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=25.68s)]
*  That name ring a bell? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  If Republican primary voters do, the memories are not particularly fond ones. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=28.72s)]
*  He is currently pulling in a whopping 6% of primary voters in New Hampshire polls. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=32.36s)]
*  Numbers so low, he skipped the state and went straight to South Carolina, where he has a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=37.4s)]
*  much more robust 7%. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=40.56s)]
*  It has gotten so bad that after his second place finish in Iowa, the top DeSantis super [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=42.56s)]
*  pack named, somewhat ironically, Never Back Down, laid off much of its staff in some big [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=47.9s)]
*  states. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=53.0s)]
*  Hard to believe now, but there was a time this was the far-right Florida governor's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=54.0s)]
*  race to lose. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=57.94s)]
*  A year ago, he was even beating Donald Trump head to head by double digits in the polls, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=58.94s)]
*  a huge lead to go with a huge campaign chest, $150 million raised by last summer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  The problem was that the more people heard Ron DeSantis and saw Ron DeSantis and interacted [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=69.42s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, the less they liked him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=74.5s)]
*  Even Nikki Haley won't debate him now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=78.1s)]
*  He ran a truly terrible campaign. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=80.34s)]
*  He squandered those millions. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=81.78s)]
*  I have to point out that worse than that, there is, I think, plausibly an actual death [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=84.02s)]
*  toll associated with the DeSantis campaign for president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=89.34s)]
*  One of his key plans in this race was to be Trumpier than Donald Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=93.22s)]
*  And a big part of that strategy was running to Trump's right on the COVID pandemic measures, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=97.18s)]
*  which included trashing the vaccines, the Trump vaccines, and he is still doing it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=102.06s)]
*  They lied to us about the COVID shots. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=109.06s)]
*  Remember, they said if you take a COVID shot, you will not get COVID. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=111.34s)]
*  How true was that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, every booster you take, you're more likely to get COVID as a result of it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=122.94s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=124.42s)]
*  That's false. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  Dangerously false. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=127.62s)]
*  But that's who DeSantis is. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=129.62s)]
*  He also yelled at kids for wearing masks in a pandemic and he hired a state surgeon general [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=131.46s)]
*  who spread complete, like, totally nutty lies that the MRA vaccine would infiltrate your [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=136.42s)]
*  DNA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=142.38s)]
*  And it all had a tangible effect on the health of residents in America's third biggest state. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=144.54s)]
*  Look at this chart. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  It shows the very first COVID wave that hit after the vaccine became available and after [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=148.98s)]
*  DeSantis started bashing the vaccines. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=153.1s)]
*  As Florida vaccination rates flagged, its death rate and Delta wave topped out at nearly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  three times the rest of America. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=160.66s)]
*  87,000 Floridians have died of COVID on DeSantis' watch, according to the New York Times. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=163.14s)]
*  For what? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  Six percent of New Hampshire Republican votes? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  It's easy to laugh at DeSantis and his terrible presidential campaign, but it cost more than [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  $150 million and his dignity, and it also cost actual lives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=174.98s)]
*  Joining me now is David Jelle, former Republican congressman of Florida who served alongside [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=180.33999999999997s)]
*  Ron DeSantis in the House. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=183.82s)]
*  Every once in a while, I'm reminded the guy's still governor of the third largest state, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=185.26s)]
*  presumably with a day job he should be attending to. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=189.06s)]
*  And the Surgeon General is still the Surgeon General saying just utterly, like recklessly [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=192.06s)]
*  dangerous insidious nutty stuff about the COVID vaccines. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=198.02s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, perhaps the best part of Ron DeSantis' year on the campaign trail is it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=202.02s)]
*  kept him out of the state of Florida and he did less harm here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=206.78s)]
*  As you identified, Ron DeSantis, a uniquely unlikable politician, and I think the words [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  of the Book of Proverbs have rarely been more prescient than pride goeth before a fall because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=215.78s)]
*  this is a governor whose first ad said that on the eighth day, God created Ron DeSantis. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=221.38000000000002s)]
*  And now he's simply in this race running to be the last one to drop out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=226.78s)]
*  And so how did we get there? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  Look, he had a 19-point win in his reelection in the state of Florida, a historic win. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=232.34s)]
*  He did it, as you mentioned, based on the politics of COVID, on culture wars, and on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=238.02s)]
*  a weakened Florida Democratic Party. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  And none of those key elements of his reelection were actually translatable to a presidential [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  campaign. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=250.74s)]
*  And he also had the vanity that came with being a very powerful governor, the most powerful [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  we've seen in a couple of decades. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=256.06s)]
*  Mix in with that the raw ambition of his partner on the trail, his spouse. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=258.26s)]
*  And you see a candidate who thought he was going to step in this race and replace Donald [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=262.5s)]
*  Trump, but he miscalculated that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=266.74s)]
*  He thought that the party would get past Donald Trump. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=268.7s)]
*  He thought the Department of Justice would sink Donald Trump, or he thought he could [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  engage in a delegate slog. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=275.62s)]
*  And none of those strategies have worked. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=277.94s)]
*  And so now it is kind of a political death watch. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  I don't know that he leaves after New Hampshire. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=282.94s)]
*  I wonder if both Haley and DeSantis drop out on the night of South Carolina. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  But either way, he's on his way out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  One of the reasons I want to talk to you tonight is because you've known DeSantis for a while. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, you've been you were active. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=295.86s)]
*  You were Republican congressman for in Florida. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=297.26s)]
*  You've been active in politics in the state. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=299.74s)]
*  You know him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=302.5s)]
*  And you very early on. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=303.94s)]
*  In fact, we did a live show down in Miami. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=306.98s)]
*  You were like, this guy is not very likable and not very good campaigning. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=309.94s)]
*  And I don't think this is going to sell. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=314.42s)]
*  And you said it very early on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=316.02s)]
*  And I do wonder how much there were strategic miscalculations, which they were, or just [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=317.74s)]
*  ultimately just this guy just doesn't have the appeal to do it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=321.94s)]
*  Yeah, look, some people are uniquely bad at retail politics. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=327.02s)]
*  He is. We know that maybe he has other strengths, but it's that raw combination of arrogance [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  and anger. And it's both are very powerful. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=335.38s)]
*  Right. I mean, if you consider his culture wars within his culture wars is his personal [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=339.06s)]
*  ethos that he knows best how you should raise your kids and what your family should believe. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=343.58s)]
*  His attacks on the migrant community is an attack on diversity. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=348.58s)]
*  His attack on voting rights is an attack on empowering communities of color to exercise [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=351.98s)]
*  their franchise and participate in democracy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=356.58s)]
*  His attack on education in the LGBT community is an attack on the independence of parenting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  that my wife and I would like to be in charge of for our children. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=364.38s)]
*  And so if he took culture wars too far, I think it's in that vein. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=367.7s)]
*  I think he chose culture wars because it was a way to run adjacent to Donald Trump in a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=372.1s)]
*  space that Trump didn't own. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=376.78s)]
*  But it didn't work and it backfired on him. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=378.46s)]
*  And I think it's good for the country that it did. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think, again, there's it's very easy for candidates to confuse preference [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=382.54s)]
*  with intensity in politics, which is you run a poll and they say, look, Republican Party [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=389.02s)]
*  voters agree with you on health care for trans youth. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=393.14s)]
*  And they do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=397.74s)]
*  Republican Party voters do agree with Ron DeSantis on that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=398.74s)]
*  I think they're wrong. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=400.82s)]
*  But also, if like that's what you're obsessed with, you come off like a weirdo, even to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=402.38s)]
*  Republican primary voters. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=405.9s)]
*  And we've I mean, real honestly, like this stuff, I think that the sort of the obsessiveness [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=407.58s)]
*  and the narrowness of that focus really did end up end up costing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=413.94s)]
*  Hey, Chris, look, the the the trans issue is a relatively new one for our culture. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=419.3s)]
*  And you can see the good faith actors trying to achieve equity and you see the bad faith [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56CYEb_Y3b0&t=424.3s)]
