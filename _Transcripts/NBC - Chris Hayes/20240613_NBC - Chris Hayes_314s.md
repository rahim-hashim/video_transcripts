# Trump just proposed ‘one of the most deranged policies’ all of time, says Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko)
*  President Joe Biden is in Italy today meeting with the world leaders for the 50th G7 summit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=0.0s)]
*  This morning the group posed for the classic family photo. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=5.68s)]
*  Now this version of that picture, edited by political scientist Ian Bremmer, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=8.88s)]
*  reveals something very important about the leaders of the world's biggest economies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=13.84s)]
*  They are all really unpopular. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=17.52s)]
*  Those numbers above their heads are their net disapproval ratings, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=20.32s)]
*  with Joe Biden actually coming in second, underwater by only 18.5 points. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=23.36s)]
*  And there is one big reason why these leaders are all so unpopular. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  All of the G7 nations and most of the world have faced levels of inflation not seen for decades. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=33.44s)]
*  Of course, none of the leaders are directly responsible for that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  As you can see, the jump inflation coincided with the end of the pandemic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=42.96s)]
*  It was a result of an enormous surge in pent-up demand amidst a pandemic-induced constraint on supply. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=47.36s)]
*  But voters, totally understandably and rationally, hate inflation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=55.04s)]
*  It's been three or four years of prices going up and up, and they blame the incumbent party. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=59.52s)]
*  Here in the US, the consumer price index, a measurement of inflation, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=64.72s)]
*  hit a whopping 9% in the summer of 2022. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=68.64s)]
*  And we've actually recovered relatively well since then, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=71.76s)]
*  better than many of our G7 counterparts. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=74.56s)]
*  The index dropped down to 3.3% as of yesterday's report. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  Now that, of course, crucially is the rate of increase, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=81.76s)]
*  Prices are going up at a slower rate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Cumulatively, prices are still way up here and everywhere. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  But the truth is that Joe Biden didn't really have a lot to do with the fact this line went up, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=91.76s)]
*  or that it went down. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=97.12s)]
*  That's mostly circumstances outside his control, the Fed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=99.44s)]
*  Now, I will say this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden's administration has tried very hard to cut costs for Americans wherever they can, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  taking steps to lower prescription drug costs, canceling student debt, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  getting rid of all kinds of junk fees at airlines and banks, for example. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=113.92s)]
*  But for the most part, being real here, the rise in fall inflation was a result of external factors [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=118.0s)]
*  like the pandemic and the decisions of the Federal Reserve outside of President Biden's control. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=123.68s)]
*  And so voters might look at that and say, well, then, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=128.08s)]
*  why does it really matter who the next president is? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=131.44s)]
*  It's sort of coming down on its own. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=133.36s)]
*  It matters because Donald Trump is running on the most explicitly inflationary platform [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=136.24s)]
*  in modern history. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=142.8s)]
*  I think we should have a ring around the collar, as they say. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  I think when companies come in and they dump their products in the United States, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=148.16s)]
*  they should pay automatically, let's say, a 10 percent tax. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  I do like the 10 percent for everybody. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=156.16s)]
*  Trump's proposal, a 10 percent across-the-board tariff on all foreign goods, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=159.44s)]
*  would be basically a sales tax. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=163.84s)]
*  It would raise prices for American consumers, 10 percent on everything from avocados to iPhones. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=165.52s)]
*  Now, if you think that's bad, today, behind closed doors, outside of the view of cameras, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=170.88s)]
*  Donald Trump proposed one of the most deranged policies I have ever heard. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=177.6s)]
*  He told Republican lawmakers behind closed doors he wants to eliminate the income tax [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=183.28s)]
*  and replace it entirely with tariffs, effectively taking us back to the 19th century. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=188.48s)]
*  This idea makes as much sense as ripping up the entire interstate highway system [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=194.72s)]
*  and replacing it with canals. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  Economist Paul Krugman did some back-of-the-envelope math, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=202.0s)]
*  estimates the policy, quote, would require an average tariff of 133 percent. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=204.72s)]
*  Not 10 percent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=211.44s)]
*  That is a 133 percent tax hike on all imported goods. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=212.24s)]
*  That would be passed on to consumers, a sales tax of 133 percent. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=217.68s)]
*  It would cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=221.44s)]
*  Former senior policy advisor to the National Economic Council, Brendan Duke, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=224.96s)]
*  explained further, quote, another way to put Trump's latest incredibly unworkable idea, one, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=229.36s)]
*  get this, it would raise taxes by $5,000 for a typical family, if you're a working person, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=235.6s)]
*  who buys stuff. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=241.6s)]
*  It would cut taxes for the average family in the top 0.1 percent by $1.5 million. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=242.88s)]
*  This proposal would jack up everything, everywhere, for normal people, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=252.32s)]
*  crushing the average American's wallet while giving the wealthiest folks who are no [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=257.92s)]
*  longer have to pay an income tax and don't buy that much relative to their income, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=261.92s)]
*  an enormous windfall, millions and millions of dollars. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=265.2s)]
*  This is the man who has a 50-50 shot at taking the White House, in large part because of the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=268.72s)]
*  macroeconomic conditions that produced high inflation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=273.36s)]
*  And he is seriously, quite seriously and earnestly, currently running on the most [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=276.48s)]
*  insanely inflationary platform I've ever seen. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  Higher prices, higher taxes for everyone. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  It would make what we've seen over the last few years look like nothing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ounq1Z3wnko&t=286.72s)]
