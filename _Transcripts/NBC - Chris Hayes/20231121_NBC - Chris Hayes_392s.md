# Hostage deal approved by Israeli government
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI)
*  There's this very late night convening of the cabinet to assess the deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=0.0s)]
*  Do we know anything about what is happening? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=4.88s)]
*  Yeah, good night from here Chris. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=10.56s)]
*  We know that minutes ago the Israeli government did vote to pass the deal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=13.52s)]
*  It was not unanimous and Netanyahu's most extreme right ministers, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  including I think one or two from his own party, did not support it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=25.84s)]
*  But out of the 38 minister government this passed comfortably. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=30.16s)]
*  There are expected to be very limited appeals to the Supreme Court presented even tonight, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=35.28s)]
*  right now, 3, 4 in the morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=42.56s)]
*  And those appeals would be against specific names of Palestinian prisoners [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=44.96s)]
*  who are going to be published in the coming minutes, those that will be exchanged. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=50.56s)]
*  And family members of the victims of those people have the right to appeal specific names. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Ironically, the right-wing organizations who were hoping to appeal against this whole decision [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=61.76s)]
*  and say that it was illegitimate are limited from doing it by a law that Netanyahu himself [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=67.28s)]
*  passed pre-war when he was trying to do a judicial overhaul. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=72.96s)]
*  Yes, this is the Times reporting on this, on the possible Palestinian prisoners who might be [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=78.32s)]
*  included in such a deal, saying that negotiations around the release of Israeli women and children [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=83.84s)]
*  held hostage in Gaza have centered on exchange for Palestinian women and minors held in Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=89.04s)]
*  prisons. Many of the most recent arrests came during raids across the Israeli-occupied West [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Bank where protests and violence have surged, including attacks on Palestinians by Israeli [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=97.76s)]
*  settlers. Israel has said the arrests are part of a counterterrorism operation against Hamas [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=101.76s)]
*  and the West Bank. Rights groups have long warned that Palestinian detainees are held without due [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=106.16s)]
*  process and face abuse and even torture. So these would be these prisoners who are part of this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=110.56s)]
*  exchange, it sounds like will mostly be women and children themselves. Is there any additional [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  reporting about the pause aspect of this, about there being some cessation of hostilities for some [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=123.04s)]
*  period of time? There is, and as you said, we should underline how complicated it is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=130.32s)]
*  The understanding that I have here is that the initial batch of Israeli hostages to be released [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=137.52s)]
*  counts, as you said, about 50, but they're not going to be released all on Thursday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=144.24s)]
*  They're going to be released at about the pace of 10 a day over four or five days. And what Hamas [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=149.44s)]
*  is promising is that if Israel then extends the pause, it will search for more children, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=156.8s)]
*  in particular. Search for more. Israel has about 240 hostages, so the release of 50 [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=163.76s)]
*  would still leave 190 Israelis or, I want to emphasize this, foreigners captured in Israel, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  tourists, agricultural workers, aid workers, you name it. These people are not being counted. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=178.48s)]
*  Israel has explicitly said any non-Israeli citizens are not counted in exchange for the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=185.84s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners. But these are all counted as Israeli hostages taken from Israeli territory. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=191.44s)]
*  So I think that if the deal goes ahead and it proceeds well, what we're seeing is at least five [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=198.16s)]
*  days of a truce that I think will include also the cessation of Israeli spy drone activities over Gaza, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  which leads to a lot of questions about what Hamas is planning to do during that time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=215.36s)]
*  And that then Hamas plans to kind of dangle this possibility of further hostage releases [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  over several days, ideally for it to try and change this truce into a permanent ceasefire. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=230.48s)]
*  Let me just say that we can now, you just said this, so I'm not telling the viewers anything [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  they don't know, but NBC News now confirming and reporting that the Israeli cabinet has, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=241.92s)]
*  as Noga was just saying, passed the 38 ministers have by majority approved this deal. Again, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=246.4s)]
*  the contours of the deal are not public or written down anywhere, so we're still sort of figuring [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=254.56s)]
*  this out based on reporting. But the deal has been approved. It was not unanimous. There was [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=259.76s)]
*  opposition, as Noga said, some of the more far-right members of that government, including some members, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=263.68s)]
*  Netanyahu's Likud party as well. The prime minister's office, the Israeli government meeting, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=269.76s)]
*  has just ended. This is the prime minister's office. The decision on the outline of the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=275.12s)]
*  hostage deal passed by a majority of votes. That's what we have. So we have approval, it seems. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=278.64s)]
*  We have our understanding of the basic contours of this and particularly about this sort of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=284.88s)]
*  attenuated release of hostages in exchange for cessation of hostilities as well. I guess my final [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=289.92s)]
*  question for you is like, what the sort of political discourse around this in Israel has [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=296.16s)]
*  been like? Obviously, I think I can imagine right now family members of the hostages [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=302.0s)]
*  in this just unbelievably intense and difficult period right now of wondering, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=308.08s)]
*  is their loved one going to be one of the ones? That's right. I mean, the word for this is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=315.76s)]
*  heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. There have been aspects that have been disgraceful with [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=321.76s)]
*  some of Netanyahu's ministers attacking these families, screaming at them, you don't have a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=326.72s)]
*  monopoly on pain and this sort of thing. And I have to tell you that what, again, assuming this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=330.96s)]
*  deal goes through, as you said, assuming it proceeds smoothly, what we're talking about is [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=336.4s)]
*  the Israeli government within very few days finding itself in a squeeze organized by Hamas [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=340.96s)]
*  in which either it suspends military operations for longer or it has to look at close to 100 [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  Israeli families in the face and say, yeah, your loved ones are still in Gaza and we're starting [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  to bomb again. All right, no good, Tarnopolski. It's always fantastic to get your perspective. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=359.36s)]
*  I really appreciate you staying up till this ungodly hour to bring us this news [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=365.04s)]
*  live here. It's really appreciated. Thank you very much. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=369.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0IuQ-T-TI&t=389.36s)]
