# ‘Different reality’: Pro-Trump farmers react to Trump trade war
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80)
*  Despite Donald Trump blinking on a bunch of the big disastrous tariffs on the whole world, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=0.0s)]
*  including Madagascar and the island with the penguins, he announced today he's not just [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  maintaining but increasing his tariffs on China, which is one of our largest trading [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  partners. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=13.44s)]
*  And among the Americans who will almost immediately feel the pain are farmers, because China buys [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=14.64s)]
*  a lot of their product and will slap tariffs on in response. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=19.68s)]
*  Alex Wagner has been doing amazing reporting on the impact of Trump's policies on the ground, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=23.64s)]
*  and we went to North Carolina to talk to former farmers about Trump's tariffs and what it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=28.16s)]
*  means for their future and their livelihood. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=32.08s)]
*  Agriculture, there's about 85% of what happens on my farm that is completely out of my control. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=35.04s)]
*  So I have to do the very best I can at managing that 15% of inputs and costs and labor and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=46.64s)]
*  marketing and signing the best contract and doing the best job that I can and leave the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=52.84s)]
*  other 85% up to the good Lord. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=58.36000000000001s)]
*  And that's all we can do, whether it's weather or disease or a hail storm or a pandemic or [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=60.28s)]
*  an administration, and we just weather the storm. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=66.16s)]
*  It's kind of a wait and see game. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  I think the main thing is it's not to overreact and get too nervous. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  Stay the course. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=76.12s)]
*  That's what's helped us, you know, all of these generations of farmers stay in the course [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=77.12s)]
*  and doing what we do best and being efficient, not spending money when we don't need to spend [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=82.0s)]
*  money and just keeping our ears open and eyes open and being able to pivot when we can. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=87.2s)]
*  Here with me now is Alex Wagner, MSNBC Senior Political Analyst and host of the Trump Plan [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=94.88s)]
*  podcast. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  I loved those quotes because I think it's actually a profound insight, like a genuinely profound [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=100.4s)]
*  insight and also like explains a lot of why a lot of folks are like, yes, you know, we're just [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=105.52s)]
*  going to sort of see where it all goes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=112.32s)]
*  I think, you know, it was interesting being in Clayton, North Carolina yesterday as, you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  know, Wall Street's melting down. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=117.6s)]
*  The financial world is flipping out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=119.84s)]
*  Investors are calling Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=121.68s)]
*  People can't get through. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=122.8s)]
*  It's a different reality in red state America. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=124.24s)]
*  All the people that I talked to at that table had voted for Trump at least once, if not [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=126.88s)]
*  multiple times. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=131.04s)]
*  And in part because of that, but I think largely because of the attitude you have to take when [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=132.16s)]
*  you are a farmer, you are more sanguine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=138.0s)]
*  You are more accepting of external chaos. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=140.48s)]
*  But I kept saying this isn't hurricanes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=143.28s)]
*  This isn't weather. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  This isn't an act of God. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=146.32s)]
*  This is Donald Trump making very clear decisions that put you in financial peril. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  And it's not just that they sell their goods to China. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=151.44s)]
*  It's that they need farm equipment. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=154.56s)]
*  They need lots of supplies that are manufactured in China. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=156.0s)]
*  And they've already spent that money, Chris. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=159.52s)]
*  The way it goes with a commodities trade is you've already put the money in the ground [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=161.68s)]
*  for the seed, the fertilizer, the equipment, the labor. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=165.44s)]
*  They just got to hope come harvest time that they can sell it at a decent price and don't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=167.76s)]
*  lose money. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=172.64s)]
*  And Trump has thrown all of that up in the air, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=173.04s)]
*  But what's so interesting, I think, is the empathy they feel with him in so far as the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  project of correcting a trade imbalance that they see has been decades in the making, the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=180.96s)]
*  kinship they feel with him in his political project to break things and upend the status [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=185.92s)]
*  quo, and the fundamental and unspoken belief that if it all does go to hell in a handbag, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=189.92s)]
*  as it did in 2018, Donald Trump will make sure they are made whole. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=195.6s)]
*  So I'm speaking of the bailouts that were offered, bailouts, the assistance that was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=200.64s)]
*  granted to farmers in the last Trump trade war with China in 2018. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  And I asked them about that and whether that was something they expected and what they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=209.27999999999997s)]
*  thought of other people who might not be so keen on that idea. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=213.52s)]
*  This is that conversation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=216.0s)]
*  The assistance that the president put in place after the last tariff increase basically erased [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  the financial gains from that tariff increase, which I think left a lot of people scratching [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=224.8s)]
*  their heads like, well, why are we doing this to begin with? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=229.28s)]
*  Do you feel the same way? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  I feel like in the last trade war, we kind of went through the short-term pain and I'm [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  wondering where the gain was, maybe we kind of came out of it in a little bit of turmoil. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=237.28s)]
*  I think some people have not forgotten that and they're saying, well, you know what? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=241.92s)]
*  The people that voted to put this president in office, this is your guy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=245.6s)]
*  And if this is your guy, you got to roll with the policies he enacts. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=248.88s)]
*  And like, why should the rest of the country that didn't vote for him be bailing out farmers? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=252.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=257.36s)]
*  And they're also those same people oftentimes demand that farmers address climate change and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=258.0s)]
*  farmers adapt different technologies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=263.2s)]
*  And we have responded in spades with soil health initiatives, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=265.12s)]
*  cover crops, using less inputs to produce more on less land with less water and higher labor [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=268.8s)]
*  costs. But those same people that make those demands are not willing to pay the cost for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  the American products in the store. They will buy the cheaper imported products that have much [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=279.2s)]
*  lower, their daily wage rate are less than what we have to pay an hour for our H2A workers that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=284.48s)]
*  are coming in. And the disparity when you're having somebody tell you how to do what you do [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=289.92s)]
*  best for a living and then not be willing to pay for the demands that they're making is laughable. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=296.48s)]
*  We're fighting with one hand tied behind our backs because we're having to meet the regulations [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=302.24s)]
*  that are imposed to produce the quality food and address all of these other social issues we may [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=306.0s)]
*  or may not be responsible for. But at the same time, we're not seeing a return in the marketplace [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=311.84s)]
*  because American products are too expensive. And that's the tragedy of the American farmer [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=317.52s)]
*  is we produce the best and we meet the demands and we step up to the plate. But the consumer, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=323.68s)]
*  when they go to the store, they're looking for the best deal and the best value. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=328.96s)]
*  The system that they had to take issue with is the broad, sort of the broader landscape for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=334.0s)]
*  American farming in a global economy. And it's, I think because of this long stand, again, decades [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=338.64s)]
*  long feeling of inequity, that they'll basically go along with whatever Trump is trying to do to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  correct that imbalance. And anybody who stands in the way of that or says farmers don't get their [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=353.04s)]
*  due doesn't understand how difficult it is to be a farmer in America. I mean, what's so interesting [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=357.12s)]
*  about that quote, I really think that guy's a really well-spoken and interesting fellow, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=360.88s)]
*  is that the fundamental reality here is that one person's cost is another person's income. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=366.48s)]
*  Yes. Always. Yep. This is Econ 101 and it's lost in so much of the debate here. So when he says- [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=372.48s)]
*  Cost of labor. When people talk about costs going up, it's like when you talk about like, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=378.8s)]
*  housing costs are high. It's like, that's bad. But if you say home values are rising, it's like, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  well, that's good. And that depends on whether you want to get into a housing market or you own a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=386.24s)]
*  house. If you say the cost of the corn we're growing is going up, well, that's good if you're [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=390.16s)]
*  a farmer, but it's not good if you're the consumer. Right? And they talked a lot about wage requirements [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=395.36s)]
*  and labor costs. And I think the issue they take is unlike housing, it's not two by side by side [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  apartments, one built by, it's not an apartment building that's been imported from China. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  Next to an apartment building in New York City, it's, they are competing in the global marketplace. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  But what's so- In a way that other commodities aren't. Totally. But what's so crazy about this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=417.6s)]
*  whole thing is we just had this whole election where everyone's consensus view, and I was there, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=420.88000000000005s)]
*  I didn't lose my mind, was like, prices are too high. And I asked them that. And now we've come [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  out of it and it's like, Americans, we got to get over this obsession with cheap stuff. It's like, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=429.04s)]
*  we just did this. I was there every goddamn night. And they are farmers who are also consumers [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  themselves. They are going to be affected both in their livelihood and just as parents and people [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=440.24s)]
*  trying to put food on the table. And yet, Chris, I am telling you, Donald Trump has not lost them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=444.08s)]
*  No, of course not. And again, I don't- Look, the way all this stuff works is, you could go find a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=448.88s)]
*  rich Democrat who a Democrat's going to raise taxes on and they're not going to leave the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=454.72s)]
*  Democratic party. They believe in things other than that. But this thing about the cost is really [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=457.92s)]
*  driving me insane because all of a sudden it's like, we're all having this good faith conversation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=462.64s)]
*  about maybe the world of cheap foreign imports isn't the best thing for America. It's like, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=466.4s)]
*  well, yeah, maybe. But what were we just doing last year when all we talked about is how everything [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  is expensive? Suddenly the center of gravity of the conversation has shifted in a remarkable way. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=476.4s)]
*  I'm very excited to listen to this episode of Trump Plan. It's a good one, I gotta say. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=481.67999999999995s)]
*  Now, yeah, that was really great. Really, really, really great work. Alex Wagner, thank you. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=485.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhwWrTKk80&t=496.4s)]
