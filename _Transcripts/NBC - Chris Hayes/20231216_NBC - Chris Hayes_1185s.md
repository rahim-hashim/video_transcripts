# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Dec. 15
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM)
*  So, as we just reported, Rudy Giuliani has been ordered to pay two Georgia election workers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=0.0s)]
*  nearly $150 million after a court found him liable for defaming them as he spread Donald [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Trump's big lie. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=11.52s)]
*  And what really sunk Rudy here, apart from his, well, obvious guilt, was his refusal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=13.0s)]
*  to publicly acknowledge what he did or apologize for his obvious and cruel wrongdoing, which [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=17.6s)]
*  of course is in keeping with the MAGA ethos. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=23.0s)]
*  But public apologies for January 6th and the big lie are actually really important for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=26.28s)]
*  the country's political health. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=30.16s)]
*  Tens of millions of people still believe Trump won in 2020. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=32.08s)]
*  He is currently running on that platform, basically, to finish the job he started on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=40.52s)]
*  And it's crucial that those responsible for the attempted coup are held accountable for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  their behavior and ideally state plainly and clearly, publicly, that the election was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=45.92s)]
*  not stolen and what they did to try to overturn it was wrong. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=51.96s)]
*  On the lowest rungs of the ladder, we often see this with the members of the insurrectionist [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=57.52s)]
*  mob who were later charged. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=61.08s)]
*  There's been dozens, hundreds of them, like a man named Daniel Caldwell, one example. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  He's a former Marine who pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement officers with a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=67.88s)]
*  dangerous weapon after he used chemical spray against police officers on January 6th. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=71.88s)]
*  During a tearful apology in court, Caldwell said, quote, I must face my actions head on, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=78.0s)]
*  according to the officers he assaulted. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=82.88s)]
*  Quote, I hope that you and your country never have to face another day like January 6th. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=85.12s)]
*  And even when it comes to coup plotters higher up in the scheme, like the defendants in Trump's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=92.64s)]
*  Georgia racketeering case, we have seen some seemingly genuine contrition. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=97.64s)]
*  If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=103.76s)]
*  post-election challenges. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=108.28s)]
*  I look back on this whole experience with deep remorse. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  It was Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis during her guilty plea earlier this year. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  There's also a bail bondsman named Scott Hall, who was part of the election interference [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=117.28s)]
*  scheme that helped break into a voting machine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  He wrote a letter to the judge where he apologized for his role in the plot and he took responsibility [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  for his actions. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=129.16s)]
*  But the other two Trump Confederates who pleaded guilty were not so contrite. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=131.32s)]
*  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution received each of their letters to the judge in that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=136.44s)]
*  case, part of the condition of their plea, and I will read them both in full. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  From coup lawyer Sydney Powell, quote, I apologize for my actions in connection with the events [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  in Coffee County. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=149.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  Here's what we got from her fellow coup plotter Kenneth Chesbrough, quote, I apologize to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=153.28s)]
*  the citizens of the state of Georgia and Fulton County for my involvement in count [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=157.52s)]
*  15 of the indictment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=160.84s)]
*  Doesn't even say what he did. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=163.08s)]
*  It's never been more obvious that those few people do not regret their actions in the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=166.56s)]
*  slightest, except perhaps insofar as they got caught. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=171.12s)]
*  And one of the lessons here is that you simply cannot let people like Trump and his allies [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  determine their own accountability because they simply will never do it on their own. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  They have to be brought to account by the full force of the law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=181.24s)]
*  Shan Wu is a former federal prosecutor, served as counsel to Attorney General Janet Reno. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=186.76s)]
*  Josh Marshall wrote about these, quote, really sorry letters for Talking Points Memo, where [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=190.96s)]
*  he is the founder and editor in chief, and they both join me now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=195.36s)]
*  Josh, I don't, I've never, we lost you maybe, so I'll go to you, Shan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=198.72s)]
*  Shan, first of all, in your experience doing this kind of thing, is it common for someone [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=206.24s)]
*  on a plea to give such a obviously truculent F.U. to the entire proceedings in their apology? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=214.08s)]
*  No, this is like the I'm sorry you're ugly kind of apology. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=225.84s)]
*  It's very transparent. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=226.84s)]
*  And usually the defendant wants to take that moment to convince the judge who's going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=227.84s)]
*  sentence them that they are genuinely remorseful and they have learned something from this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  And in this case, it really seems that the defendants don't have that concern at all. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  And obviously their plea structure gives them some solidity as to what they could, what's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=243.08s)]
*  the worst case scenario. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=247.8s)]
*  But honestly, I mean, if I were that judge, I wouldn't even accept that as having been [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  the apology. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=253.44s)]
*  And the prosecutor should take the same tactic, should be like a school teacher saying, go [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=254.44s)]
*  back and try it again. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=258.32s)]
*  That was going to be my next question, because I really like, I think this is wholly unacceptable [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=260.2s)]
*  at a bunch of different levels. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=263.92s)]
*  First of all, these are wealthy, privileged, affluent people who are getting to do a thing [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  that that hundreds of thousands of Americans who are run through the plea system, you know, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=269.84s)]
*  every month in this country don't get to do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=275.44s)]
*  But also because stating that you were wrong about the specifics of what happened is important [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  for the country's civic health and a huge part of why this is a meaningful prosecution. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=285.44s)]
*  So so you're saying the judge can be like, not good enough. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=289.32s)]
*  Try again. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't know if the judge could say plea deals off because of this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  But if part of the plea deal is the apology, I think the judge can say, hey, you're not [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=299.0s)]
*  fulfilling that aspect of the plea deal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  And obviously the reason here for an apology, you know, lots of cases, you know, people [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=305.32s)]
*  get convicted without an apology. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  But just like what you're saying, the critical point here is the harm done to the public [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=310.92s)]
*  and to our system and their acknowledgement is really critical. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=316.48s)]
*  And too often, you know, there's this built in kind of bias in favor of white collar defendants [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=319.6s)]
*  because it's not a violent crime. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  They get treated more lightly. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=325.76s)]
*  But these folks use, just like you're saying, their prestige, their power to abuse the system [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=327.44s)]
*  and hurt the country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=333.36s)]
*  And they really do need to be held accountable for that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=334.68s)]
*  Josh, I am not generally a sort of wrathful person. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=337.48s)]
*  It's not like usually not how I go through life. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=341.76s)]
*  But I like I really felt like I hit the roof when I saw those yesterday. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=344.08s)]
*  And I think you felt the same way because they are such an insult. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=348.68s)]
*  After all of this to do that, it's like a you can't touch me kind of thing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=352.04s)]
*  Yeah, there were there were so many layers of it because, you know, Mr. Hall's letter, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  he's the bail bondsman you mentioned, was released in the same group of documents. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=364.12s)]
*  And his is five paragraphs long. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=369.06s)]
*  It you know, pretty basic. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=371.72s)]
*  I thought I was doing the right thing when it happened. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=374.32000000000005s)]
*  But I see now I'm wrong. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=376.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, blah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=378.24s)]
*  And, you know, OK, you know, we sort of assume someone is being sincere. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=380.2s)]
*  But in the case of these two, a one sentence, not even really mentioning what they did. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=385.92s)]
*  And then it's this additional level, which is hard to say substantive, but somehow brings [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=394.18s)]
*  it all together, which is that it's it's like, you know, a workshop project in second grade, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=398.76s)]
*  Dick and Jane's first plea negotiation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  What is this like? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  Even like Chez Bros. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  It's it's like, you know, it's like it's like a five year old. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=412.72s)]
*  And these are this is a guy who went to Harvard Law School. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=415.88s)]
*  And you know, both of them are career long, successful attorneys. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=420.32s)]
*  It's just weird. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=426.32s)]
*  And when I saw it, I didn't know what to make of it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=427.64s)]
*  I mean, it in every way, it seems to communicate FU to everybody, to the state of Georgia, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  to the people of Georgia, to the prosecutor. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  It's kind of wild. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=442.96s)]
*  And there's one other aspect of this, because I think about like, you know, what's what [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=444.84s)]
*  is punishment for? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=448.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=449.0s)]
*  Coming back to this in these cases, sort of like, you know, criminal criminal philosophy [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=450.0s)]
*  of crime 101. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=454.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=455.28s)]
*  And it's like, you know, we want we, you know, we want some sort of accountability. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=456.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=461.4s)]
*  We want some sort of acknowledgement of the harm in a social sense. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=462.4s)]
*  One of the things we also want is deterrence. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  And like, I read those two things and I am not convinced, Josh, that these two aren't [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=468.08s)]
*  going to just like get back on the train for 2024 to go plot again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=472.2s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=478.23999999999995s)]
*  That was certainly the impression I got. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=479.23999999999995s)]
*  And yeah, yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=481.47999999999996s)]
*  And clearly, as you say, it's a funny thing, because, you know, we don't want to be thinking [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=484.4s)]
*  of, oh, they should be shaking in their boots, you know, because the power of the law is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  is coming down on them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=494.2s)]
*  But there are other there are other reasons we have criminal sanctions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=495.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=499.64s)]
*  One is for the society to communicate to itself what is permissible and what is not. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=500.64s)]
*  And something like this kind of communicates in a very basic way. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's a big deal because they're the big public people. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=511.32s)]
*  No one knows who Scott Hall is, the other the other defendant I was just referring to. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=514.32s)]
*  And for them to do this basically says, you know, I cut a deal. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=519.44s)]
*  I'm going to, you know, I'm going to be on probation. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=522.6400000000001s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=524.84s)]
*  I do it again. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=525.84s)]
*  And like, I'm going to I'm going to do like, you know, a little curly Q, you know, a little [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  smiley face. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=533.72s)]
*  One sentence. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=535.5200000000001s)]
*  It's just I'm very I mean, my impression was and this may be I guess the these the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=536.5200000000001s)]
*  The deals are not finalized until the case, you know, until other aspects of the case [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  come forward. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  But we haven't heard anything that the judge was like saying, OK, forget this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=548.08s)]
*  You got, you know, this is unacceptable. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=552.64s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=554.72s)]
*  Well, to share your shit. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=555.72s)]
*  And yeah, to Shan's point, I think that's that 100 percent should be the next step here. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=556.72s)]
*  And from Fannie Wilson's office, because I think we can all agree this is not acceptable. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=562.72s)]
*  I mean, it's just not acceptable, not acceptable. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=566.52s)]
*  It's a making a mockery of the of the law. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=572.72s)]
*  Any kind of accountability they're supposedly taking. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=573.72s)]
*  Shamwell, Josh Marshall. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, gentlemen. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=577.36s)]
*  Both appreciate it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=578.36s)]
*  The political landscape rumbling loudly tonight after the explosive leak of a draft Supreme [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=580.8s)]
*  Court opinion overturning Roe versus Wade. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts today confirming the draft was genuine, but calling the leak [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=589.16s)]
*  a breach of trust and ordering an investigation into who did it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=594.16s)]
*  The decision, a sharply worded takedown of Roe v. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=598.24s)]
*  Wade, has abortion opponents celebrating tonight while leaving abortion rights supporters angry [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=601.2s)]
*  and worried. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=607.16s)]
*  The leak of the decision overturning the right to an abortion in this country and the behind [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=608.8s)]
*  the scenes fight that led up to it is the subject of this fantastic new investigative [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=612.08s)]
*  piece in The New York Times. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=616.6s)]
*  Reporters Jody Cantor and Adam Liptax explain how, quote, in overturning Roe, the court [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=618.08s)]
*  set aside more than precedent. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=622.76s)]
*  It tested the boundaries of how cases are decided. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=624.36s)]
*  And joining me now is Jody Cantor, the Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter who helped [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  break this story for The New York Times. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=631.9599999999999s)]
*  Jody, it's a great piece and there's a bunch of stuff in here I want to get to. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=633.76s)]
*  I want to start with bringing people back to the timeline, which I had sort of forgotten [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  a little bit until I read your piece today, which is basically that Mississippi wants [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=642.8399999999999s)]
*  to, Mississippi passes this law banning abortion to 15 weeks. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=648.68s)]
*  They know it's frontally unconstitutional under the court's current jurisprudence, but [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  they want to test it anyway and they want to send it up to the court and they petition [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=657.48s)]
*  the court and then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=660.72s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett replaces her. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=666.84s)]
*  Tell us about the dynamics in what we think of as a conference in that court about whether [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=669.48s)]
*  to take up the case knowing how adjacent it is to Justice Ginsburg's death. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=674.4s)]
*  So one of the things that Adam Liptak and I found was that this was a real point of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=680.68s)]
*  sensitivity for the court. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=687.8s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=690.4s)]
*  On the one hand in our system of lifetime appointments, the passing of justices helps [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=691.9599999999999s)]
*  refresh the law. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=696.56s)]
*  It's part of what moves the law around, moves the law along. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  But if the law changes too quickly after a justice dies, it can look like, like this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=702.88s)]
*  is like actually Amy Coney Barrett wrote years ago in a law review article. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=708.64s)]
*  It can look like this is about politics and power instead of law and reason. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=713.36s)]
*  So so there's this debate in early 2021 about whether to take up the case, not how to decide [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=718.9200000000001s)]
*  it, but whether to take it up at all. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=725.48s)]
*  And it becomes a debate about timing. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  It's very clear that this new conservative supermajority has the votes to hear the case. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=731.8000000000001s)]
*  They have the minimum of four. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=737.6s)]
*  In fact, initially they have five. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=739.0s)]
*  But there's disagreement about when to do it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=741.5s)]
*  Justices Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas were very eager. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  They actually wanted to hear the case of that term, the term before it was actually held. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=748.94s)]
*  Whereas Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Barrett were a little reluctant. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=754.72s)]
*  Justice Kavanaugh suggested a plan to relist it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  In other words, to to withhold from the public the court's decision to take the case. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=763.92s)]
*  And actually, Justice Barrett made a really strong stand. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=769.88s)]
*  She said to the others, if you try to take this case this term, I will change my vote [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=773.52s)]
*  from a grant, a yes to a deny a no. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=779.7199999999999s)]
*  And then one of the biggest surprises of the reporting is that that is what she actually [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  ended up doing. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  She opposed hearing this case. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=790.28s)]
*  And it's key here to just set the context here when you quote that law review article, right? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=794.12s)]
*  The perception from the outside is the the anti-Roe justices are sitting around waiting [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=798.28s)]
*  for their colleague to die and then be replaced with a new person. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=804.6s)]
*  So even before her body is in the ground, they can get to planning their long desired [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=809.12s)]
*  goal of overturning Roe. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=815.24s)]
*  And I'm feeling I'm reading into things here that you didn't report. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm saying this is what it looks like to me is that Justice Barrett is like, that's going [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=821.4s)]
*  to look bad for me personally. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=825.16s)]
*  Like if we do this right away, she is objecting to it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=827.0s)]
*  But the most fascinating thing is that what Kavanaugh suggests, what they what they do [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=830.04s)]
*  is they decide to take the case and functionally deceive the public about doing so. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=834.1s)]
*  So they he named some reasons. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=840.88s)]
*  He says we're going to watch the lower court cases on abortion. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=843.36s)]
*  You know, we're going to see what happens, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=847.9200000000001s)]
*  It does have the effect of distancing, creating the appearance of distance from Justice Ginsburg's [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=851.64s)]
*  death. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=858.36s)]
*  And I agree with you that Justice Barrett is in a fascinating position because remember [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=859.36s)]
*  that President Trump said that he was going to appoint justices who would automatically [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=864.28s)]
*  overturn Roe. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=869.36s)]
*  She gets appointed. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=871.0s)]
*  She is a favorite of abortion opponents. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=872.28s)]
*  She has, you know, she has seven children. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=877.36s)]
*  You know, that is the way she's read in the public mind. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=880.24s)]
*  So I think actually the fact that she voted against taking the case gives us a lot to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=883.24s)]
*  think about in terms of the court and also about her. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=888.88s)]
*  You know, what what is the meaning of her switching her vote? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=893.76s)]
*  Ultimately, you only need four votes. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=900.16s)]
*  They take the case. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=901.72s)]
*  We all know that she ends up joining the majority, which was their their gambit all along, that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=902.72s)]
*  majority that she would in fact join it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=906.6800000000001s)]
*  But just to I want to just because it's a technical thing, but it's important to me [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=908.32s)]
*  because in some ways it's my I think the top line of this reporting is that they basically [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  decide they're going to take it in February. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  But they the way they communicate to the public isn't in February, we're going to take this [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=919.22s)]
*  case instead. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  They they relist it, meaning we haven't decided yet. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=925.4000000000001s)]
*  We haven't decided yet. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=927.6400000000001s)]
*  And they keep doing that over and over again. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=928.6400000000001s)]
*  They know they're taking it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  But they are saying, well, we don't know, even though they know they took it three months [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=932.32s)]
*  after Ginsburg died for three months after Barrett. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=937.0s)]
*  So the public doesn't know that, but they know that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=940.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  I hear what you're saying, but I'm going to give you another interpretation of the facts. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  This is also this is also introducing a delay that opens a window for persuasion, because [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=952.36s)]
*  what happens next is that, you know, there's this sort of funny period when they have the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  votes, but this is not publicly announced. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=965.04s)]
*  And Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Breyer, a conservative and a liberal, both very drawn [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=968.36s)]
*  to consensus, neither of them interested in pursuing Dobbs, have this window for persuasion. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=973.88s)]
*  And they try to convince the two newest justices not to take the case. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=980.56s)]
*  Whether that affected Justice Barrett's decision, we can't totally say for sure. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=985.48s)]
*  But we know that she ends up changing her vote. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=990.84s)]
*  So so so the appearance point you make is a strong one. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=993.84s)]
*  But you also have to ask what is happening strategically during during during this point, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=998.32s)]
*  because we know that Justice Alito gets a little nervous and says to Justice Kavanaugh, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1004.72s)]
*  is your vote firm? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1010.72s)]
*  And on that strategy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  So when we get to actually they take the case, they hear the arguments, they're they're they're [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1014.0400000000001s)]
*  drawing up the opinion, right? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1017.44s)]
*  They have the five votes for overturning Roe. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1020.32s)]
*  Frontally, Mississippi has changed. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  Once the case gets taken, they say, we're actually not asking you to rule on this law. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1026.16s)]
*  We want you to go all out at Roe. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1030.48s)]
*  They go all out at Roe in oral arguments. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1032.0800000000002s)]
*  It's like, do it, do the whole thing. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1034.1200000000001s)]
*  They've got five votes. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1035.92s)]
*  There is an effort you report on by Breyer basically in Roberts to try to pull a justice [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1037.4s)]
*  that to find some consensus, consensus position that upholds Mississippi law, which would [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1044.56s)]
*  radically pair back rights, but not end Roe. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1050.6s)]
*  What does the leak do to those efforts? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1054.88s)]
*  So that's another thing we're able to establish in this reporting. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1060.3s)]
*  I cannot tell you who leaked that document. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1063.24s)]
*  I can't tell you for sure what the motive is. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1065.88s)]
*  Adam and I can tell you the effect, which is that the leak cemented these votes. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1069.8400000000001s)]
*  Part of the reason that the votes are secret is that justices do sometimes change their [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1076.56s)]
*  mind. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1082.0s)]
*  They want that freedom. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1083.0s)]
*  They need that freedom. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1084.0s)]
*  History shows us that it's happened plenty of times with a lot of consequence. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1085.0s)]
*  And so the leak interferes with that. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1089.5s)]
*  It's hard to say what would have happened anyway. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1093.04s)]
*  There isn't overwhelming evidence that three justice compromise that would have saved the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1096.44s)]
*  right to abortion is on the cusp of becoming reality. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1104.1200000000001s)]
*  We cannot say that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1108.24s)]
*  But we know that the deliberative process was at play, that there were efforts at persuasion, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1109.68s)]
*  that Chief Justice only needed one vote to make his 15-week position work. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1115.0800000000002s)]
*  And also, Justice Breyer was so interested in this that he considered joining this 15-week [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1120.3s)]
*  position, which would have been a symbolic move. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1128.52s)]
*  And then the leak comes along, and those efforts become hopeless. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1131.46s)]
*  And so part of what we need to remember about this decision is that it really does look [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1135.3799999999999s)]
*  like somebody did something really inappropriate and intended to interfere with the process [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1140.6599999999999s)]
*  in some way. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1147.46s)]
*  That reporting about the effect, which also was new, I mean, we just didn't know. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1149.82s)]
*  We still don't know what happened, but the effect is pretty profound and pretty interesting. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1153.3799999999999s)]
*  The whole piece is fantastic. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1157.12s)]
*  Thank you, Jodie Cantor, for doing it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1158.9399999999998s)]
*  Thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1161.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1162.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVScPFiXAkM&t=1163.78s)]
