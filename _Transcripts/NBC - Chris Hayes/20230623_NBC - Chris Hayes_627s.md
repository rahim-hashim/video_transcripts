# Jan. 6 probe heats up as witnesses reportedly get immunity deals
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. A lot going on on this Friday night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we have some big developments in both of special counsel Jack Smith's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=3.5s)]
*  investigations into Donald Trump. First in the documents case just minutes ago [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  we learned that Smith has filed three motions. He's asked that the ex-president's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=12.0s)]
*  trial date originally set for this August be delayed until December 11th of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=17.0s)]
*  this year. That is to give the government more time to address procedures [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=22.2s)]
*  involving the classified documents that are crucial to the prosecution's argument. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=26.72s)]
*  Smith also requested a pre-trial conference regarding those classified [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=30.72s)]
*  documents and submitted a sealed list of witnesses that Donald Trump and his [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=35.22s)]
*  co-defendant, Walt Notta, are not allowed to speak to personally per the terms of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=39.72s)]
*  their release before trial. We're also looking at a major development in Jack [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=45.22s)]
*  Smith's other case related to January 6th. Specifically, the so-called fake [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=49.72s)]
*  electors scheme which was one of many attempts by Trump and his allies to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=55.02s)]
*  overturn the results of the 2020 election. NBC News has previously reported that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=59.02s)]
*  two of the fake electors from Nevada testified before Jack Smith's federal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=64.02000000000001s)]
*  grand jury earlier this month. Now that detail alone is pretty telling. Indicated [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  that Smith and his team are actively pursuing the fake electors as part of a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  larger investigation into Donald Trump's unlawful attempts to stay in power after [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=76.62s)]
*  the 2020 election. But a new twist today, a brand new report out now reveals [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=81.62s)]
*  these two fake electors who testified were offered partial immunity as part of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=86.62s)]
*  their cooperation with the investigation which certainly signals an escalation in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=92.12s)]
*  this portion of the inquiry. Now to explain why, we should first look at the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=96.62s)]
*  bigger picture of the whole fake electors scheme. And I gotta say, there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=101.62s)]
*  were so many parallel efforts to overturn the election and keep Donald [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=105.12s)]
*  Trump in power unlawfully against the will of the American people, it can be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=110.12s)]
*  difficult to keep track of them all. So in order to understand the fake electors [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=113.62s)]
*  scheme, you need to be familiar with some technical stuff about how the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=117.42s)]
*  electoral college works. Here is how Congressman Adam Schiff explained it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=120.92s)]
*  during one of the January 6 hearings. Under our constitution when we cast our [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=125.72s)]
*  votes for president, we are actually voting to send electors pledged to our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=131.12s)]
*  preferred candidate to the electoral college. In December, the electors in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=135.32s)]
*  each state meet, cast their votes and send those votes to Washington. There is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  only one legitimate slate of electors from each state. On the sixth day of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  January, Congress meets in a joint session to count those votes and the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=148.92s)]
*  winner of the electoral college vote becomes the president. So it's a weird [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  process. I think we should get rid of it, but it's what we got, right? So for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  example, in 2020 when Joe Biden won the state of Nevada, for instance, and it's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=160.22s)]
*  six electoral votes, the state's six Biden electors got together in December [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=164.92s)]
*  and they certified Joe Biden's victory. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=170.32s)]
*  Democrat Joe Biden now officially has Nevada's six electoral college votes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=173.92s)]
*  This morning, Nevada's electors met virtually as you see here to complete [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=178.82s)]
*  the process. Electors cast their ballots. You see there. They held them [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=182.42s)]
*  up so they could be seen by everybody watching. It's all a constitutional [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  process and it's taking place today all across the country. Member was covid. So [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=190.12s)]
*  they're meeting via zoom, right? But when those real electors were finished [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=194.32s)]
*  telling, they then submitted that document you see on your screen with the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=197.22s)]
*  signatures, right? They all signed it, attesting that Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=201.12s)]
*  Harris won their state's six electoral college votes. Now, this happens in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=204.62s)]
*  some form or another in all 50 states, or at least that is what is supposed [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  to happen. But Trump and his allies had other plans. Now, among their many [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=212.92s)]
*  schemes to overturn the results, the election one in which they would one [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=217.82s)]
*  was one in which they would promote fake Trump electors in seven states. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=222.22s)]
*  He actually lost and for each of these seven states, the fake Trump electors [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=227.02s)]
*  got together and kind of did their own like pretend version of the real thing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=232.62s)]
*  They signed their own fake attestation declaring falsely that Donald Trump [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=237.72s)]
*  and not Biden won their state. The plan was to then submit these fake electors [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=244.12s)]
*  to Mike Pence on January 6 where he had a few different options, right? He [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=249.92s)]
*  could either accept the fake Trump electors instead of the real ones and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=254.32s)]
*  just declare Trump the winner or he could say, oh, well, you know, there's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=257.32s)]
*  a there's a conflict here. Really? Who's to say and set aside both the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=261.12s)]
*  real and the fake electors in those seven states and then declare Trump the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  winner. The official Nevada GOP account actually tweeted out a picture of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  their state's fake electors ceremony. Here is the fake document they put [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=275.12s)]
*  together. I mean, it's a real document, but it's fake and what it says received [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  by the US National Archives actually mailed it to the archives in that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=284.62s)]
*  document. They attest that they and not those folks you saw on the zoom call [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=288.32s)]
*  a moment ago are the real electors for the state of Nevada and that they [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=292.12s)]
*  are submitting their six electoral votes for Trump, not by was that true? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=296.02s)]
*  It was not. So it should be obvious to anyone paying attention. This scheme [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  was at the very best legally dubious. I mean, you can't swear on a piece of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=307.32s)]
*  paper to miss and misrepresent yourself to the government as electoral college [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  elector when you are not an electoral college elector. And it seems like some [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=318.22s)]
*  of the fake electors actually knew that to listen to this two slates of fake [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=322.32s)]
*  electors, the ones from Pennsylvania, New Mexico. They were actually smart [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=326.82s)]
*  enough to hedge their bets. Both groups added caveats to their fake documents [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=331.12s)]
*  attesting they are only going to represent themselves as Trump electors [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=336.82s)]
*  if the results of the election were overturned in their respective states. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=340.42s)]
*  As a New Mexico fake electors put it, we the undersigned on the understanding [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=345.02s)]
*  it might later be determined that we are the duly elected and qualified [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=349.12s)]
*  electors for president and vice president, etc, etc. Right? See what they [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=353.02s)]
*  did there. They're like this seems dodgy, but like if you know, it turns out [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=357.22s)]
*  then like use us but not if not the other five fake slates of electors, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=361.42s)]
*  including Nevada did not do that. However, they just said were the real deal [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=367.22s)]
*  and it's not just the fake electors who likely knew what they were doing was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=372.42s)]
*  wrong. This was very much a top-down effort, which brings us to this truly [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=375.22s)]
*  amazing email exchange between an attorney helping the fake electors in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=381.12s)]
*  Arizona and Trump advisor, Boris Epstein in December 2020, the lawyer for [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=385.02s)]
*  the fake electors rights and I quote him here. We would just be sending in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=390.12s)]
*  fake electoral votes to pence so that someone in Congress can make an [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=393.82s)]
*  objection when they start counting votes and start arguing that the fake [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=397.52s)]
*  votes should be counted and then he catches himself and sends a follow-up [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  email saying following alternative votes. It's probably a better term than [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=404.82s)]
*  adding a smiley face emoji. I say bro. It's not just Trump allies who are [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  pulling the strings here and this is really crucial. There is evidence that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump himself was in on the fake electors ski. That brings us back to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=419.32s)]
*  today's news. One of the fake electors who has apparently received immunity [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  is this guy. He's the Nevada party chair, Michael McDonald. We saw him outside [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=428.62s)]
*  the courthouse in DC actually on the day that Trump was being arrayed in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=432.52s)]
*  Miami and he's already had his phone seized by the feds a year ago. He's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=435.92s)]
*  also turned over his text messages to the January 6 committee text which [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=440.22s)]
*  reveal that McDonald says he was in direct contact with Donald Trump himself [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=443.82s)]
*  when plotting the fake electors scam. No cutouts, no intermediaries quote. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=450.22s)]
*  We are on it. I have been on the phone this morning with the president, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=454.42s)]
*  Eric Trump, Mark Meadows and Mayor Giuliani. There is a major plan quote [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=458.42s)]
*  was on the phone to President Mark Meadows, Giuliani and they want full [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=463.22s)]
*  attack mode. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=466.62s)]
*  So the reason this fake electors scheme is so important from the perspective [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=469.22s)]
*  of prosecutor looking at January 6 is that when it comes to the upper [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=472.12s)]
*  echelons of people that were directing this attempted coup White House [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=476.72s)]
*  Chief of Staff Mark Meadows Rudy Giuliani, of course Trump himself. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  There are frankly a lot of thorny legal questions about what you can prove [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=483.92s)]
*  and what's actually legal or not was Trump's big lie, constitutionally [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  protected speech. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=491.32s)]
*  What about his remarks inciting the mob on January 6 were his attempts [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=492.32s)]
*  to overturn the election by pressuring Pence unlawful or simply corrupt [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=495.62s)]
*  and anti-democratic. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=500.32s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't have answers to those questions fake electors scheme. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, that seems different. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, in some ways it reminds me of the Trump documents case. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=508.32s)]
*  I mean, we know Trump had the documents. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=511.32s)]
*  We know Trump shouldn't have had the documents. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=514.02s)]
*  We know Trump didn't give the documents back when asked and he was [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=516.02s)]
*  caught red-handed when the FBI searched him. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  The fake electors scheme from the perspective of prosecutor is similar in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=522.62s)]
*  that there's a lot of just indisputable evidence. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=525.82s)]
*  These electors fraudulently signed documents claiming they were legitimate [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=528.4200000000001s)]
*  slate from their state when they were not those fake documents were then [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=532.22s)]
*  submitted to the government as though they were real possibly probably in [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=536.5200000000001s)]
*  violation of the law. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=540.72s)]
*  What's more there is evidence that Trump's inner circle was warned. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=542.82s)]
*  The plan could be unlawful. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=546.4200000000001s)]
*  And so to be clear, did you hear the White House counsel's office say that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=549.12s)]
*  this plan to have alternate electors meet and cast votes for Donald Trump in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=553.32s)]
*  states that he had lost was not legally sound? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=557.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=561.0200000000001s)]
*  And who wasn't present for that meeting that you remember? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=562.82s)]
*  Mr. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=566.82s)]
*  It was in our offices. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=567.4200000000001s)]
*  Mr. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=568.32s)]
*  Meadows, Mr. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=568.62s)]
*  Giuliani and the few Giuliani's associates. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=569.22s)]
*  So the fake electors case at the level of the fake electors seems pretty [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=572.82s)]
*  open and shut. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=575.62s)]
*  The real question is how much of it came at the direction of Donald Trump [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=576.22s)]
*  himself? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  If one of the fake electors who says he spoke to Trump about the plot is [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  cooperating with investigators, presumably he could help answer that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=585.52s)]
*  question. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=589.12s)]
*  As could former Trump election official Michael Roman, a guy who is integral [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=590.52s)]
*  to plotting the fake elector scream. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=594.72s)]
*  The New York Times is now reporting he may speak with investigators as [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=596.82s)]
*  well, which could bring us one step closer to some actual consequences [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=600.12s)]
*  for the man most responsible for January 6th. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGyZY9NiCM&t=603.92s)]
