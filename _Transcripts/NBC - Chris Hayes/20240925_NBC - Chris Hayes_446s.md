# See Stephanie Ruhle react after her exclusive interview with Kamala Harris
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0)
*  Stephanie Ruhl, NBC News Senior Business Analyst, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Host of The Alarm Without Her Joins Me Now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=2.92s)]
*  Stephanie, can I just say that was a great interview [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=4.2s)]
*  and I thought you pressed her on really important stuff. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=6.88s)]
*  It was also, I just thought it was the whole thing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=9.76s)]
*  was refreshingly substantive. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=12.8s)]
*  This was, you know, you can say I don't like that policy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=15.08s)]
*  or I do like that policy, but it really was about like, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=18.36s)]
*  here the earth we live in, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=21.48s)]
*  the kinds of decisions you're gonna make [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=23.72s)]
*  and it wasn't pie in the sky stuff. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=25.7s)]
*  So very, very well done job. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=27.28s)]
*  Let me just start by saying that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=29.24s)]
*  Okay, well I'm just gonna sit here [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  and soak in those compliments, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=34.92s)]
*  so we don't have to talk about anything else. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=36.6s)]
*  But I think what you're actually complimenting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=38.36s)]
*  is that it was a normal interview, Chris. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=41.5s)]
*  That's actually what it was. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  It was a normal interview. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=45.68s)]
*  It was a person running to be the President [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=47.0s)]
*  of the United States and for 25 minutes, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=49.44s)]
*  we talked about their vision and we talked about policy [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=52.72s)]
*  and I think you just said it right there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's A-okay [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=58.12s)]
*  if you don't like her policies, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=60.08s)]
*  She made it very clear. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  If you make over 400 grand a year, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=63.08s)]
*  next year when the individual tax cuts expire, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=65.08s)]
*  she's gonna raise your taxes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=68.97999999999999s)]
*  So if you're someone who just votes on that, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=70.24s)]
*  well then you know what you're doing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=72.56s)]
*  You don't wanna vote for her. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=73.4s)]
*  And I think that it's just that we're so desensitized [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=74.74s)]
*  in that so many interviews that we do [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=79.74s)]
*  were forced to cover so much lunacy or so much crazy [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  or so much fact checking or get distracted [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=86.48s)]
*  by so many issues that aren't poor policies [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  that serve the American people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  What you saw right there was just a sort of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=93.58s)]
*  a classic interview with somebody running for President. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=96.48s)]
*  I thought the point that there's a number [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=99.36s)]
*  of really interesting exchanges. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=101.2s)]
*  I thought the exchanges on tariffs was really interesting, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  particularly when you said, look, which is true. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=104.28s)]
*  You know, I think people think we live [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=106.12s)]
*  in this free trade era, which we do compared to previous, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=108.76s)]
*  but there's also lots of tariffs on lots of stuff. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=111.68s)]
*  Presidents have unbelievable unilateral authority [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=113.58000000000001s)]
*  to apply them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=115.76s)]
*  I remember George W. Bush doing this on aluminum and steel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  I remember, obviously Trump did it, Joe Biden, as you noted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=119.92s)]
*  He basically said, look, where are you? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=123.04s)]
*  And I thought her answer was interesting, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=124.4s)]
*  which is basically like, well, it kind of depends, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=126.2s)]
*  But we're not gonna throw up a 20% tariff [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=128.76s)]
*  around the whole country, which is not a serious idea. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  But I think that's the important part, sort of the nuance, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=136.24s)]
*  because I'm gonna be honest, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=139.28s)]
*  President Biden has tariffs in place. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  He's held a lot of Donald Trump's tariffs in place. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=142.96s)]
*  And the White House doesn't like to talk about it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  They don't like it when you ask them about it, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=147.78s)]
*  because everybody has gotten in this zone of like, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=149.96s)]
*  Trump's the tariff guy, we're not the tariff people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  We're here on the other side. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=154.96s)]
*  And what she did right there is kind of explain [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=155.88s)]
*  that it's complicated, right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  We're a country of 330 million people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=160.06s)]
*  Our economy is complicated, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=162.24s)]
*  In the same way, is the economy good or bad? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=164.4s)]
*  It totally depends. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=166.44s)]
*  So tariffs, if used in the right places, can work. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  And one could watch that and say, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=171.16s)]
*  well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=172.72s)]
*  That's okay, because we are not talking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=174.6s)]
*  about clear or direct issues. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=176.68s)]
*  The question about inflation and prices, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=179.5s)]
*  this to me is one of the, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=182.68s)]
*  it's sort of one of the most frustrating aspects [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=184.56s)]
*  of this campaign. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=186.4s)]
*  The thing that people are 100% correctly, rationally, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=188.12s)]
*  and understandably reacting to is two or three years [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=191.92s)]
*  of the highest rate of inflation we've had in a generation, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=195.24s)]
*  which has been incredibly unpleasant. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=198.32s)]
*  It spiked the prices of things, things got more expensive. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=201.72s)]
*  The issue, of course, is that that period [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=205.66s)]
*  was basically born of the end of the pandemic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  and the supply crunch and a combination of that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=211.24s)]
*  and monetary policy has brought it down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=213.56s)]
*  So now you've got this weird situation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=216.08s)]
*  where both major party candidates kind of gotta say [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=217.44s)]
*  what they're gonna do to bring prices down, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=219.56s)]
*  even though what everyone's reacting to is an issue [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=222.36s)]
*  that is a little bit in the past. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=226.08s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=228.84s)]
*  So she's got the price gouging thing, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=229.84s)]
*  which I thought was a good answer, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=231.2s)]
*  but in some ways, no one's really talking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  about the real thing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=234.6s)]
*  It is a little bit in the past, and listen, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  everybody is, lots of people are angry [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=240.6s)]
*  that grocery stores have made so much money [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  and they shouldn't, and I'm not defending grocery stores, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  but we should remember when we're like, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  we need to put price controls on things. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=249.04s)]
*  There are tons of businesses [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=251.54s)]
*  that are not high margin businesses, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=252.92s)]
*  and there are lots of years when those industries [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  are not making a ton of money. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=257.0s)]
*  But what I find interesting, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=258.96s)]
*  when she talks about looking into price gouging, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=260.44s)]
*  people freak out and they're like, look, she's a socialist. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=262.88s)]
*  I knew she was gonna be a socialist. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  This woman is not a capitalist, and they bug out over it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=266.23999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump this week was like, when I become president, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=269.02s)]
*  look at the interest rates you're paying on credit cards. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=272.64s)]
*  I'm gonna cap that, there's no way they can do that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  He's going full on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=277.44s)]
*  A unilateral announcement of a 10% cap [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=279.08s)]
*  on credit card interest rates. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=282.0s)]
*  Correct, when I call ride or die capitalists [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=285.76s)]
*  and they're like, oh, it's nonsense. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=289.24s)]
*  He's just talking talk. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  But when she says anything that even sniffs like it, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  they're like, see, she's a socialist nutball. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=294.48s)]
*  So it's completely crazy, but you've got candidates [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=296.8s)]
*  that are trying to address an issue [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  that has the American people angry [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  and the American people aren't addressing, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=305.3s)]
*  aren't thinking about what you just mentioned, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  which is remember where we came from, a pandemic. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  Finally, let me just ask you this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=316.04s)]
*  I'm editorializing here, but I feel like the times [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=317.4s)]
*  that I've seen the vice president on her feet, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=323.12s)]
*  which would be since she became the nominee, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=326.96s)]
*  which would be the interview she did at CNN, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=329.64s)]
*  some of the local interviews she's done, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=332.28s)]
*  the things she did with Oprah, the debate, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  the interview with you, she's obviously quite adept, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  she's quite deft, she's quite fluid. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=339.32s)]
*  It does seem to me like it would benefit them [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=342.14s)]
*  and benefit the public just at a deep substantive level [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=344.94s)]
*  to talk more about this stuff. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=348.2s)]
*  I feel like I learned something. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=350.48s)]
*  Okay, I think that 100% because what's crazy is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=354.24s)]
*  that Donald Trump gets so much credit [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=358.0s)]
*  and has for the last nine years of the fact that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=360.56s)]
*  people have access to him and he says what he thinks [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=363.92s)]
*  and he just lets it rip, but much of what he says [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=365.98s)]
*  either doesn't make sense or it's not true. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=368.36s)]
*  She actually was perfectly reasonable. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=370.92s)]
*  And listen, there's some things she's not giving you [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=373.04s)]
*  a direct answer on because she's a politician. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=375.04s)]
*  But I agree with you that getting a chance to speak to her, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=377.88s)]
*  getting to the American people to hear from her more. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=381.04s)]
*  What do you do with the fact, if you're her campaign, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=384.68s)]
*  when people hear over and over, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=386.92s)]
*  I don't really know what her policies are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=388.12s)]
*  and they can say, well look, we have this book [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  and it has 82 pages. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  I guarantee there are people who watched tonight [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=393.12s)]
*  who went, oh, taxes only increase if you make [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  over 400 grand because there's all sorts of people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  like, well, my tax cut's gonna run out, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  maybe my taxes are gonna go up next year. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=403.04s)]
*  They're not really reading the 82 page plan. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=405.88s)]
*  And so I think the more, and she doesn't necessarily [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=408.44s)]
*  have to do with us, the more she sits down. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=410.32s)]
*  I mean, she's a great interviewer. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=412.23999999999995s)]
*  I sat down with her for 25 minutes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, go talk. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=415.23999999999995s)]
*  You might not have liked all of her answers, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=416.08s)]
*  but she had one for every single question. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=417.52s)]
*  Well, that was great. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=420.96s)]
*  I learned a lot. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  Excellent job, my friend. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=423.24s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl, thank you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=424.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Yje5K1aJ0&t=434.96s)]
