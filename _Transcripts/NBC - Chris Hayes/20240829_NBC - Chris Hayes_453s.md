# ‘Intimidation’ MAGA Texas AG orders raids on homes of Latino Democrats
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk)
*  Sherrilyn Eiffel is a former president and director of counsel at NAACP Legal Defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=0.0s)]
*  Fund. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=4.24s)]
*  She holds the Vernon Jordan Chair in Civil Rights at Howard University School of Law, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=5.24s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=8.52s)]
*  Sherrilyn, I want to maybe start on that LULAC story just because I think it hasn't quite [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=10.32s)]
*  gotten enough attention. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=16.28s)]
*  And to me, I do think it's basically right out of the mid-20th century descriptions of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  authoritarian life, particularly in America as compared to America land of the free, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=28.88s)]
*  That here your political activities are protected, you can vote for everyone, you can speak freely, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=34.68s)]
*  there's not going to be the knock at the door. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=39.28s)]
*  It's almost iconic, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  The state comes to do something to you in retribution if you cross them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=42.08s)]
*  And that's really what it looks like Paxton's doing in Texas. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=47.56s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, I'm glad to be with you and I'm glad you're giving attention to this story [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=51.36s)]
*  because this is incredibly ominous. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=57.12s)]
*  When you hear that woman, 87 years old, describing what happened to her, describing how she was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=60.0s)]
*  surrounded by police officers, it's unconscionable. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=64.92s)]
*  And it is anti-democratic. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=68.24s)]
*  But I have to say this, Chris, this is a play that has happened before. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=69.24s)]
*  This is something that Republicans did in Alabama, as you know, against voters, folks [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=75.36s)]
*  who were helping folks register to vote and helping elderly voters, Albert and Evelyn [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=82.0s)]
*  Turner. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=86.4s)]
*  That time, Jeff Sessions was the U.S. attorney and brought charges against them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=87.68s)]
*  And what was so important to me in listening to your report just now, Chris, was hearing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=93.68s)]
*  her say that, you know, she's afraid that it will interfere with them doing their work. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=97.72s)]
*  Because what happened in Perry County, Alabama, when Sessions did what he did, was that it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=103.9s)]
*  intimidated elderly voters from voting absentee, which is what they wanted to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  In this case, this is LULAC, the oldest Latino advocacy organization in the country, working [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=114.3s)]
*  to register voters. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=119.94s)]
*  And this is an effort to frighten them from doing that critically important work. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=121.94s)]
*  And the only upside of this, Chris, is this is how we know Texas is in play. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=125.94s)]
*  We know that Texas is in play because they're starting to panic. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=129.82s)]
*  But we've got to get serious about this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=133.9s)]
*  I think a number of us have reached out to the Department of Justice. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=135.94s)]
*  It's very, very serious indeed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=138.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  And your point there, just to stress for a second, because I want to sort of make two [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  points. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=146.54s)]
*  One is sort of the idea of, you know, these authoritarian states that are over there, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=147.54s)]
*  right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=150.46s)]
*  This is our nightmare. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=151.46s)]
*  But also the deep American tradition here, and as someone who is versed in this, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=152.46s)]
*  Like, thuggish intimidation, whether for the courts, through local police, or just thuggish [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=156.34s)]
*  violent mobs, is the story of voter intimidation and anti-democratic rule in the United States [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=162.72s)]
*  through the years, particularly in the wake of the Civil War and black liberation in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=168.9s)]
*  aftermath of it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=173.94s)]
*  And that is, at this point to me, the sort of unifying, a huge unifying element of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=176.14s)]
*  Trump Republican Party in this moment. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=182.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's pulling a thread that already existed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  He didn't create it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=188.74s)]
*  And you know, they are returning. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=190.66s)]
*  We should also remember, Chris, that I think it was 2018 was the first election we had [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=193.1s)]
*  where the Republican Party was removed from a consent decree that had covered it for 30 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=198.62s)]
*  years for its activities in the 1980s engaged in its ballot security program. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=203.78s)]
*  So sometimes, with all respect, I mean, Trump is a nightmare, but I want to be very clear [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=208.98s)]
*  that he did not create this, that this has been part of the playbook of the Republican [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=214.3s)]
*  Party that has had to be constrained by courts, by advocacy, by litigation, and by the Justice [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=218.3s)]
*  Department. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=224.74s)]
*  Trump has just re-upped something that exists in the playbook that we had hoped was put [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=226.1s)]
*  on the shelf. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=231.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=232.26s)]
*  And I want to highlight a story out of Virginia where, again, these sort of, I think you have [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=233.26s)]
*  a kind of combination, fusing of the old and the new, right, these sort of old tactics, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=237.98s)]
*  but the kind of, the more toothsome menace, frankly, of the sort of Trump-era version. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=241.94s)]
*  So Republicans have a goal now of identifying 5,000 volunteers to serve as poll watchers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=246.74s)]
*  for every precinct during all 45 days of voting in Virginia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=251.38s)]
*  Republican Party Chairman Michael Watlees, his volunteers are thoroughly trained about [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=254.66s)]
*  the mechanics of how poll watching should happen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=257.82s)]
*  When asked about concerns, Republicans might try to block certification. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=260.06s)]
*  He says Republicans won't have issues with certification if he says the election is free, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=263.14s)]
*  accurate, secure, and transparent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=267.26s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=269.06s)]
*  Well, again, for some time, organizations like True the Vote, right-wing organizations, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=272.18s)]
*  have been engaged in this process of attempting to kind of develop an army to challenge folks [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=278.22s)]
*  at the polls. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=283.04s)]
*  This particular training was co-sponsored by the Trump campaign. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=284.3s)]
*  So one thing that's different about it is that it's not only the Republican Party, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=288.18s)]
*  it's also the Trump campaign that's engaged in this training. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=291.62s)]
*  And again, this is about intimidation, and we're seeing this around the country too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=295.98s)]
*  Remember, Georgia's voter suppression law now allows for unlimited challenges. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=299.54s)]
*  You can challenge anybody. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  Any voter can challenge anybody who they think is not a legitimate voter. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=305.18s)]
*  So the purpose of this is to muck up the gears, is to intimidate people, is to—I [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=309.5s)]
*  mean, you know, the Virginia trainer said, you know, if you see something, then something's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=315.06s)]
*  wrong, you know, and you have to do something about it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=320.46s)]
*  So this is the idea that, you know, every single person is deputized to tell that something [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=323.5s)]
*  is wrong. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=329.66s)]
*  And all you have to do is think about Rudy Giuliani accusing Shea Moss and her mom, you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=330.66s)]
*  know, of exchanging flash drives when they were exchanging ginger mints, you know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=337.58s)]
*  But this is what they want, is to create some plausible way of suggesting that the election [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  was stolen or that there was some fraud. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=350.34s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll just say as a last point, and I imagine you agree with this, the solution [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=352.26s)]
*  to that is to refuse to be intimidated, right, is to organize and to go out and to not let [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=357.62s)]
*  them intimidate folks as much as is possible. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=362.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, this is where the Nebraska case is a little bit different, because in the case [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=367.18s)]
*  of Nebraska, it's formerly incarcerated people who had their vote restored to them by a 2005 [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=371.62s)]
*  law that was expanded in 2024. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=377.38s)]
*  And the state AG instructed all of the county officials, decided that both of those laws [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=379.94s)]
*  were unconstitutional, and it instructed county officials to stop registering formerly incarcerated [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=385.18s)]
*  folks to vote. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=390.14s)]
*  That case was heard in the Nebraska Supreme Court yesterday, and we'll see what happens [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=391.24s)]
*  And Chris, just last thing, you'll remember Nebraska is one of the few states, in fact, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  one of two states that splits their electoral votes by congressional district. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=399.54s)]
*  And that's why this is so important, because of that second congressional district near [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=403.74s)]
*  Omaha, where Biden won in 2020, Trump won in 2016, where every vote literally counts. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=407.98s)]
*  So people think Nebraska is not a swing state and that it has something to do with the national [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=415.24s)]
*  election. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=419.54s)]
*  It does. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=420.62s)]
*  Oh no, there's a bunch of scenarios where the second congressional district in Nebraska [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=422.62s)]
*  swings the entire election. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=426.66s)]
*  Sherrilyn Eiffel, thank you very much for your time today, I really appreciate it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=427.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=431.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-fYfoxl-Kk&t=451.62s)]
