# Debunking the right-wing myth of the ‘migrant crime surge’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q)
*  If you have tuned in to right-wing media at all over the past few months, you might have noticed that after spending years beating the drum on inflation, Fox News does not really want to talk about the economy anymore. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  They sure as heck do not want to talk about abortion. So what is their new pet issue heading into the general election? So-called migrant crime. That's it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=9.5s)]
*  Honestly, you cannot overstate the deluge of coverage. At any given moment all day, Fox is either reporting on crime, finishing a segment of crime, or about to run a segment on migrant crime. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=19.0s)]
*  Migrant crime is beginning to spiral out of control. There's a migrant crime spree killing Americans. Migrant crime wave. The migrant crime crisis. Migrant crime. The growing immigrant crime crisis. Every third day there's a story about some sort of migrant crime. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=32.0s)]
*  The drumbeat of propaganda has been moving not just Republicans, but public opinion overall in a really bad direction. A recent Pew poll found that a clear majority of Americans believe a large increase in the migrant population leads to an increase in crime. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=48.0s)]
*  The problem is, it's not true. It is simply not true. It is a right-wing invention. According to preliminary data from last year published by the New York Times, quote, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=61.0s)]
*  The country is likely to see one of the largest, if not the largest, yearly declines in homicides. That's right. We are going to set a record in 2023 for a drop in homicides. So to recap, homicides saw a near-record single-year spike under Donald Trump, and it now appears the largest single-year decline in homicides ever in American history happened under Joe Biden. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=71.0s)]
*  I will further speculate that if 2023 saw the biggest one-year increase, increase in the homicide rate in recorded American history, everyone would know about it. But what's more, according to a new analysis from NBC News, quote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=97.0s)]
*  Expert analysis and available data from major city police departments show, despite several horrifying high-profile incidents, there is no evidence of a migrant-driven crime wave in the United States. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=111.0s)]
*  In fact, in many of the cities, like New York, that have taken in a huge amount of migrants and really have been a lot, crime has gone down quite considerably. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=122.0s)]
*  There you have it. It's not just, of course, the data that matters, because this manufactured crisis is at the heart of Donald Trump's monstrous vision for a second term. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=130.0s)]
*  As president, I will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to remove Joe Biden's illegals and murderers, because that's what many of them are. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=139.0s)]
*  It's very simple. If they don't go back to their countries, we will never get back our country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=151.0s)]
*  It's predicated on lies, but they're effective lies. And we need to combat Trump's promises with an alternate vision for our future. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=157.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and Republicans are not interested in that. They're not interested in solutions at all. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=166.0s)]
*  As President Biden noted today during his visit to the border, they won't even consider the very conservative border bill that was struck as a deal between Republicans and Democrats before Donald Trump killed it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=170.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is wrong about migrants. He's proposing what amounts to a system, get this, of national martial law that would deport eight million people with the National Guards of right-wing states being brought in to do it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=182.0s)]
*  Americans don't actually want that. The only way to make the case is to start trying to combat his false framing instead of trying to operate within it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHuzp5rd1Q&t=194.0s)]
