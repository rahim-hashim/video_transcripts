# 'It's a horror movie every night' Gaza resident shares 'terror' of war
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI)
*  I also spoke with someone who's still in Gaza City right now, Yusuf Hamash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=0.0s)]
*  He works for a Norwegian NGO. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=3.68s)]
*  He filed a report we played part of for UK's Channel 4. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=5.98s)]
*  He's lived in Gaza his whole life and described what he's seen the last few days. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=9.48s)]
*  Yusuf Hamash is an advocacy officer with the Norwegian Refugee Council. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=18.48s)]
*  He has lived in Gaza his whole life, and he joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=22.56s)]
*  Yusuf, thank you so much for talking to us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=26.0s)]
*  Can you tell us where in Gaza you are and what it is like there? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=28.16s)]
*  Thanks for hosting me. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=31.84s)]
*  I'm an immigrant here and also part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=34.84s)]
*  And if you want to describe the situation, it's horror here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=37.84s)]
*  It's part of the hell here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=41.84s)]
*  Obama didn't stop for a second since six days in a row. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=43.84s)]
*  Wherever you go in Gaza, you will see rubbles everywhere. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=47.84s)]
*  If you cross a distance from a place to another place, it's like a maze. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=52.84s)]
*  Going from street to another street because most of the streets are blocked by rubbles [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=58.52s)]
*  and stretch everywhere. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=62.52s)]
*  No food, no electricity, no water, no internet connection. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=63.52s)]
*  Even I have to stand in the street just to get signal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm really surprised that that phone call is functioning because they usually drop off [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  quickly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  The situation is deteriorating really quickly for the most vulnerable people who had to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  flee from the north and parts of Gaza seeking shelter in the north schools. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=85.2s)]
*  Now we are full, even above their capacities. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=88.2s)]
*  Now people who are lucky to have some relatives who live in some areas that haven't been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  bombed, so they have to go seeking shelter in their houses. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  There is no one housing that is hosting one family. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Everyone is hosting another one of their relatives who lost their house or they are forced to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  flee. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  You were there in 2014, the last time that there was a war between Hamas and Israel in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  Gaza, specifically. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=117.88s)]
*  Is this more destruction? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=120.88s)]
*  Are the airstrikes and the bombing a wider area than what happened in 2014 in these first [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=123.88s)]
*  six days? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=129.88s)]
*  It was 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2021. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=130.88s)]
*  Between that also there was a lot of small ground fights. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=137.56s)]
*  This cannot be compared to what we witnessed previously. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=140.56s)]
*  This is a massive bombardment that they are using. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=144.56s)]
*  Bombardment all over Gaza Strip. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=147.56s)]
*  There is no single place safe in Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=149.56s)]
*  Usually when you have escalation in Gaza, the most affected areas are the north and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=152.56s)]
*  eastern part, northern areas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=157.56s)]
*  But now all of Gaza Strip is affected because, as you see for sure everyone saw in the news, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=159.56s)]
*  the central Gaza city, which is the main area, has been turned to ash. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=167.56s)]
*  The situation is really difficult here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=170.56s)]
*  There is no place safe in all of Gaza. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=172.56s)]
*  For the people who don't know Gaza, it's a narrow piece of land. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=175.56s)]
*  It's like a block of concrete. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=177.56s)]
*  The houses are connected to each other. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=179.56s)]
*  The situation now cannot be compared to any war or escalation before. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=182.56s)]
*  It's madness. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=187.56s)]
*  You talked about the humanitarian basics, obviously shelter being one of them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=191.24s)]
*  We have numbers that there are as many as 300,000 people who are now homeless out of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=197.24s)]
*  a population of 2 million. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=202.24s)]
*  Water, electricity is running out, water, food, like where, just from a, how are people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=205.24s)]
*  acquiring food and is there clean water still? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  We have different sources of water and gas. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  One of them is the municipality lines. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=219.72s)]
*  But the main issue is electricity because even if you have the source of water, you [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=221.72s)]
*  cannot pump it or push it into your houses. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=224.72s)]
*  The number you are talking about, over 300,000 who are fled into a normal school, there is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=227.72s)]
*  double this number who fled to other relatives' house and sheath a hospital. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=232.72s)]
*  There is trashes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=237.72s)]
*  There is people are sheltered everywhere in Gaza just seeking shelter in different places. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=239.72s)]
*  It's not only in the school. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=244.8s)]
*  Almost every place that is not governmental and not planning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=247.8s)]
*  Any place that is related to Norway, United Nations, trash, people are trying to secure [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=252.8s)]
*  themselves, convincing themselves that these places are safe. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=260.28s)]
*  For example, if you look to a Shefa hospital, it became from a hospital to a shelter. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=263.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=268.28s)]
*  It's transfer. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=269.28s)]
*  I'm wondering what, obviously the governing authority in Gaza, Samas, what are they saying [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=272.84s)]
*  to the people of Gaza about what is happening and what is about to happen? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=281.28s)]
*  There are people in Gaza disconnected from the world and from everything else. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=288.28s)]
*  Even in terms of internet, they cannot connect with each other. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=292.28s)]
*  There is no internet and there is no also signal communication because all of these [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=295.28s)]
*  signals are being born. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=298.28s)]
*  And trust me, there are two million people in Gaza are thinking, living second by second [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=299.28s)]
*  because no one can ensure the next second that they will be alive. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=306.28s)]
*  What we think about is to secure our children, secure our basically every day have to go [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=309.28s)]
*  to wait in line in front of a bakery for more than two hours just to get a bucket of bread. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=314.28s)]
*  This is the situation in Gaza. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=319.28s)]
*  There is, of course, no way out because of the RAFA crossing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=323.28s)]
*  Do you, I mean, what you just said it, I guess, second by second. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=328.28s)]
*  I hope that you and you can keep your family safe. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=333.28s)]
*  And I'm so appreciative of your taking time to talk to us. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=338.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=343.28s)]
*  And we are trying to secure a safe. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=345.28s)]
*  I have to flee from my house to my one of my relatives' house. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=347.28s)]
*  I was lucky to come on, except to me because I live in a bit of an area. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=350.28s)]
*  Also, my mother, my sisters are not different. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=355.28s)]
*  One of other relatives house. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=358.28s)]
*  The situation is really unacceptable. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=360.28s)]
*  And also, we are getting every night. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=362.28s)]
*  We are afraid from the night in general now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=364.28s)]
*  Whenever it's night, it's it's terrible. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=366.28s)]
*  We are afraid. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=368.28s)]
*  It's a horror movie. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=369.28s)]
*  Every night we are. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=370.28s)]
*  And we are always been. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=371.28s)]
*  We are going to see the daylight again. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=373.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB5gzYfKQvI&t=380.28s)]
