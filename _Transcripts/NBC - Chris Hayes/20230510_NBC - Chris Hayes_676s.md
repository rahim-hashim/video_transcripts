Video Description: Rachel Maddow on the jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse in the E. Jean Carroll trial: “Her bravery and putting herself through that did something for the country in terms of establishing a truth there. You can spit at it and you can pretend it didn’t happen, but all fair-minded people will recognize that it did, and will recognize that jury did its job.”

# Maddow: Trump sexual abuse verdict ‘established a truth’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk)
*  Rachel Maddow's fantastic podcast, Rachel Maddow Presents Ultra, just won the 2023 Hillman Prize for broadcast journalism last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=0.0s)]
*  The podcast explores the long forgotten, seditious conspiracy in the lead up to World War II, the plot to overthrow the U.S. government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=9.0s)]
*  Rachel is, of course, the host of MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, and she joins me now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=17.0s)]
*  Rachel, congratulations on the well-deserved award. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=22.0s)]
*  I was walking with a journalist I know today who was just apropos of nothing raving about Ultra, and we just talked about it for about fully 15 minutes about how great it was and how relevant it is, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=24.0s)]
*  precisely because the seditious conspiracy trial that appears in your podcast ends up not being successful, unlike the three the government has managed to win so far. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=34.0s)]
*  It is remarkable. I mean, so Ultra, weirdly the timing on it was strange. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=48.0s)]
*  We launched Ultra, the podcast, right when the seditious conspiracy trial started against the Oath Keepers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=53.0s)]
*  We finished launching the podcast. The final episode came out when the first verdict came out in the first seditious conspiracy trial. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=59.0s)]
*  You could have knocked me over with a feather if you had told me before the conclusion of those trials that we would have three successful sedition prosecutions by the Justice Department around January 6th. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=67.0s)]
*  I mean, sedition is really, really hard to prove and for good reason. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=77.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, right as Americans, it is it is it is legal for us to say terrible things and believe terrible things. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=81.0s)]
*  And believe terrible things and even to advocate for politically terrible things. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=89.0s)]
*  We can be awful people who want to awful things to happen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=93.0s)]
*  We have those rights under the Constitution and God bless us for it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=97.0s)]
*  But that means a sedition prosecution is is is all but impossible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=100.0s)]
*  I mean, in 2012 in Michigan, right in in 1988 at the Fort Smith Sedition Trial, which is a big white power trial in 1944, which was the one in Ultra of all the Nazis and fascists. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=103.0s)]
*  All the sedition trials almost always fail. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=113.0s)]
*  And yet the Justice Department has in for multiple now two different pro Trump right wing paramilitary groups. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=116.0s)]
*  Multiple trials has been able to get conviction after conviction after conviction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=123.0s)]
*  And that is important about the work of the Justice Department. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=127.0s)]
*  I think it's important also in terms of the work of what Donald Trump is trying to do and how. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=131.0s)]
*  And I think it is going to change what's possible for him in terms of what he's trying to do to the country going forward. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=136.0s)]
*  So I want to I want to follow up on that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=141.0s)]
*  But but first, as you were saying that something struck me, that's important. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=144.0s)]
*  The part of the experience the last eight years is a sort of feeling of gaslighting and sort of fabric of reality being torn apart and a lot of what about ism when you just say simple state, simple and clear and obvious facts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=148.0s)]
*  And one of the things I think that's been really interesting about those three seditious conspiracy trials and then the verdict from the jury in the civil trial for sexual abuse and defamation rendered. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=160.0s)]
*  Against Donald Trump this week is that, you know, there's no like referees in our lives. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=170.0s)]
*  There's no there's no teacher. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=175.0s)]
*  There's no principle you appeal to. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=176.0s)]
*  Like there's no one to be like, is this true or false? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=177.0s)]
*  It's like what we have at the highest level of process is that you go before a jury and you make arguments and you introduce evidence. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=179.0s)]
*  These people debate and then they come back and they say, like, this is the way it is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=187.0s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=192.0s)]
*  And this is the way it is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=193.0s)]
*  And there is something reassuring in both of these cases to have some grounding amidst the madness of the gaslighting and all that that that I have personally found important in a sort of civic sense. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=195.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=208.0s)]
*  And it's why in the Trump era of American right wing politics, people like you and I and lots of people watching us right now feel like we've become fake lawyers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=209.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=219.0s)]
*  Like, none of you are lawyers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=220.0s)]
*  Like, we both know lots of lawyers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=222.0s)]
*  You're married to a very, very good one. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=224.0s)]
*  But like, we've all had to become sort of minor experts in criminal and to a lesser degree civil procedure because the courts are for all their failings. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=225.0s)]
*  They are a place in which you must provide facts to back up your assertions. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=235.0s)]
*  They are tested in a rigorous adversarial process. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=241.0s)]
*  There is a judge and often a jury who are further going to test those assertions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=244.0s)]
*  And you can't just say stuff without being held accountable for the consequences of those words. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=248.0s)]
*  And that's not true in public life the way that it is true in the courtroom. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=253.0s)]
*  And so it means the courts have been really, really important and the courts can't do everything. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=257.0s)]
*  But when they've shown that they can do really difficult stuff like sedition prosecutions, I think it does matter. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=262.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=269.0s)]
*  I mean, if you are running an authoritarian movement, you are trying to replace democracy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=270.0s)]
*  And part of the way that you do that is by using force. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=275.0s)]
*  Use force to try to get what you want, to stop the certification of the vote, say. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=277.0s)]
*  But it's mostly to intimidate normal people out of participating in normal politics. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=281.0s)]
*  It's to make the political environment scary, violent, intimidating, overwhelming, make it feel like it's not for you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=286.0s)]
*  So that space can instead be flooded by the authoritarian force. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=293.0s)]
*  These seditious conspiracy convictions at multiple trials make it harder for Trump to organize that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=297.0s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that he goes to jail for it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=304.0s)]
*  The violence is not by him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=307.0s)]
*  It's for him. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=309.0s)]
*  And we don't know how that's going to be prosecuted if at all. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=311.0s)]
*  We'll see what Jack Smith has to say. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=313.0s)]
*  But it does take away an important tool for his overall project. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=315.0s)]
*  Well, and this is this is why I actually think, you know, I don't have access to the facts that that Jack Smith's, you know, investigators do. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=320.0s)]
*  We do have access to a lot of facts. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=328.0s)]
*  There's a January 6th committee report. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=330.0s)]
*  There's like the day of January 6th. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=332.0s)]
*  You and I were, you know, covering it live on television. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=334.0s)]
*  This was not totally done in secret. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=337.0s)]
*  The man got in front of the circle and said, like, march with me down the Capitol. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=339.0s)]
*  And I honestly feel at this point him facing trial for his involvement. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=342.0s)]
*  I don't know what specifically which which of the parts of the criminal code there were four recommendations January 6th. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=349.0s)]
*  It's like the highest level of process that we could again produce. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=356.0s)]
*  Right. It's like, let's have it out as almost existential democratic question. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=361.0s)]
*  Like, did this man do this thing in in the one place that we could have? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=365.0s)]
*  You know, we have laws of evidence. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=371.0s)]
*  We have a jury of all that stuff. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=372.0s)]
*  It feels necessary civically to me that if it doesn't happen, doesn't happen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=374.0s)]
*  I think why I want it, not because I want him to go to jail, not because I want the catharsis, not because because for civic reasons, that's the thing we can do. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=378.0s)]
*  To your point about where these disputes end up about what are the facts of the matter, who did what, and are they blameworthy? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=385.0s)]
*  Yes. And getting the facts about what happened right is still an ongoing process. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=392.0s)]
*  I mean, I know you're going to talk about Senator Tupperville with Jamal Bowie later on. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=397.0s)]
*  I'm really looking forward to hearing that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=401.0s)]
*  I mean, part of what Senator Tupperville said in that interview where he said that the Biden administration shouldn't be trying to run white nationalists out of the military. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=403.0s)]
*  Part of what he said was that it was, you know, I think his phrase was something like there were 100 people who came in through doors that ought to have been locked. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=413.0s)]
*  Something in that effect. And that's what went wrong on January 6. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=421.0s)]
*  I mean, he was there. That was his first day at work. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=424.0s)]
*  And he was he's he's still trying to sell this this fiction of what happened there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=426.0s)]
*  And that's important. But I think your what your sort of words of caution about like, don't do this for catharsis. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=431.0s)]
*  Don't do this because this is like an ejector button in terms of this problem on the American right is really important. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=438.0s)]
*  I mean, bottom line here, let's say Donald Trump is convicted of something that, you know, like Stuart Rhodes puts him in jail for 25 years, whatever it is. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=445.0s)]
*  Like whatever the worst thing is that you can imagine that the criminal justice system can do to him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=453.0s)]
*  None of that would disqualify him from running for president. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=457.0s)]
*  You can run for president from prison. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=460.0s)]
*  Arguably, you can win the presidential election from prison and then try to pardon yourself. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=463.0s)]
*  And with this Supreme Court, who's to say he wouldn't get away with it? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=469.0s)]
*  There's no eject button for solving this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=472.0s)]
*  It is about accountability and we hope it is political accountability and people souring on this idea. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=475.0s)]
*  But the truth is a prerequisite and taking away the tools that he can use where other people commit other people commit crimes on his behalf. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=481.0s)]
*  That helps. But it all has to be done at once. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=489.0s)]
*  Yeah. The Eugene Debs tested the first part of that constitutionally running from president. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=491.0s)]
*  He didn't test the second because he didn't he didn't win on the Socialist Party line. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=496.0s)]
*  So that that is remains a sort of a question mark. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=501.0s)]
*  You just mentioned a hundred percent agree. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=504.0s)]
*  It was a great thing about Ultra 2 of just like the sort of different parts of what we call civil society, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=506.0s)]
*  That the law isn't some there's no civil bullet. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=511.0s)]
*  There's no panacea like for what makes a democracy work. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=513.0s)]
*  It's sort of endless toil and an effort by citizens to keep a democracy a democracy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=516.0s)]
*  The law is one component, but not the only one. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=520.0s)]
*  And I mentioned Eugene Carroll before. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=523.0s)]
*  But, you know, to me, this is a perfect example, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=526.0s)]
*  It's not like the Eugene Carroll verdict comes back and it's like, well, that's it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=528.0s)]
*  He's done. You know, like it probably means nothing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=532.0s)]
*  Republican primaries voters. And yet. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=536.0s)]
*  But it still really matters that that that happened. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=538.0s)]
*  And I haven't I'm just curious. I've gotten a chance to talk to you since that verdict came down. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=542.0s)]
*  What your reaction was to it? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=547.0s)]
*  I'll just tell you, I mean, first of all, I just think like when the the history of this era is written, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=552.0s)]
*  there are going to now be multiple chapters about Robby Kaplan, a lawyer given. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=558.0s)]
*  I mean, just in terms of the the the the lawyering here and the advocacy here and what Robby what else Robby Kaplan has done within the past 10 years. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=564.0s)]
*  Like, it's just it's it's going to be an important part of this moment in U.S. history. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=571.0s)]
*  This part of it. But I do think that you're right about the pain and the the the the trial, for lack of a better term, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=576.0s)]
*  that E.G. and Carol went through here in order to relive this, be attacked for it, put herself out there, go through this entire process, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnjd2_pqhEk&t=584.0s)]
