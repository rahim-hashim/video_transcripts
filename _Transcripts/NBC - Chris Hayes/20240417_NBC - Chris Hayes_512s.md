# Elizabeth Warren: Biden will go after tax cheaters. Trump won't.
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4)
*  Day two of Donald Trump's criminal trial and he didn't quite manage to get through [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=0.0s)]
*  the day without resting his eyes yet again. Those in the courtroom reporting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  that he periodically leaned back in his chair closing his eyes only to shift his [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=8.14s)]
*  weight moments later. Add any is difficult to say whether he fell asleep [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=12.1s)]
*  or is resting his eyes or maybe just silently praying. This is possibly the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=15.48s)]
*  most punishing ordeal for Trump to just sit down and shut up in a room where he [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=20.5s)]
*  has no control for like eight hours a day four days a week. A trial that will [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=24.38s)]
*  last for possibly two months. This is also time when Trump is not on the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=28.38s)]
*  campaign trail while his opponent is out campaigning. President Biden is doing a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=32.54s)]
*  three-day swing in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state where he is hammering [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=36.78s)]
*  home his economic message. People like Donald Trump learned very different [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  lessons. He learned the best way to get rich is inherited. Not a bad way. He [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  learned that paying taxes was something people who work for a living did not him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=54.22s)]
*  I guess that's how you look at the world when you're a park Avenue of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  When I look at the economy I don't see it through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago. I see [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=62.82s)]
*  through the eyes of Scranton and that's not hyperbole. That's a fact. Senator [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=67.34s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat of Massachusetts who serves on the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=71.82s)]
*  Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight and she joins me now. You know [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=74.3s)]
*  Senator we've been doing this series on my podcast about the sort of records of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=79.94s)]
*  the two men because it's the first time since 1892 when they both have records [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=83.7s)]
*  and I think one place where the record is just probably clearer than almost [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=87.26s)]
*  any other is on taxes, is on who gets tax cuts and who that affects and who [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=91.66s)]
*  benefits and who doesn't. Yep so look at it this way right. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=97.38s)]
*  Donald Trump actually had only two accomplishments in his four years and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=101.22s)]
*  one was the extremist Supreme Court that overturned Roe versus Wade and the other [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=105.14s)]
*  was more than two trillion dollars in tax cuts mostly soaked up by millionaires, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=111.3s)]
*  billionaires and giant corporations. Here's Joe Biden out there fighting to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=117.5s)]
*  make sure that we get access to abortion and other reproductive rights but on [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=123.06s)]
*  taxes watch the difference. Joe Biden actually got through a 15% minimum [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=128.18s)]
*  corporate tax on billionaire corporations and let me just remind [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=136.58s)]
*  everybody what that is. Remember how Amazon a couple of years back reported [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=141.46s)]
*  11 billion dollars in audited financials on their taxes on their profits and how [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  much did they pay in federal income taxes? Nothing and so what this bill what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=153.58s)]
*  this law is about is it says for those companies that make more than a billion [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  dollars in reported taxes they got to pay in reported profits they got to pay [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=165.02s)]
*  a minimum of 15% taxes and I want to just say one more thing that was the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  first tax increase on these big corporations in more than 30 years and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  it was used to fund the biggest climate package right in the history of the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=182.58s)]
*  world. So one of the things that is is interesting to me is so you've got a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  record here right there's the funding of the the American Rescue Plan and and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=193.1s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act and tax consequences you've got the big Trump [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=197.38s)]
*  tax cuts but there's a huge prospective issue which is 2025 right so I'm not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=202.66s)]
*  sure people are keyed into this but the 2025 like a big chunk of the Trump tax [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=208.42s)]
*  cuts expire that mostly benefit the people at the top and there's basically [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=213.54s)]
*  it's gonna we're gonna go one of two routes depending on who has control. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=219.02s)]
*  Yeah you come to the fork in the road take it because here's where this goes [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=222.74s)]
*  Donald Trump has said in rooms full of rich people just get him back in there [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=228.34s)]
*  and he is going to make sure that taxes are cut for the millionaires the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=234.78s)]
*  billionaires and the giant corporations. Joe Biden is headed in a very different [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=240.86s)]
*  direction he says he is going to raise taxes on the billionaires and he's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=247.18s)]
*  going to increase the minimum tax on the billionaire corporations and that he's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=253.06s)]
*  going to use that money to invest back in America and that is a huge difference [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=259.54s)]
*  between them. If I can there's one more contrast between the two and that is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=264.66s)]
*  tax cheats you know the people who make a lot of money and the law is perfectly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=271.14s)]
*  clear that they are supposed to pay but they cheat on their taxes. One of the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=276.53999999999996s)]
*  bones of contention over the last couple of years has been that Joe Biden and the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=282.06s)]
*  Democrats have actually funded the IRS so they can go after those millionaires [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=285.97999999999996s)]
*  and billionaires that cheat on their taxes and the consequence of that is to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=292.74s)]
*  actually make them start paying. That's something that President Biden wants to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  make long-term that's something that the Republicans and Donald Trump want to get [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=302.42s)]
*  rid of so it's partly about what the law says you have to pay and it's partly [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=306.98s)]
*  about who's going after the cheaters and Donald Trump and the Republicans who are [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=311.18s)]
*  saying cheat on your taxes if you're really really rich is fine with them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah and in case anyone thought that you were making up the promise from Donald [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump to play he was he said this to a huge high-dollar fundraiser for very [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=323.82s)]
*  very wealthy people here's what he had to say on taxes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=328.66s)]
*  You are all people that have a lot of money I know 20 of you and you're rich as hell. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna give you tax cuts, we're gonna pay off our debt, we're gonna do all of the things. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=338.82000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna do all the things we're gonna give you tax cuts and again just to go back to the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=344.82000000000005s)]
*  distributional can we show that chart again because I think it does actually [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=348.38s)]
*  it's really important for people to understand like those that's what it [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=350.86s)]
*  looked like the distributional effects of those Trump tax cuts and on just on [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=355.42s)]
*  this point on 2025 because I think I just want to zoom in on this a second [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=359.06s)]
*  this is really important for people understand they expire on their own [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  unless affirmatively extended right so the the kind of the default is on the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=367.42s)]
*  side of them going away which does create enormous incentive for people who [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=374.62s)]
*  are very wealthy and want to see a tax cut to try to get Donald Trump elected [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=378.5s)]
*  because it really will make an enormous amount of difference in a lot of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=382.74s)]
*  people's bottom line and billions and billions of dollars are on the line here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=387.02s)]
*  You know or another way to say that is taxes are gonna happen next year it is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=390.5s)]
*  going to be a huge there's going to be a tax bill one way or another right but [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=397.14s)]
*  because of this expiration right if the Republicans get to control the game then [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=402.26s)]
*  the answer is it's gonna be a payday for the people who are already rich and and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=407.98s)]
*  remember what that means everybody else has to pick up the slack so that's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=415.22s)]
*  everybody else who's gonna actually have to pay for all those roads and bridges [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=420.18s)]
*  that we need it's everybody else who's gonna have to pay to make sure that the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=425.62s)]
*  military is still paid it's everybody else who will have to pay because [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=430.18s)]
*  somebody like Jeff Bezos is paying taxes at a lower rate than a Boston public [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=436.22s)]
*  school teacher that's the kind of thing that's on the line and what Joe Biden is [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=442.46s)]
*  saying is give him a chance and what he's gonna do is he's gonna raise taxes [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=447.22s)]
*  for those at the very top reinvest that in America and he's gonna make sure that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=452.62s)]
*  the IRS has enough money to go after tax cheats so that just because they're rich [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=457.86s)]
*  and just because they can hire a bunch of lawyers doesn't mean they don't have [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=464.18s)]
*  to pay their taxes they got to pay like everyone else yeah that point about next [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=467.58s)]
*  year in the tax bill is such an important one it's a forcing mechanism [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=472.26s)]
*  it's happening it's a question of who controls it Senator Elizabeth Warren [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJSMNOtwL4&t=474.5s)]
