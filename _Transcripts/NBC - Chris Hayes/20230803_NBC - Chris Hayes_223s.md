# ‘Savvy’: How Jack Smith made it so Trump's Jan. 6 trial will likely go first
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU)
*  I think here's how it's gonna work. I think funny well says suggested that she's giving him some birth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=0.0s)]
*  She's not gonna go till toward the end of the month [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=6.76s)]
*  Alvin Bragg's done the same thing and I think obviously Jack Smith wants to bring this one before so as a practical matter and it's otherwise a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Logistical big challenge. I think we're gonna see this case built for speed happening first [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=17.32s)]
*  Oh, why though the number one aspect of this indictment to me that caption USA versus Donald Trump [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=22.6s)]
*  He could have had seven defendants here seven times the challenges. This one is built for speed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=29.92s)]
*  Built for speed special counsel. Jack Smith did something really savvy and I think under appreciated and unexpected [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=37.440000000000005s)]
*  In this new indictment for Trump's coup attempt. He charged a single defendant in the case Donald J. Trump [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  Despite that Trump is by no means the only person involved in this criminal conspiracy to steal the 2020 election [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=51.36s)]
*  You can look at the first few pages of the indictment where half a dozen [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=56.6s)]
*  Co-conspirators are listed with their actions to subvert American democracy detailed through many of the remaining 40 pages [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=60.64s)]
*  But recent legal actions taken by Smith's office imply he wants this case the January 6th case to go first [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=67.68s)]
*  So let me explain [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=75.12s)]
*  One week ago tonight. We were all expecting this indictment to come out of the Washington DC federal courthouse [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=76.76s)]
*  We were all on pins and needles, but instead Smith was focused on another case a thousand miles south in Miami [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=84.12s)]
*  That day he added a third defendant in the classified documents case [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=90.96s)]
*  He also released a superseding indictment adding new charges against the ex-president and the new defendant a Mar-a-Lago property manager [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=96.36s)]
*  This came out of nowhere as far as we knew it was completely unexpected and it was kind of strange because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=104.36s)]
*  What's that gonna do the case? It's gonna slow it down [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=110.16s)]
*  When you add a new defendant new charges it serves to tap the brakes on the trial date in the documents case [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=114.08s)]
*  I mean the new defendant Carlos de la Vera [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=119.56s)]
*  Had to be arraigned Trump and his co-defendant. Walt Nauta had to be rearranged because there are new charges [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=122.36s)]
*  And if that were not enough to push back the documents trial date yesterday [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=127.32s)]
*  Smith asked for a hearing to discuss potential conflicts of interest surrounding [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=131.96s)]
*  Walt Nauta's defense lawyer because he has represented at least seven other clients that have been interviewed in the classified documents case [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=136.56s)]
*  So take a step back looks the totality of what we have the Fulton County and New York prosecutors have signaled [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  They will defer to federal prosecutor on scheduling. Of course, Fonny Willis has not brought an indictment yet [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  We think that might be coming soon in the past week [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=154.84s)]
*  Smith has added a defendant in the classified documents case and requested a conflict of interest hearing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Both are things that slow down the pace of that case then Tuesday [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Smith indicts a single defendant Donald J [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Trump in the election subversion case does not indict the co-conspirators [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=171.0s)]
*  All of that shows Smith has all the pieces in place for this case the most important case to my mind by far [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=175.8s)]
*  critical to democracy for this case to go first [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=183.96s)]
*  Basically takes the timing of a first Trump federal trial a bit out of the hands of Mar-a-Lago judge Aiden Cannon [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=187.76s)]
*  Because of these reasons for delay and centers the focus on Washington DC [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  The fate of our democracy itself [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJE99mlYscU&t=198.56s)]
