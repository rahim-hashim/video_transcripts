# ‘Enraging’: Hayes slams lawmakers, billionaires for submitting to Trump in advance
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=0.0s)]
*  We are currently in something of a weird period these days, don't you think? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=2.5s)]
*  On one track, the daily news out of Washington is the normal process of American governance [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=7.0s)]
*  and specifically transition between different administrations. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=13.0s)]
*  It's the kind of thing you might expect after any election when the White House changes parties. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=16.0s)]
*  Elected Democrats are out there acting like everything is normal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=21.0s)]
*  You may recall that President Joe Biden hosted Trump for a friendly fireside chat in the Oval Office last month. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=26.0s)]
*  Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania made some news saying that he now supports Elise Stefanik [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=32.0s)]
*  to be Trump's U.N. ambassador because he supports her position on Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=37.0s)]
*  Democratic Governor Jared Polis of Colorado praised R.F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump's choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=42.0s)]
*  And a whole bunch of Democrats are paying lip service to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's fake department to slash spending by unprecedented levels. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=49.0s)]
*  From a lot of national Democrats, the message has been, well, the people spoke it, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=58.0s)]
*  and now we're going to get about the business of governing under Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=66.0s)]
*  And I kind of get it. I mean, all of this used to be very fairly standard stuff after an election, even a close election, very close election like this one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=69.0s)]
*  And there's also a very similar vibe from the titans of industry. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=77.0s)]
*  Tech billionaires are popping up all over the place trying to curry favor with the once and future president. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=81.0s)]
*  We just learned that Mark Zuckerberg's Metta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, donated a cool million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund after meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=86.0s)]
*  Not to be outdone, we're learning tonight that Jeff Bezos' company, Amazon, is also donating a million dollars to the inauguration. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=96.0s)]
*  Bezos also says he looks forward to working with Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=103.0s)]
*  If we're talking about Trump, I think it's very interesting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=106.0s)]
*  I'm I'm actually very optimistic this time around that we're going to see. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=110.0s)]
*  I'm very hopeful about this. His. He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=116.0s)]
*  And my point of view, if I can help him do that, I'm going to help him because we do have too much regulation in this country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=124.0s)]
*  By the way, after he said that an article out today that they're they're thinking about getting rid of the FDIC, which is the New Deal Institution that ensures bank deposits for everyone. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=131.0s)]
*  That's a regulation. Might say goodbye to that one. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=141.0s)]
*  Now, OK, in terms of Bezos and Zuckerberg and even Democrats, I have seen this movie before. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=144.0s)]
*  Right. Rich people currying favor with a powerful president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=153.0s)]
*  But the thing is that this isn't before and Trump is different. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=157.0s)]
*  I'm not imagining it and you're not. What is so disturbing, enraging, alienating about everyone who's doing this, the capitulation of Trump, is that it just fundamentally ignores the gaping wound in American democracy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=161.0s)]
*  A wound that is just sitting there festering while everyone just goes about business as usual. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=176.0s)]
*  One of the two major parties in this country, and we only have two, has withdrawn from the consensus of democratic governance that rejected the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=182.0s)]
*  Now, right now, it looks like that wound has been healed because the party that has withdrawn from that consensus, the Republicans, happen to win this last election. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=192.0s)]
*  And because Democrats really do believe in American democracy and preserving democracy, they accepted those results. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=203.0s)]
*  We didn't get a whole bunch of lawsuits. We didn't get a big lie. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=210.0s)]
*  We're certainly not rushing headlong towards a violent insurrection in the Capitol. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=214.0s)]
*  Right. So, hey, everything's fine. No, but the wound has not been healed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=219.0s)]
*  The problem has not been solved. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=224.0s)]
*  For one thing, Donald Trump, the incoming president, is just as committed to the big lie and the January 6 coup as he ever was. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=227.0s)]
*  For the sake of unifying this country, will you concede the 2020 election and turn the page on that chapter? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=235.0s)]
*  No. No. Why would I do that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=243.0s)]
*  You promised to pardon those who attacked the Capitol on January 6. Are you still vowing to follow through with that promise? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=245.0s)]
*  We're looking at it right now, most likely, yeah. I'm going to look at everything. We're going to look at individual cases, yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=253.0s)]
*  But I'm going to be acting very quickly. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=258.0s)]
*  Within your first 100 days, first day? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=262.0s)]
*  First day. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=264.0s)]
*  What's more, the incoming administration is instituting loyalty tests to make sure that the folks working in his administration, I mean, and that's hundreds, thousands of people, also support his election lies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=266.0s)]
*  A recent New York Times report details the interview process at the Trump transition offices. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=277.0s)]
*  Quote, the interviewers ask which candidate the applicants had supported in the three most recent elections, what they thought about the events of January 6, 2021, and whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=282.0s)]
*  The sense they got was that there was only one right answer for each question. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=294.0s)]
*  I laughed at that line in the article, like, what do you think of January 26, 2020? What's the right answer? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=298.0s)]
*  Like, cool, awesome. I love that one moment where they dragged the cop. They just started beating on him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=303.0s)]
*  For at least one of Trump's would-be employees, you don't even need to ask those questions. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=310.0s)]
*  You guys remember Carrie Lake? We're not done with her yet. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=315.0s)]
*  Carrie Lake is the person that Donald Trump wants to lead the voice of America, which, by the way, is the government's state media network. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=319.0s)]
*  It's the largest and oldest sort of public media in the country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=326.0s)]
*  She is the politician perhaps most closely linked to the big lie outside, of course, Trump himself. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=330.0s)]
*  Lake, get this, not only insists that Trump won the 2020 election, she also insists she won her own 2022 race to be governor of Arizona, which she didn't win. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=335.0s)]
*  She lost to Katie Hobbs. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=344.0s)]
*  The Democrat who beat Lake in Arizona's Senate race last month, again, she lost twice in two years, Ruben Gallego, compiled some helpful examples of her own big lie for voters. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=346.0s)]
*  I am the duly elected governor. Our victory was stolen from us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=357.0s)]
*  I want what I, what I earned. I want to be the governor of Arizona. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=360.0s)]
*  I am the governor. I believe I won. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=364.0s)]
*  They stole this election and every man, woman and child knows it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=366.0s)]
*  These bastards back there don't want us talking about stolen elections. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=369.0s)]
*  Will you accept the results of your election in November? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=373.0s)]
*  I'm going to win the election and I will accept that result. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=378.0s)]
*  That's actually a pretty good succinct articulation of the ethos, right, of Trump and Lake and all of them. If they win, they accept it. Otherwise, no. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=382.0s)]
*  Now, it's not exactly clear if Trump can actually install Lake as head of the VOA because there's like a board of governors, but he doesn't care. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=391.0s)]
*  He's certainly going to try and Lake would no doubt use every facet of her power to push election lies and kind of create a domestic version of Russia's infamous state media apparatus. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=398.0s)]
*  Lake believes, perhaps more than anyone else, in the core tenet of the Republican Party. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=408.0s)]
*  Elections only count when we win them. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=413.0s)]
*  And again, this is not isolated. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=416.0s)]
*  I can't stress enough. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=418.0s)]
*  We are actually seeing this play out in real terms legislatively right now in the state of North Carolina. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=419.0s)]
*  Last month, Trump won North Carolina at the top of the ticket. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=425.0s)]
*  But Democrats did pretty well down ballot. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=429.0s)]
*  Remember, Democrat Josh Stein won the gubernatorial race by 15 points, defeating Republican nominee Mark Robinson. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=431.0s)]
*  That was the guy who reportedly frequented a porn forum called Nude Africa, where he apparently referred to himself as a black Nazi. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=440.0s)]
*  Didn't go over great with the voters. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=447.0s)]
*  Robinson denies all that, by the way, but the voters seem to believe it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=449.0s)]
*  Anyway, there was also Democrat Jeff Jackson. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=453.0s)]
*  He's a congressman who was gerrymandered by the state Republicans out of his seat and then won the race to be the state's next attorney general. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=456.0s)]
*  Democrats won two of the top jobs in North Carolina politics. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=463.0s)]
*  Governor, attorney general, fair and square. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=466.0s)]
*  But North Carolina Republicans don't accept it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=468.0s)]
*  So they are pushing the state in this bizarre world, engaging in a kind of legislative coup in the lame duck session after the elections. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=471.0s)]
*  They lost their supermajority in the gerrymandered state legislature last month, a gerrymandered legislature they themselves created and was challenged often in court. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=478.0s)]
*  They're in a lame duck session right now. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=487.0s)]
*  Before that super majority goes away and in those waning days, having been voted out of office, they just overrode a governor's veto to force through a bill that strips power away from guess who? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=489.0s)]
*  Those newly elected Democrats, governor and attorney general, and hands it to guess who? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=500.0s)]
*  Republican officials instead. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=505.0s)]
*  They lost the election. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=509.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know, you shouldn't have maybe not nominated the nude Africa guy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=511.0s)]
*  But they lost and then they didn't accept it and they give themselves power anyway. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=517.0s)]
*  Believe you me, if they had lost the presidential race in November, where do you think we'd be right now? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=522.0s)]
*  Maybe having buddy buddy fireside chats? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=530.0s)]
*  They would be trying to steal the election at the national level too, obviously. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=533.0s)]
*  That's the gaping wound. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=538.0s)]
*  The rejection of this fundamental thing you kind of need an agreement on. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=540.0s)]
*  The rejection of democracy. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=545.0s)]
*  It's still there. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=546.0s)]
*  And Democrats keep kissing up to Trump or bending the knee because I don't know, they want to seem reasonable because they're spooked by the fact you want a majority and they don't they want to win over voters because they agree with him on [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=549.0s)]
*  Israel and supporting the Netanyahu government's claim to all the lamb between the river and the sea or they like the idea of cutting government spending. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=561.0s)]
*  Look, it's not going to address the problem. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=569.0s)]
*  My strong belief, and I've been wrong before, but my strong belief is that all these people, particularly Democratic leaders, trying to will us towards normalcy by acting like everything is normal are in for a rude awakening. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=574.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScchO0hM0gg&t=604.0s)]
