# Inside Trump’s courtroom nightmare ‘He has no power in there’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg)
*  Olivia Nuzzi is a Washington correspondent for New York magazine. She was inside that courtroom today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=0.0s)]
*  Christian Greenberg is a former deputy chief of the criminal division for the Southern District of New York. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=5.0s)]
*  She was inside the courtroom yesterday, and they both join me now. It's great to have you here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=9.0s)]
*  I want to just start working backwards from that ruling, the sort of last Hail Mary, up to the appellate court to get it delayed and the venue changed. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=13.0s)]
*  Did that have a chance at all, or was this like sort of like the many motions we've seen them file? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=21.0s)]
*  Just like the many motions. I mean, this idea that there's worse publicity in Manhattan than there is anybody anywhere else, you know, really doesn't doesn't make a whole lot of sense. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the 21st century. Like they're going to find you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=36.0s)]
*  And that was the argument they were making. But it does strike me just to stay on this for a second. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=39.0s)]
*  Again, I always ask this question like normal, not normal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=44.0s)]
*  This flurry of attempts to delay the trial to get at the venue moved, all this stuff we've seen over last week, like that's not standard practice, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=47.0s)]
*  No, I mean, look, there are pretrial motions to move venue. I've seen those and dealt with those. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=55.0s)]
*  But the fact that they keep coming every time you get shot down, you just keep saying reconsider, headed up to the next court. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=59.0s)]
*  Like, that's not normal. And that relates to the question I want to ask you, Olivia, someone who's covered Trump for a while now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=66.0s)]
*  You know, there are people in his circle who will say sometimes anonymously and sometimes names reporters as sort of like, bring it on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=72.0s)]
*  Like, he's going to look like a margarine. It'll be good for our fundraising. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=79.0s)]
*  And just everything seems like he really doesn't want to be there. Doesn't want this to happen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=82.0s)]
*  Clearly does not want to be there. I mean, when he walked in the room today, I've seen him in a lot of different settings. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=87.0s)]
*  I've seen him in the White House and Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, campaign trail, you name it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=91.0s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time with this man. And I was really not prepared for the sight of him in that courtroom today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=95.0s)]
*  It's this very drab space with this terrible lighting and it's all kind of neutrals. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=101.0s)]
*  And then he comes in in this in technicolor orange and with the golden hair and this kind of high blue suit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=106.0s)]
*  And he looks, I don't know, it's like a poppy flower or something in a desert. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=112.0s)]
*  And he it's so strange to see him in that context, but no power. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=116.0s)]
*  He kind of sprung up at the end of this hearing after his lawyer is just being completely reprimanded by the judge for these delay attempts. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=120.0s)]
*  And he sprung up when it was over and the judge promptly looked at him and said, sir, could you please sit back down? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=128.0s)]
*  He didn't call him Mr. President. There was no, you know, it was not overly polite. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=134.0s)]
*  And he had to, you know, sink back into the seat. He has no power in there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=138.0s)]
*  I mean, that really is. And again, the sort of physical bearing of him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=142.0s)]
*  And again, like this is all this is that we get. This is the nominee for one of the two major parties. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=147.0s)]
*  It's like it's like so wild to keep reminding yourself that because it doesn't. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=152.0s)]
*  But if it were anyone else, be like, wow, the slump shoulders, the clear exhaustion on his face, like he looks very defeated by the end of the day. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=156.0s)]
*  I thought initially I thought, oh, he's performing being very bored. Right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=163.0s)]
*  Who could be bored and fall asleep at their own criminal trial? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=166.0s)]
*  I mean, it seemed absurd to me. And then seeing him in there today on the way out, you could just see how exhausted he was. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=169.0s)]
*  He was sort of hobbling and looked like he'd just gotten off of a long haul flight or something. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=175.0s)]
*  And I just thought, how is he going to do this for the duration of this trial? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=179.0s)]
*  I want to say that he today he complained about the trial being both too fast and too long. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=183.0s)]
*  So he said that Judge Roshan is Roshan is railroading me at breakneck speed in order to completely satisfy his friends. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=190.0s)]
*  Additionally, he has gagged me so I cannot talk. This goes on forever and ever. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=198.0s)]
*  You can look it up and read it if you want to. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=202.0s)]
*  He also posted this trial is a long rigged endurance contest dealing with nasty, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=204.0s)]
*  and people who want to destroy our country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=210.0s)]
*  Maga 2024 on the pacing, it does seem like this week's jury selection happened quite expeditiously. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=212.0s)]
*  Well, when you got through each group of 96, at least 50 each time, we're saying we're out of this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=219.0s)]
*  We can't be fair and impartial. We don't want to sit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=225.0s)]
*  And so they were out. And then you took these groups of 18. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=227.0s)]
*  And once you got through the 42 questions that each of them have to be asked, that's tedious. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=230.0s)]
*  That takes some time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=234.0s)]
*  But then once you got through that, which would be a few hours, the strikes themselves happened pretty quickly. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=236.0s)]
*  So the fact that this has moved moved along, I think it has made a lot of sense. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=241.0s)]
*  It is pretty consistent with what you would see in a high profile jury case. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=246.0s)]
*  What do you think it will mean for Trump world to have him there every day for the next four weeks? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=249.0s)]
*  I just logistically he is running for president. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=257.0s)]
*  And we talked about this the other night, but the campaign and the court are sharing custody of him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=260.0s)]
*  His Wednesdays are free. His weekends are free, maybe, on Wednesdays. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=265.0s)]
*  And he's been planning rallies, I noticed, in the Tri-State area. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=270.0s)]
*  He has one in Wildwood, New Jersey on May 11th. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=274.0s)]
*  So they are preparing for the strange logistics of this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=277.0s)]
*  But I have to imagine he's also going to be very tired on days when he does not have court. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=280.0s)]
*  And how much stamina does he really have? I don't know. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=284.0s)]
*  I mean, again, just to reset the facts here, the man is 77 years old. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=287.0s)]
*  He will turn 78 by the time of the election. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=291.0s)]
*  And there's been so much talk about Joe Biden's age. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=293.0s)]
*  He's a 77 year old man sitting in courthouse, facing criminal charges for the first time in his life. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=296.0s)]
*  These are less than ideal conditions to do anything. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=302.0s)]
*  And he loves a busy schedule. He likes going to rallies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=304.0s)]
*  But he needs to feed off of a crowd of people who love him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=307.0s)]
*  He needs attention. He absorbs that. He comes out more energetic. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=310.0s)]
*  This is not that. This is the opposite of it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=313.0s)]
*  I mean, this is just like a pure energy sink. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=315.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the jury because we now have 12 jurors and six alternates. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=318.0s)]
*  What is your sort of impression? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=324.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts on how this jury's come together? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=326.0s)]
*  What the composition looks like? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=328.0s)]
*  Well, you have two lawyers on this jury. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=330.0s)]
*  And then you have, in addition, three individuals who say close family members, spouse, parents, in-laws are lawyers as well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=333.0s)]
*  So that's nearly half your jury of people who I would expect as a baseline have some respect for the law and have a sense of how it goes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=341.0s)]
*  I mean, even the people who are close family members, I'm guessing you have some experience with this, Chris, but lawyers when they go home tend to still talk about the law in their day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=350.0s)]
*  And so, you know, Pete, they have some sense of how this is supposed to work and that you respect the judge and listen to the judge's orders. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=357.0s)]
*  You would respect counsel. You'd respect a jury. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=364.0s)]
*  So if he starts acting up and being really disruptive, I think at a minimum those jurors are going to really not like it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=366.0s)]
*  On the other hand, you also have five women on this jury. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=373.0s)]
*  They're not going to like this case. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=377.0s)]
*  They're going to have the transcript of that Access Hollywood tape that, you know, you can do whatever you want. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=379.0s)]
*  They'll let you do whatever you want. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=385.0s)]
*  Grab them by the... [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=386.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=387.0s)]
*  They're going to hate that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=388.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember having a trial where the defendant had an extramarital affair and there were 11 women on the jury. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=389.0s)]
*  And when that evidence came out of that extramarital affair, you could see the look of disgust on those female jurors. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=396.0s)]
*  And like, that didn't go well for that defendant. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=402.0s)]
*  And I don't think this is going to go well for Donald Trump. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=404.0s)]
*  One of the things going into this trial is sort of question of it as, you know, spectacle, obviously. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=407.0s)]
*  And I actually think my sense is that it's relatively muted down there in the courthouse. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=411.0s)]
*  This has not been some completely chaotic frenzied scene. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=416.0s)]
*  And then, of course, today, the most horrific kind of disruption happened. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=419.0s)]
*  You were there during the courthouse. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=423.0s)]
*  Describe what happened. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=425.0s)]
*  I've been sharing the seat there with my colleague, Andrew Rice. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=427.0s)]
*  And I had just shown up when they were swearing in the jury. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=430.0s)]
*  And soon after, they were breaking for lunch. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=433.0s)]
*  And at that time, the news broke about what happened outside. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=436.0s)]
*  A man seemed to self-immolate. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=439.0s)]
*  But the courthouse is sort of just this really beautiful place. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=441.0s)]
*  You go there, and you kind of can't help but be overwhelmed by the stakes there [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=444.0s)]
*  and all these different facets of humanity coming together. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=450.0s)]
*  People were getting married on the corner. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=453.0s)]
*  And then to have something like that happen. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=455.0s)]
*  And in fairness, there's no indication, I don't think, that this was directly related to anything happening inside. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=457.0s)]
*  That this was in any way a protest. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=463.0s)]
*  I think it was a sort of, my sense from what we know, opportunistic because he knew there would be a lot of media. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=466.0s)]
*  And kind of a grab bag of different conspiracies from that manifesto, as far as I understand it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=472.0s)]
*  But the NYPD has done a pretty good job so far, both starting with the arraignment of keeping things controlled down there. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=477.0s)]
*  So it was pretty jarring to see it today turn into this gruesome scene. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=484.0s)]
*  And I've got to think also, just in terms of the jurors, I keep thinking about it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=490.0s)]
*  and keep finding myself sort of relatably empathizing with them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=494.0s)]
*  And I think that's just what this would be like. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=498.0s)]
*  Like, wildly upsetting scene. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=500.0s)]
*  I hope, you know, I don't know if people saw it on television, horrible. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=502.0s)]
*  But we already heard from jurors about how afraid their nerves are. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=505.0s)]
*  You've got to think, like, this is the last thing you want them encountering. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=508.0s)]
*  So I think that the court and law enforcement and security are figuring it out as they go. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=512.0s)]
*  On Monday, being in that line to get in, the jurors, there were like 50 or 60 jurors that were waiting to get in. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=518.0s)]
*  You could identify who they were because they're all holding their juror slips. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=524.0s)]
*  They're right across the park from loud Trump rallies. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=527.0s)]
*  And they're seeing all of this as they're nervously waiting to get inside. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=532.0s)]
*  I walked in yesterday and I just came off the elevator and unbeknownst to me, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=535.0s)]
*  I walked into a pool of potential jurors. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=540.0s)]
*  And, you know, I had to sit there and wait for them to go through security and not take any photos. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=542.0s)]
*  But they're not sequestered, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=547.0s)]
*  They're not sequestered. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=548.0s)]
*  But it does seem at least that I didn't see in subsequent days. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=549.0s)]
*  I didn't see them waiting for as long. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=552.0s)]
*  Coordinating it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=554.0s)]
*  It seems like they're trying to get the hang of this a little bit. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=555.0s)]
*  All right, Olivia Knutson, Mr. Greenberg, it's so great to have you both here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=558.0s)]
*  And thank you very much. Really appreciate it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBa0oy-wEAg&t=561.0s)]
