# Trump's right-hand guy The man behind Project 2025 and the MAGA dating app
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw)
*  Donald Trump really wants you to believe he has nothing to do with Project 2025, the 900-page [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=0.0s)]
*  wish list of far-right proposals should he win the presidency. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=6.88s)]
*  He has gone so far as to claim, quote, I have no idea who's behind it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=10.56s)]
*  One of the guys behind it is John McEntee, seen here holding Donald Trump's bag. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  McEntee used to be Trump's body man, basically personal assistant with him all the time, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  during the early years of the Trump administration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=24.28s)]
*  It did not end well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=27.0s)]
*  He was literally the man closest to the president. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=29.02s)]
*  Johnny McEntee, President Trump's personal assistant, his body man, abruptly forced out [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=31.38s)]
*  of his post and escorted off the White House grounds Monday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=36.38s)]
*  NBC News confirming McEntee is under investigation by the Secret Service for serious financial [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=39.34s)]
*  crimes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=44.94s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, McEntee was a habitual gambler, betting tens of thousands [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=45.94s)]
*  of dollars at a time and was deemed a security risk as a result. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=50.58s)]
*  Then Chief of Staff to the President John Kelly effectively had him tossed off the White [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=54.7s)]
*  House premises. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=58.940000000000005s)]
*  We should note he was not ever charged with a crime. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=60.34s)]
*  But in spite of it all, McEntee is nothing if not loyal to Donald Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=63.22s)]
*  Former college football player and Fox News production assistant was such a strong believer [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=67.86s)]
*  in Trump's message that back in 2015, he repeatedly cold emailed the Trump campaign, begging for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=71.86s)]
*  a job before the campaign eventually brought him on as a volunteer and then as a paid staffer. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=76.9s)]
*  McEntee was so committed to the cause that he worked out of this space in Trump Tower, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=82.02s)]
*  three walls and an unfinished floor. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=86.86s)]
*  And his loyalty to the boss paid off. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=89.46s)]
*  After Trump fired John Kelly, remember because he kept hiring people and then he would say [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  they're idiots and they're terrible and get rid of them, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=96.34s)]
*  So after he fired John Kelly, who's one of those people, as Chief of Staff, guess what? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=99.3s)]
*  He brought McEntee back, the guy that had been deemed a security risk, this time as, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=103.06s)]
*  wait for it, director of the presidential personnel office. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=108.14s)]
*  So basically, he was the guy who decides who gets to work for the president, the guy escorted [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=114.14s)]
*  off of the White House by Secret Service. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=119.02s)]
*  And in that role, McEntee worked to purge staffers deemed insufficiently loyal while [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=121.18s)]
*  ensuring that only the most rabid Trump toadies got jobs in the White House. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=126.14s)]
*  He was also deeply involved with Trump's attempted coup, including the efforts to pressure Mike [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=130.26s)]
*  Pence to reject the results of the 2020 election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=135.1s)]
*  With journalist John Karl calling him the man who made January 6th possible. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=138.06s)]
*  Now after that coup failed and they had to leave office, McEntee spun his notoriety into [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=143.66s)]
*  career of something of a conservative influencer selling Magamen, a conservatives only dating [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  app. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=153.46s)]
*  That sounds fun. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=154.46s)]
*  And posting absolutely deranged videos like this on social media. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=155.46s)]
*  So I always keep this fake Hollywood money in my car. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  So when a homeless person asks for money, then I give them like a fake $5 bill. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=164.54s)]
*  So I feel good about myself. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=168.94s)]
*  They feel good. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=170.14s)]
*  And then when they go to use it, they get arrested. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=171.42s)]
*  So I'm actually like helping clean up the community, you know, getting them off the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=174.26s)]
*  street. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so McEntee says that was a joke. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  A weird one. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=182.78s)]
*  Gross, I think. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=184.82s)]
*  Why are we talking about John McEntee? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=187.7s)]
*  Well, here's why. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=189.34s)]
*  That guy is a senior advisor of Project 2025. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=190.94s)]
*  Specifically, he's an advisor to the Presidential Personnel Database. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=195.1s)]
*  That is a project to staff the White House in the event Trump wins in November, which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=199.98s)]
*  means the grifting, gambling Jan 6 henchman, who is too much of a security issue for the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=204.26s)]
*  Trump administration, is going to be the guy vetting resumes the second time around. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=210.06s)]
*  Is that someone you want in charge of the most important personnel office? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=216.98s)]
*  In the country? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEpNwehw5Aw&t=220.76s)]
