# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 17
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Wednesday. It's Wednesday, which must be Donald Trump's favorite day of the work week, because his New York criminal trial for election interference is not in session. Not on Wednesday. So on Wednesdays, he does not have to sit in a courtroom for eight hours where he must be quiet and cannot control what happens. And on Wednesdays, he does not have to listen as his lawyers and the judge read into the record the various nasty things that people say about him out in the real world. Because that's exactly what happened in Judge Juan Marchand's Manhattan courtroom yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, again, for any American, I think other than Trump himself, like negative talk about Donald Trump posts on social media is the most mundane thing imaginable. The fact of the matter is he's polarizing and he is unpopular. Those two things are true about him. More people dislike him than like him by a margin of nearly 12 percent, though that's been higher in the past. It's nothing new. And again, both in 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump lost the popular vote in this big, great, complicated country of ours by a significant margin. By 2.8 percent. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=30.0s)]
*  By 8 million votes in 2016. By 7 million votes in 2020. Neither election was that close, to be totally honest. In off-year elections, Trump has displayed what Vanity Fair calls losing touch with Trump endorsed candidate after candidate going down. But because of that one victory in 2016, enabled by the anti-democratic quirk of our electoral system, many people grew to believe, and this narrative persists, that there's some small set of elites that dislike Donald Trump, the real folks love him. And that perception just kind of exploded. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=60.0s)]
*  In a place where the realest of real people congregate. Where else can you find a cross-section of everyone registered to vote, holding a driver's license or paying income tax in a particular region, then in a jury room in a courthouse? This week in Manhattan Criminal Court, hundreds of real people reported for jury duty, as is their constitutional civic privilege in duty, where many of them were considered for the very first trial of an ex-president. A bunch of them told the court up front, there's no way I could serve on this jury. There's no way I could do it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=90.0s)]
*  There's no way I could be impartial about this man. Others who made it through the initial rounds of questioning, who said, I think I can do it, I think I'd be impartial, then had their social media posts about the former president read aloud into the official record, as they and Trump sat and listened. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=120.0s)]
*  It went something like a late night Jimmy Kimmel mean tweets skit. Here are just a few examples taken straight from the court transcript. Quote, good news, Trump lost his court battle and his unlawful travel ban. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=137.0s)]
*  Get him out and lock him up. Watch out for stupid tweets by DJT. Posts also included memes like one described by Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche, quote, as a picture of President Obama and President Trump and it says, I don't think this is what they meant by Orange is the New Black. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=148.0s)]
*  Another juror Blanche said posted a one minute and 30 second AI generated video titled, I'm dumb as F, Trump 2024. Of course, there were some people in the jury pool who appeared to support Donald Trump too, like the man who told the judge that he would love to serve for New York and one of our great presidents. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=163.0s)]
*  Couldn't, he's got a job he's got to go to. And that man too, representative of real people, Americans, a county in fact, Manhattan, New York County, New York, New York, where 85,000 people voted for Donald Trump in 2020 out of 700,000. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=182.0s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump had to sit through yesterday. Now keep in mind, this is a person whose entire life in some ways revolves around a sick and destructive desire for praise, as well as revenge against those who dare to say anything negative about him. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=197.0s)]
*  That desire is so strong that he has an ever present aid who reportedly follows Trump around with, and I'm quoting here because it's almost not believable, a wireless printer to provide him with an ongoing stream of good news from the internet. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=210.0s)]
*  Presumably she followed him to the bodega in Harlem yesterday after a long day in court, where it would not be crazy to suspect that Trump's staff might have instigated these chants among the crowd. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=223.0s)]
*  Yes, Harlem bodega is infamous for the spontaneous Trump crowds that break out into four more year chance. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=239.0s)]
*  Trump's fragile ego is further on display today in a social media rant against Jimmy Kimmel, who slighted him at the Oscars last month after Trump attacked him. Remember he did that thing mid performance. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=261.0s)]
*  And according to Trump, quote, stupid Kimmel still hasn't recovered from his horrendous performance, especially when he showed he suffered from TDS, commonly known as Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=271.0s)]
*  He then went on to confuse Jimmy Kimmel with Al Pacino for like four more paragraphs in that post, which was now anyone will tell you and I'll be the first to admit, of course, Manhattan is not exactly representative of all America. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=281.0s)]
*  But again, it's also home to like well over a million real actual people, real American citizens and all of our diversity and complexity and people who do not like Donald Trump or every bit as American as those who do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=294.0s)]
*  In fact, and again, obvious point, but understated, they are the majority. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=306.0s)]
*  As the first two days of the first ever criminal trial before our president has reminded us on Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in an appeal from a former Pennsylvania police officer named Joseph Fisher, who was charged with multiple crimes for shoving his way into the Capitol on January 6. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=311.0s)]
*  You can see in there doing just that in a blue ball cap. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=330.0s)]
*  He was charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, which in this case, of course, the congressional certification of the 2020 election. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=333.0s)]
*  Hundreds of others have been charged or convicted of that as well. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=341.0s)]
*  And he wants that felony charge dismissed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=344.0s)]
*  And the conservative majority of justices sounded skeptical of the charge and sympathetic to Fisher's argument that that obstruction law should only apply to evidence tampering and not say a congressional proceeding to certify the law. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=347.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=360.0s)]
*  Hundreds of accused and convicted insurrections have been charged with this particular obstruction charge. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=361.0s)]
*  And so was Donald Trump. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=366.0s)]
*  And the court appeared to hold in oral arguments yesterday a sudden concern about the First Amendment right to peaceably assemble the possible use of this statutory charge by the government to overreach and criminalize it, which itself would be a perfectly legitimate concern. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=368.0s)]
*  If it weren't for the fact that on Monday, the day before those very same oral arguments, the same Supreme Court once again acted by not acting and allowed a lower court ruling to stand that would effectively make it legally impossible to organize protests in three states, particularly black lives matter protests. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=384.0s)]
*  In that case, a Louisiana police officer was injured by a protester, and he sued the man who he said organized the protest. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=403.0s)]
*  And a federal court of appeals found that an organizer could basically be sued into ruination if a single protestee protester commits an illegal act. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=412.0s)]
*  The man who police say organized the protest in question was to Ray McKesson and Dora McKesson, whose name is on that to civil rights organizer, Black Lives Matter activists also hosted the podcast. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=423.0s)]
*  Pod save the people joins me now. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=433.0s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=435.0s)]
*  It's good to be here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=436.0s)]
*  So I just want to sort of walk people through this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=437.0s)]
*  This was a protest in Baton Rouge, I believe, right in 2016 after the killing of Alden Sterling. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=439.0s)]
*  And you were, I imagine, one of a bunch of people that were organizing protests, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=444.0s)]
*  I wasn't organizing it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=450.0s)]
*  I was just out there supporting people. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=451.0s)]
*  I was tweeting about it, giving people to come in terms of Twitter, but I was not one of the organizers. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=453.0s)]
*  We've repeatedly said this in all of the legal documents. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=458.0s)]
*  You're just like a person who is protest. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=462.0s)]
*  I was out there supporting the protests and I was actually arrested pretty quickly. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=463.0s)]
*  It was the photo that you had up. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=468.0s)]
*  So I was in jail for 17 hours. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=469.0s)]
*  So I was as shocked as anybody to get charged with this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=471.0s)]
*  But I was actually sued by five police officers. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=474.0s)]
*  We got them all dismissed, including this one. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=476.0s)]
*  They appealed and then we lost an appeal. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=479.0s)]
*  So I've been dealing with this loss on appeal since 2016. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=481.0s)]
*  And I just want to be really clear here because there's some pretty firm precedent, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=485.0s)]
*  Like it cannot be the case that you could have a functioning First Amendment with the right to peaceably assemble and the right to have protests. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=490.0s)]
*  If any police officer who happens to be injured by one person at that protest could then say that this other person is civilly liable for that injury, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=497.0s)]
*  which is the theory of this police officer and which the Supreme Court in past precedent has said no, that it doesn't work that way. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=508.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a historic case in NAACP versus Claiborne that says that you can't sue a protest organizer if somebody else just commits an act of violence or destruction. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=514.0s)]
*  What is wild about my case is that we've never actually had a trial or a fact finding. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=524.0s)]
*  The court has to take his allegations as fact. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=528.0s)]
*  So the idea that I actually organize it, they have to take as fact, right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=531.0s)]
*  Did he even get hurt? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=534.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=535.0s)]
*  We've never, he's never produced anything to say their action was an injury. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=536.0s)]
*  But this is just about that threshold legal issue. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=539.0s)]
*  Like, do we want to open the door? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=541.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=543.0s)]
*  And there's other examples too. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=544.0s)]
*  In 2023, the court had another case, this counterman case, which Sotomayor talks about in her note, saying, wait a second, we already have court precedents saying this is nonsense. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=546.0s)]
*  This is other findings. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=558.0s)]
*  So like, it seems to me you've got a real rogue Fifth Circuit here that is opening a very dangerous door for peaceful protest. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=559.0s)]
*  And remember that this case, we went to the Fifth Circuit twice. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=566.0s)]
*  We got split opinions both times. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=569.0s)]
*  We went to the Supreme Court twice. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=571.0s)]
*  This is actually the second time at the court. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=573.0s)]
*  The first time the Supreme Court said, we need to ask Louisiana State Supreme Court if you can be sued. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=574.0s)]
*  So we go to Louisiana. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=579.0s)]
*  They say, yes, I can be sued. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=581.0s)]
*  We're like, well, that's not good. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=582.0s)]
*  So then we come back to the Supreme Court. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=583.0s)]
*  And thankfully, Sotomayor's statement makes it so that it'll be very hard to apply the Fifth Circuit's logic in the decision they made about my case. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=586.0s)]
*  So that is a good thing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=596.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=597.0s)]
*  You seem confident at the lower court level. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=598.0s)]
*  This is like basically temporary. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=600.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=602.0s)]
*  We think that Sotomayor's statement is actually going to make it impossible to enforce what the Fifth Circuit did. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=603.0s)]
*  We also feel confident that we're going to actually win my case when we actually go to court and that people should not be nervous to protest in these three states. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=608.0s)]
*  The ACLU has said that they will represent people if somebody, if another officer does try to invoke the Fifth Circuit decision. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=615.0s)]
*  But we are thankful that Sotomayor's note actually does sort of make it really hard to apply. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=621.0s)]
*  We wish it had been a more forceful summary reversal. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=627.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=630.0s)]
*  The court should have stepped in and been like, this is wildly out of line with our precedent. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=631.0s)]
*  It got me listed five times. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=635.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a wild case. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=636.0s)]
*  It is a wild case. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=638.0s)]
*  And I mean, eight years on the notion in the face of all precedent and all logic about the First Amendment and the importance of civil disobedience and protest in this country's history to create this liability standard is just, I mean, the implications of it are bizarre. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=639.0s)]
*  And to get caught up, you know, I'm thankful that the ACLU supported me. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=656.0s)]
*  David Goldberg, Billy, all the lawyers have been incredible. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=659.0s)]
*  But the sheer amount of time and energy it has been to like turn over the text messages. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=662.0s)]
*  I got deposed in this case. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=666.0s)]
*  But the district court case got put on hold because we're waiting for the Supreme Court. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=667.0s)]
*  But now we have to go back to district court in Baton Rouge. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=671.0s)]
*  This is part of both sort of the lawsuit itself, the Fifth Circuit's logic to the extent, the fact that the Supreme Court didn't step in to proactively say this is nonsense. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=673.0s)]
*  It seems all the piece with a lot of backlash against protests we've seen from the right. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=682.0s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you about Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who's talking about people protesting the war in Gaza who are stopping traffic, who place themselves and basically said you should take matters into your own hands. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=687.0s)]
*  He also said that they may have to have their skin ripped off if they were glued to something. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=700.0s)]
*  What does it do to American democracy to have prominent folks like that in prominent positions with their sights on protesters in this way? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=704.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think their intent is to have a chilling effect so people won't go to the street. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=713.0s)]
*  The good news is that there's a long history of civil disobedience in this country that the civil rights movement, I think about 2014. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=717.0s)]
*  It's going to be 10 years since the protests in Ferguson that birthed a movement, a generation of people come into the streets. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcRZDLtUDD4&t=723.0s)]
