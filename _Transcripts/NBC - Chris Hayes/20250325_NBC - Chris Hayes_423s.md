# 'Unheard of': Slotkin says Trump war plans breach endangers 'human beings'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk)
*  Senator Alyssa Slockin is a Democrat of Michigan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=0.0s)]
*  She previously served as a CIA analyst [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=2.72s)]
*  and as the Assistant Secretary of Defense [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=5.08s)]
*  for International Security Affairs at the Pentagon, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=8.24s)]
*  Senator, it's great to have you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=10.08s)]
*  I want to just start with this, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=11.84s)]
*  which I think personally strikes me [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  as a preposterous thing to say, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=15.92s)]
*  but the current line is that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=18.16s)]
*  there was no classified information [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=20.0s)]
*  shared on that chat message. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=22.96s)]
*  Is that credible, plausible to you? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=25.3s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, first of all, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=27.94s)]
*  we already had Mr. Walz apologize [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=31.18s)]
*  just a few minutes ago on Fox News. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=33.82s)]
*  So if there's nothing wrong, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=35.660000000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure why he's taking full accountability [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=36.900000000000006s)]
*  for what happened. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=40.38s)]
*  But look, based on what we have, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=41.86s)]
*  when you provide operational details [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=44.36s)]
*  on the movements of U.S. forces [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  in a dangerous, violent theater, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=48.92s)]
*  when you talk about specific weapons, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=51.1s)]
*  specific times for an assault, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=53.02s)]
*  specific sequencing of an assault, of an action, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=55.78s)]
*  that is inherently very dangerous [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=59.98s)]
*  for the troops on the ground, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=62.82s)]
*  for the troops on the ships [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=63.82s)]
*  who are trying to perform this operation, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=65.62s)]
*  and it puts them at risk [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  and therefore is considered classified information. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  I've never seen it any other way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=71.86s)]
*  Now we need to see the full conversation, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=73.62s)]
*  We've seen it gisted. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=76.1s)]
*  We've heard a few more details today, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=77.82s)]
*  so that's why we need to see it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=79.34s)]
*  But I think the conversation, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=81.3s)]
*  I just wanna make sure we don't lose [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=82.9s)]
*  why this is such a big deal, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  I'm a CIA officer by training. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=87.94000000000001s)]
*  U.S. military, it is drilled into you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=90.5s)]
*  that you do not provide sensitive or classified information [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  on an unclassified phone. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=96.26s)]
*  I mean, you can't even bring your phone [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=98.34s)]
*  into your workplace, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=99.7s)]
*  I mean, CIA, you don't bring it into the office. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=101.42s)]
*  You keep it in a lead box outside [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=104.18s)]
*  if you even bring it in the building. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  So why? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=107.84s)]
*  Why are we so protective? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  Why do we train everyone who comes in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=110.42s)]
*  to be so careful? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=113.5s)]
*  Because there are human beings who can lose their lives [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=114.34s)]
*  on the other side of this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=116.7s)]
*  And I think, I don't want that to be lost [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=118.3s)]
*  in kind of the he said, she said. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=120.22s)]
*  We have a bunch of U.S. forces being moved [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=122.94s)]
*  into the area around Yemen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=125.94s)]
*  They're leaving their families. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=128.74s)]
*  Many of them were just extended. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=130.02s)]
*  They were supposed to be coming home at the end of April. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  They just were told that now it's gonna be August. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=133.22s)]
*  And then they see this story, right? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=136.22s)]
*  And I've been hearing from a lot of spouses today, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=138.34s)]
*  a lot of family members of folks who are on those missions [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  who are just like, are you kidding me? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=144.94s)]
*  We are told we can't even talk to our kids [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=146.38s)]
*  about where our loved ones are for operational security. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  And you're putting this out as the secretary of defense. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=152.48s)]
*  So as far as I concern, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=156.33999999999997s)]
*  the spouses have better operational security [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=158.14s)]
*  on their Facebook groups than the secretary of defense has [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=160.5s)]
*  in providing that to our adversaries [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=164.5s)]
*  or anyone who has the ability to hack him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=167.06s)]
*  You know, there's one other piece of information [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=170.3s)]
*  that struck me of sort of a similar category [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=173.3s)]
*  in terms of that like true, like if you were ranking, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=176.1s)]
*  what's the most sensitive stuff? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=179.74s)]
*  It's like battle plans and troop movements [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=181.06s)]
*  and the names of covert intelligence operatives. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=183.5s)]
*  It's sort of the top two. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=187.7s)]
*  Here's Jeffrey Goldberg talking about an instance [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=188.78s)]
*  I think of the latter, take a lesson. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=191.26s)]
*  There's a covert CIA operative named on the threat, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=194.26s)]
*  Well, yes, and I withheld her name from this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=198.06s)]
*  They named somebody who's an active CIA officer [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=201.61999999999998s)]
*  in this thread, which is on Signal again, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=204.98s)]
*  a commercial app in which I'm watching. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  You know, and I withheld it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  I didn't put it in the story because she's under cover. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  But I mean, the CIA director put it into the chat. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  Seems like that's in a similar category. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as a former CIA officer, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=225.2s)]
*  like, you know, I wasn't undercover. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=227.55999999999997s)]
*  If you are undercover, your name is everything, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, literally, you blow your cover. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=233.64s)]
*  And then the ability for that person [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  to serve overseas again, the ability for that person [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  to recruit assets again, to do their work overseas [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=240.44s)]
*  is blown. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=243.48s)]
*  I mean, people don't get, you know, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=244.32s)]
*  to just sort of go anywhere they want. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=246.04s)]
*  And I think the idea that a director of the CIA [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  who knows this better than anybody or should, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=251.44s)]
*  would put their name into a chat on a phone, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=254.2s)]
*  again, just I imagine what would happen to someone like me [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=257.56s)]
*  as a young CIA officer if I had done the exact same thing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=261.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=264.68s)]
*  It's very clear. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=265.52s)]
*  And the idea that they've been deflecting all day, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=267.04s)]
*  they've been saying in testimony, right? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=270.92s)]
*  That nothing happened here, nothing to see here [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=273.36s)]
*  is completely disingenuous. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=275.92s)]
*  And I think, again, you know, it's a back and forth. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=277.84s)]
*  We know these very same officials have said, you know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=283.56s)]
*  crazy things about what other people should be doing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  because of alleged security breaches, you know, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  the Hillary Clinton's of it all. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=291.24s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  this is about the security and safety [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=294.44s)]
*  of the people they represent, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=296.0s)]
*  and they need to take accountability for that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=297.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, let me ask you about that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=299.8s)]
*  I mean, what, presumably, what would happen to you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=301.36s)]
*  as a CIA analyst or if you were in, you know, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=303.24s)]
*  you were just a Marine, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=307.68s)]
*  you would be either disciplined or fired. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, there are people, Hakeem Jeffries has said [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=311.68s)]
*  that Pete Hegseth should resign or be fired. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=314.24s)]
*  There are people who think that Michael Walz, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=316.8s)]
*  who created the group to begin with, should be fired. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=318.12s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=321.16s)]
*  Well, I think I wanna see the actual transcript, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, they should provide the entire thing to Congress. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  That's exactly what they would be asking for [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  if it was a Democratic administration. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  Let's see it, because right now, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=333.0s)]
*  I've got it gisted from a journalist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=334.32s)]
*  I wanna see the black and white of it all. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  But then, again, at the Pentagon especially, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=339.32s)]
*  leadership climate is set at the top. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=341.96s)]
*  If a commanding general is doing something bad, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=344.88s)]
*  you can bet dollars to doughnuts [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  that a lieutenant is doing something bad. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=349.44s)]
*  Climate is set at the top. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=351.36s)]
*  So what is Hegseth gonna say to all of the, you know, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=352.6s)]
*  officers and enlisted that he is the boss of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=356.08s)]
*  in terms of handling classified information? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  How is he gonna hold them to a high standard [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=361.8s)]
*  when he can't even accept responsibility [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  for what he's done? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think there's a real crisis of leadership. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=366.92s)]
*  I'm glad Mike Waltz took responsibility. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to put it on him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=373.56s)]
*  But the truth is, as I read that chat, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  Mike should have never started that chain, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=378.72s)]
*  but the Secretary of Defense should never [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  put operationally sensitive details [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=383.68s)]
*  in an open, unclassified forum like that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=385.68s)]
*  It's like, it's absolutely unheard of. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=387.76s)]
*  Yeah, the thing you said about spouses on Facebook groups [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=390.32s)]
*  and what their responsibility is to OPSEC [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=394.36s)]
*  is really gonna stick with me. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=397.2s)]
*  So thank you for spending a little time with us [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=398.2s)]
*  tonight, Senator, appreciate it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=400.36s)]
*  You bet, you bet. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4gNX8gLtEk&t=402.0s)]
