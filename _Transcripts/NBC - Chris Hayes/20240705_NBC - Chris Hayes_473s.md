# Dem Rep. Mike Quigley calls on Biden to step aside 'Let someone else do this'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4)
*  Joining me now, Congressman Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, how you doing? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=3.4s)]
*  I've been better after watching all this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=5.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, what do you think? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=7.88s)]
*  It was a horrible night. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=10.6s)]
*  The debate. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=11.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=12.6s)]
*  And everything's not OK. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=13.6s)]
*  I know people, this instinct is to be loyal, and I appreciate that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=16.2s)]
*  I know their instinct is to be a cheerleader, but that's not helpful. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=20.64s)]
*  We need folks who are willing to understand where we are and what we have to do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=25.56s)]
*  And that is extraordinarily difficult. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  But you do it under the specter of a second Trump term, right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=33.96s)]
*  And I was in the room on January 6th. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=39.4s)]
*  The second Trump term is a continuation of the last days of his first term, which is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=41.4s)]
*  a nightmare in every respect. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=48.4s)]
*  So I don't think they're helping anyone. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=50.56s)]
*  Who's they? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think there are those who cheer on and think, oh, everything's going to be [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  OK with where President Biden is. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=56.68s)]
*  This is hard to do. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  I would rather be doing anything else. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  I'd rather be out in the Midwest talking to diaspora about what a second Trump term means [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=63.76s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  You have been probably, I would say, the most strenuous advocate on behalf of the Ukrainian [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  people in the U.S. Congress. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=74.52s)]
*  Your district has a huge part of the Ukrainian diaspora. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=77.36s)]
*  It's something you feel deeply about. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=79.4s)]
*  It's extraordinary because I know what happened. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  Last time I was in Ukraine, we met with President Zelensky and we were in villages 50 miles [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  from the Russian border where they had been occupied. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=92.08s)]
*  And they said to us after going through that hell, they said, if you leave, the Russians [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=95.24s)]
*  will be back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=99.6s)]
*  First day at office, Trump pulls all support out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=101.24s)]
*  And this is all but done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  OK, so those are the stakes, both for American democracy, for Ukrainian democracy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=106.52s)]
*  So what do you think should happen? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=111.44s)]
*  Raul Grohova, Seth Moulton and Lloyd Doggett of Texas have explicitly said on the record [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=113.4s)]
*  they think the president should step aside and allow someone else to run. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=118.92s)]
*  Do you agree with them? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=121.4s)]
*  I started the week doing an interview where I was talking about everything else. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=123.68s)]
*  And then this came up and I asked for help to get the words out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=126.88s)]
*  And I couldn't help because it's like talking to a loved one about such a tough situation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=131.76s)]
*  A man who pulled us out of COVID, who pulled us out of an autocracy, who did so many great [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=137.36s)]
*  things, how do you tell that person he can't do this anymore? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=143.28s)]
*  So the way I started it was by thanking him, showing them that deference and suggesting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=147.52s)]
*  that his decision isn't just going to affect who sits in the White House for the next four [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=153.12s)]
*  years, but who controls the House and the Senate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=158.68s)]
*  These races are razor thin, those front line seats. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=161.36s)]
*  And of course the Houses and the Senate are decided by single digits and all these critical [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=165.84s)]
*  votes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  Everyone cares so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  So I would say to those folks who say everything's fine, it's not. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=172.28s)]
*  And everything you care about is on the line and you have to be realistic and you have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=177.28s)]
*  to be tough. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  So the way I say this has probably changed since that day, just because I've had time [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=183.16s)]
*  to accept this and look at the polls. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=188.2s)]
*  And if I talked to the president, I would say something different. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  So you didn't answer the question. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=195.12s)]
*  Do you agree with Roel Grajava, Lloyd Doggett and Seth Moulton? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=196.12s)]
*  The president should step aside. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=199.0s)]
*  I had a hard time processing getting to that point with him as I think anybody would who [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=200.0s)]
*  respects him so much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  I would say, Mr. President, your legacy is set. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=206.72s)]
*  We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=211.0s)]
*  The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=213.52s)]
*  is to step down and let someone else do this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=220.62s)]
*  I think day one, we're back in a dogfight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=223.64s)]
*  All of a sudden, all the things we're talking about with President Biden, we've got a lot [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=227.32s)]
*  more we can talk about with Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Not just that he lied 28 times during the debate and that he's an absolute monster, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=235.62s)]
*  but he has cognitive issues, something that Speaker Emeritus Pelosi brought up earlier [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=240.2s)]
*  this week. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=245.2s)]
*  She's absolutely right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=246.2s)]
*  So one of the arguments that other folks have made, and again, I think I've been pretty [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=247.64s)]
*  honest about this, you're talking about working your way through this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=252.48s)]
*  I feel somewhat similarly differently because I'm a journalist. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=255.16s)]
*  I'm not an elected member, but I have a deep stake in the prospering of American democracy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=258.92s)]
*  and its continuation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=263.84s)]
*  The idea of the chaos that lies on the other side of that decision, that it would rip the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=266.7s)]
*  Democratic Party apart, what do you think about that? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=270.56s)]
*  There's a process to do this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  When we were trying to win in 2020, it was like, oh, we're going to be torn apart. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=277.12s)]
*  I think people came together and made a very collectively pragmatic decision. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  In those primaries, they were going to be with Joe Biden because he had the best chance [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=287.44s)]
*  to beat Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=291.6s)]
*  They were right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  They did it, and it worked. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=294.14000000000004s)]
*  So that was chaotic. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  That was difficult. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  We didn't think we were going to get there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  We're in a situation, ironically, it involves Joe Biden, the opposite scenario, where he [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  can't be the person who's at the top of the ticket. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=304.32s)]
*  So look, I don't think there's anything wrong with having people intensely disagree with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=307.76s)]
*  how we get to that point. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=313.08s)]
*  But I think for the same reasons they came together four years ago, they will come together [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=314.64s)]
*  this time behind one candidate. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think people underrate the bench. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=321.08s)]
*  I think we have a lot of people who are great. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=323.52s)]
*  I have the greatest respect for the vice president. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=325.08s)]
*  So I think we can get beyond all that stuff. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=328.48s)]
*  But clearly, the alternative now is a very bleak scenario with, I would say, almost no [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  help of succeeding. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=338.5s)]
*  It doesn't just affect the White House. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=340.22s)]
*  It affects all of Congress and our future. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=342.5s)]
*  Let me just follow up on that because there's some, you know, I think the Biden people, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=345.54s)]
*  and I use that moment in the intro intentionally, you know, they're sort of in 2020 looked like [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=350.42s)]
*  he was done for after New Hampshire. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=354.82s)]
*  There's been a few moments we've talked about them, Trump after Access Hollywood, where [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=357.42s)]
*  I think every if you went up to anyone who's a political practitioner, they'd be like, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=361.1s)]
*  the guy's been toast. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=364.42s)]
*  He's done. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=365.42s)]
*  He wasn't right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=366.42s)]
*  So there's some sense in which there's some part of me sympathetic to the argument of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=367.82000000000005s)]
*  like, don't get caught up in the moment. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=372.54s)]
*  Things can change this like don't don't get to because you don't you never know what's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=374.18s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=378.86s)]
*  Does that weigh on you at all? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=379.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  But look, a lot of pressure here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  That's why it took time to get here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=383.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=385.06s)]
*  But four years ago, you saw a different Joe Biden. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=386.06s)]
*  I think that's uncontroversial. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy2pu7a0h4&t=387.94s)]
