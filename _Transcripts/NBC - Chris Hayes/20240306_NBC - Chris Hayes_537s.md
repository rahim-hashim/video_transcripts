Video Description: Chris Hayes is joined by Alex Wager and Rachel Maddow to discuss the kickoff of the rematch between Biden and Trump. "There's one thing that is a very clear choice in this election, and it is between having a democracy and not," says Maddow. "If you can get people to accept that basic idea, which is a popular front idea—I do think that you can get there over the next eight months."

# Maddow: This election is a choice ‘between having a democracy and not’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4)
*  Eric Levitz wrote an interesting piece in New York Magazine where he says, you get all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=0.0s)]
*  this demographic freak out on the right about they're importing voters. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=3.4s)]
*  So that's fucking ... And it's like, I don't think those people coming over necessarily [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=7.68s)]
*  are even going to vote against it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=12.08s)]
*  You are doing more sort of stereotyping of how people might vote that has actually worked. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, you might be able to build a multiracial right-wing movement in America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=21.44s)]
*  Imagine if you weren't talking about internment camps. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=26.32s)]
*  Just imagine what you could do if you really put your mind to it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=29.04s)]
*  But I mean, I think that first of all, it's been really under-reported, the way in which [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  disinformation has really grown and spread on Spanish language media. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=35.58s)]
*  Like the Biden campaign started early with outreach to Hispanic and black communities. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=40.0s)]
*  They need to keep up that outreach. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=44.04s)]
*  But I was reading the Tord de Forest profile of Joe Biden and the New Yorker this week [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=46.0s)]
*  by Evan Osnos. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=50.36s)]
*  And he talks to Sarah Longworth at the Bulwark, and she has a really smart point, which is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=51.36s)]
*  If Biden is not great at selling this, where are the surrogates? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=55.76s)]
*  Flood the zone. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  The right-wing is so adept at this, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Everything from talk radio to social media to the main networks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, everybody's saying the same thing over and over and over again, and the lies [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=67.64s)]
*  become truth. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=72.0s)]
*  Here, the truth needs to be accepted as the truth, and he needs so many ambassadors on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=73.0s)]
*  his side saying that thing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=78.36s)]
*  I keep thinking ... I think it's exactly correct because I think that you can't ... I mean, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=80.04s)]
*  the word media is because we are an intermediary, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=84.3s)]
*  Things happen here, and you're here, and what our job is to do literally is to be like, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=89.94s)]
*  yeah, yeah, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=95.02s)]
*  We're right in the middle. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=96.02s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=97.46s)]
*  We mediate, okay? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=98.46s)]
*  That has collapsed to a degree that I haven't ... I mean, not us, but generally out there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=99.74s)]
*  I just don't know where anyone's getting their information. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=105.46s)]
*  And I thought about that voter we had last night. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  We were talking about healthcare, and she had real concerns. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=109.94s)]
*  This is like a real voter that you can really talk to. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=113.18s)]
*  Healthcare, an IEP for a kid. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  And it's like how voters are connecting the dots. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  These are the things I care about, and these are the candidates. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  And even just the basic here's where they are on the issues, that to me is a big challenge, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=123.9s)]
*  too. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=128.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=129.86s)]
*  And I think you're right that the mediating role of there being a formal media in between [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=130.86s)]
*  things that happen in the world and how people find out about them, that sort of dissolving [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=135.46s)]
*  a little bit as we move to different forms and democratized forms of media is absolutely [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=139.6s)]
*  true. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=143.96s)]
*  But the other thing that is less comfortable to talk about is that what's replacing it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=144.96s)]
*  to a large degree is bad faith, bad actor disinformation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=150.52s)]
*  Not misinformation, not people getting stuff wrong by accident, but deliberate disinformation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=155.72s)]
*  And that space in Spanish language media, in English language media, in social media, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=161.52s)]
*  and in all the other ways that people access information online is absolutely toxic right [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=166.4s)]
*  now and deliberately so. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=171.12s)]
*  It is not people trying hard and failing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=172.68s)]
*  It is bad actors trying to destroy us as a country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=175.12s)]
*  And the fact that that information space is policed almost not at all or is policed by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  actors who actually want that, like Elon Musk, that is really that's a national security [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=185.82s)]
*  problem for the United States. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=191.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=192.72s)]
*  And it's a real democratic challenge. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=193.72s)]
*  It's a short-term challenge for anyone trying to get any message out about what's going [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=195.56s)]
*  on. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=198.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=199.96s)]
*  But it's also just a profound, it is the environment in which this campaign is going to take place. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=200.96s)]
*  And I have to say, having covered this and watched it, this is the worst I've seen that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=206.16s)]
*  information environment I would say since 2016, which is a bad year for that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=210.32s)]
*  And to your point about surrogates and also the other thing they're talking about, they're [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=215.7s)]
*  going to do a lot of paid media. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=219.6s)]
*  Now where that paid media is going to go and who it's going to reach and how well you can [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=220.96s)]
*  target, it's going to matter a lot, but there's going to be a lot of direct outreach to people [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=224.68s)]
*  that is going to matter a tremendous amount for precisely this reason. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=230.24s)]
*  They need to make an incredible volume of content. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=233.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=236.88s)]
*  They need to make a lot of content from a gazillion different sources going to a gazillion [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=237.88s)]
*  different places. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=241.84s)]
*  And I do not know if they are staffed for that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=242.84s)]
*  They also, I mean, I don't mean to indict the American public because I'm guilty of this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=244.24s)]
*  myself. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=248.6s)]
*  We've become very selfish in our media habits. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=249.6s)]
*  We want stuff that feels good, looks good, is funny, is entertaining. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=251.0s)]
*  And that reality is often at odds with, you know, politics and policy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=254.24s)]
*  And they have got to find a way to marry something that can go viral to a really important message [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=259.02s)]
*  that Biden needs to spread ahead of you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=264.2s)]
*  And it's much easier to make stuff go viral when the message is our country is a disaster. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=265.76s)]
*  It is being beset by a cabal of shadowy and all powerful enemies. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=270.8s)]
*  We need somebody to break the rules and to come in here and to take over with an iron [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=275.96s)]
*  fist and vanquish all of our countries. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, that's something that you can do virally very easily. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=283.0s)]
*  The message that we're taking care of your student loans and you're going to be able [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=287.2s)]
*  to hold on to your health insurance. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, we're bringing inflation down and the economic, the job market is good. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=292.84s)]
*  That's really hard to make sing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=297.64s)]
*  The Republicans give lots of fodder to the end of days thesis. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=299.68s)]
*  I mean, there's definitely a fire and brimstone message that Biden could could perpetuate [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  that would not be untruthful. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  There's also the fact that this touches on something Steve's talking about. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=310.04s)]
*  I mean, any time you see a president whose approval rating is, say, you know, in the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=313.44s)]
*  38, 39, 40, 41 and that, right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=318.36s)]
*  What it means is that that person is losing parts of their own coalition, their own voters. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. That's that's the so when you saw that 87 percent of again, all these numbers like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=326.6s)]
*  this is all guesswork. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=330.6s)]
*  Everyone's just take the sampling has gone to hell in the world of polling. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  People are doing their best. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=335.6s)]
*  But there's enough aggregate data over time to show certain things. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  And it seems to me that like those kind of swing voters are the swing voters who won [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  the first time are a key part, but also like finding out like who are the people that voted [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=345.56s)]
*  for you last time in that 13 percent and where are they now and why not is like the most [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=348.68s)]
*  low hanging fruit and the most. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=353.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I think the good thing is the information on voters, the data that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  we have, you know, with the right resources is pretty extraordinary. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=360.12s)]
*  They can find them if they want to find them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=363.92s)]
*  It's terrifying. It's very Orwellian, but they can find them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=366.24s)]
*  And I actually do have confidence in their ability to find whether they can convince [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=369.32s)]
*  them, whether they can bring them back into the work and whether they can bring them [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=372.56s)]
*  back home again, I think is an open question. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=375.52s)]
*  But I do think the states, the states are so enormously high that the recruitment of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  compelling characters and interlocutors for this movement that is really the movement [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=383.6s)]
*  against tyranny to save American democracy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  It shouldn't be that hard. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=390.8s)]
*  Popular funding to save American democracy and that urgency, I do think that, you know, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=392.24s)]
*  one of the people things that people have been pointing out is like people are not tuned [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  in yet and they are pretty checked out. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  And and Joe Biden has not been an omnipresent sort of person out there in the world and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=400.68s)]
*  certainly not in the way Donald Trump was, but not in the way Barack Obama was. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=407.6s)]
*  How do you see that? Like you are really focused on this question of the survival of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=411.36s)]
*  American democracy and stitching together a popular front that will defend it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=415.8s)]
*  Yeah. And it's happened before and it's what the project that you see happening now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=419.6s)]
*  Like how confident are you that that part of that is just a focus that like when people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=422.48s)]
*  lock in, they get it? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=427.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think that the idea that wins is that there is a supermajority in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=429.32s)]
*  America that is for democracy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=435.64s)]
*  I agree. And it is a nonpartisan supermajority of people who disagree with each other on [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=438.52s)]
*  a million different things. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=443.04s)]
*  But there is one thing that is a very clear choice in this election, and it is between [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=444.76s)]
*  having a democracy and not. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=449.36s)]
*  And if you can get people to accept that basic idea, which is a popular front idea, if [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=451.0s)]
*  you can get people to see that Chris Hayes and Liz Cheney are in the same room for some [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  reason, and that might mean something. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=460.56s)]
*  I mean, there's a million different dyads like that that you can draw. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=462.88s)]
*  I do think that you can get there over the next eight months. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=466.36s)]
*  This is an early time for the Republicans to be locking up their nominee. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=469.64s)]
*  But this is around the same time that John McCain locked it up in 2008 and John Kerry [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=473.8s)]
*  locked it up in 2004 and Al Gore locked it up in 2000. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=478.36s)]
*  And there is this feeling when you get an early lockup in the primary. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=481.56s)]
*  Wow, this campaign's got a head of steam. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=485.24s)]
*  They've got they're going to carry this all the way to the fall. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=487.68s)]
*  All three of those guys I just mentioned lost in the fall. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=490.0s)]
*  And and I think we should keep in mind what the timeline is. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=492.56s)]
*  There's a lot of time and and a country that fundamentally I agree with you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=495.44s)]
*  Like, I think a lot of work, a lot of wood to chop. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=499.6s)]
*  Yeah, Maddo and Alex Wagner. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=502.6s)]
*  What a this is just a delight. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=505.48s)]
*  Let's do this all the time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=507.04s)]
*  I would just you want to just go through nine. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=508.0s)]
*  I'll let you go get back to I news and that'll be. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=512.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rgk7YxJla4&t=515.84s)]
