# Infighting roils Trump transition team 'The fish rots from the head'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw)
*  If you're feeling extra stressed out or even fearful of what Trump and his crew have in store, that's understandable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=0.0s)]
*  But one thing to always keep in mind, this is not some relentlessly disciplined phalanx of soldiers, okay? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=5.5s)]
*  This is a constantly conniving and backbiting group of folks, always trying to look out for themselves and to cash in, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=14.0s)]
*  often turning on each other, and we're not, you know, we're not even close to inauguration day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=21.0s)]
*  We've already got examples. Here's the latest example. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=26.5s)]
*  According to the New York Times, Trump's legal team found evidence a top adviser asked for retainer fees from potential appointees [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=29.5s)]
*  in order to promote them for jobs in the new administration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=36.5s)]
*  The adviser is Boris Epstein. He's been close to Trump for years and was part of the alternate elector plot. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=39.5s)]
*  Actually, currently under indictment in Arizona for that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=46.0s)]
*  Recently, he's been helping Trump with his cabinet picks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=49.5s)]
*  According to the Times, Trump's legal team started looking into Epstein after several people told Trump that Epstein was asking for money [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=52.0s)]
*  from people who were looking for appointments. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=58.5s)]
*  Among those potential appointees, Scott Besant, he's Trump's chosen pick for Treasury Secretary. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=61.5s)]
*  According to the review, Mr. Epstein met with Mr. Besant in February, at a time when it was widely known that he was interested in the Treasury Post, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=67.5s)]
*  and proposed $30,000 to $40,000 a month to promote him around Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=75.0s)]
*  The Washington Post adds the report concluded that Epstein later asked Besant to invest $10 million in a three-on-three basketball league. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=81.5s)]
*  Why not? Sure. Boris Epstein's going to launch a three-on-three basketball league. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=89.5s)]
*  Yesterday, Epstein released a statement and said, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=93.5s)]
*  I am honored to work with President Trump and his team, because fake claims are false and defamatory, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=95.5s)]
*  and will not distract us from making America great again. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=100.5s)]
*  This kind of thing is what we come to expect from members of Trump's team. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=104.5s)]
*  It's baked in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=108.5s)]
*  As the Atlantic's Adam Searwer writes, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=110.5s)]
*  Adam Searwer, staff writer for the Atlantic, joins me now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=124.5s)]
*  I want to talk about your piece in a sec. First, on this, and again, I should be clear, Epstein says this is made up, that he did know such thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=127.5s)]
*  We know we have all sorts of examples of strange forms of influence peddling in the Trump circle through the many years that it's been there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=134.0s)]
*  There was accusations of people basically charging folks for pardon lobbying. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=142.0s)]
*  It does seem to me that we will be getting a lot of this, Adam, in this administration, if nothing else. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=148.0s)]
*  This is what happens when you surround yourself with these types of people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=156.5s)]
*  But I think, as they say, the fish rots from the head. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=164.5s)]
*  The New York Times did an article about all the different industries that Donald Trump had gone seeking financial support for during the election. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=168.5s)]
*  He went to the oil and gas industry and was like, you're going to do so well under me that you should give me a billion dollars. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=178.5s)]
*  This is one of the places in which the brand of Donald Trump outruns the reality of Donald Trump around his supporters. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=186.0s)]
*  They're all convinced he's so rich that he can't be bought when he's literally the most for sale president that has ever held the office. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=195.0s)]
*  When you consider the corruption of 19th century politics, that's actually pretty extraordinary. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=205.0s)]
*  Yes, one of the things in corruption of 19th century politics is you had politicians having rich donors buy them houses and buy them horse carriages and paying for everything for them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=210.5s)]
*  They were just completely in hoc as a matter of decades of the worst forms of Gilded Age corruption. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=220.5s)]
*  It seems like we're headed towards something that surpasses that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=228.5s)]
*  I think Donald Trump is a 19th century American politician in a lot more ways than one. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=233.0s)]
*  We don't have to go into all the details here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=240.0s)]
*  He's someone who has more or less explicitly said that he will do favors for industries that support him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=243.0s)]
*  I think when you look at how he's going to run his government, you can expect that that's how he will use the powers of the presidency. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=251.0s)]
*  That's precisely the problem with elevating someone like Donald Trump to an office that has such tremendous power. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=259.5s)]
*  One of the themes I've been returning to a fair amount in the last few weeks since the election is a theme that was identified in 2004 particularly about the sort of ways that Republican politics, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=265.5s)]
*  particularly the Bush campaign, had promised people one set of things they were voting for and then delivered something else and they got in the office. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=278.5s)]
*  The biggest example is we're going to be tough on the war on terror and we're your representatives in this sort of cultural war against the elitist liberals and then we're going to privatize Social Security. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=286.0s)]
*  Your piece is interesting because you're sort of identifying a parallel but similar tension in Trump's victory between how people that gave him the victory understand what they were voting for and what Trump seems intent on delivering. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=296.0s)]
*  Explain. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=313.0s)]
*  Well, I think one other thing that the Republican, the conservative media propaganda apparatus was very effective at doing was crowding out sort of these stories about Trump that might indicate his intentions being something other than fighting for the common man. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=314.5s)]
*  So people sort of kept this, like I said, the brand identity of Donald Trump outran the reality of Donald Trump among the people who ultimately supported him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=328.5s)]
*  They saw him a moderate on certain issues, particularly abortion, where he is not one. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=337.5s)]
*  And so I think there's this perception that he's going to come in and he's going to fix the economy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=343.0s)]
*  And, you know, all these things, all these warnings about authoritarianism, you know, that stuff can be taken less seriously because he didn't actually succeed at that last time around. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=348.0s)]
*  Somebody will stop him. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=358.0s)]
*  And this is a place where I think the Democrats have sort of been a victim of their own success because they were successful in constraining Donald Trump the first time with very little help from the Republican Party. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=359.0s)]
*  People assume that those guardrails are going to hold again, and I don't think they necessarily will. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=371.5s)]
*  You're right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=376.5s)]
*  Many people who voted for him believe he will only do only the things they think are good, such as improve the economy, and none of the things they think are bad, such as acts as a dictator. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=377.5s)]
*  Or if he does those bad things, the burden will be borne by other people, not them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=384.5s)]
*  This is the problem with the political movement rooted in deception denial. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=388.5s)]
*  Your own supporters may not like it when you end up doing the things you actually do. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=391.5s)]
*  And I think to me, this sort of Trump question, and again, I don't think it makes any sense to be like, haha, like you're getting you're getting your just desserts. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=396.0s)]
*  Like, I think I would rather not see the country like harmed and hurt. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=403.0s)]
*  First of all, but on the terror thing, it's like he really did say this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=408.0s)]
*  And there really was this, you know, across the board sense like he's not serious, even in sophisticated Wall Street types, sophisticated lobbyists. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=413.0s)]
*  And maybe they know better than I am. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=422.5s)]
*  Maybe he isn't. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=423.5s)]
*  And maybe he won't do it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=424.5s)]
*  But it does seem like that was a weird bet to place. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=425.5s)]
*  I think for all this, all the unique qualities of Donald Trump as an individual, fundamentally, what we are being offered here is the traditional Republican deal of culture, war, nonsense, red meat for you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=428.5s)]
*  And then giveaways to the richest people in the country. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=443.5s)]
*  And I think the question is, you know, if he actually doesn't post terrorists yet, if he actually does proceed with plans that do in fact wreck the economy, I think that is going to break the spell for some people. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=449.0s)]
*  But, you know, if he doesn't, you know, there's a lot of things that bad things that he could get away with. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=465.0s)]
*  Also, the American economy is quite resilient. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=466.0s)]
*  And there's a lot you can sort of do at the edges without, you know, tanking it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=468.0s)]
*  Collapsing everything. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=472.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's going to be a lot. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=473.0s)]
*  There's a lot that can be done in terms of drama that is different than, you know, everything crashes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=474.5s)]
*  Adam Serwer, as always, pleasure. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=481.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=482.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzABqioiaVw&t=504.0s)]
