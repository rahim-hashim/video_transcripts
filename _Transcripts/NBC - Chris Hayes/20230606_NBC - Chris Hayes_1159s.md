# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 5
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY)
*  So, last week, the bipartisan deal to avoid defaulting on our national debt passed with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=0.0s)]
*  overwhelming majorities in Congress over the objections of mainly a group of far-right [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=5.2s)]
*  Republicans. One of those outspoken critics was Congresswoman Lauren Boebert of Colorado, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  no surprise, who repeatedly promised to vote against the bill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  The bill Biden negotiated fuels inflation, adds trillions to our debt, and leaves a blank [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=21.0s)]
*  check for more of the same nonsense I came here to stop. I am not for an unlimited debt [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=26.54s)]
*  ceiling increase. As presented today, I'm voting no. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=32.9s)]
*  You heard her. She's pretty in sense there. I'm voting no. So it seemed a bit strange [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=38.9s)]
*  when Lauren Boebert just didn't show up at all to vote on Wednesday. Over the weekend, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=43.94s)]
*  the congressman posted a video claiming she'd skipped the vote in protest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=48.18s)]
*  Hey everyone, I am back in Colorado, but let's talk about DC. No excuses. I was ticked off. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=53.3s)]
*  They wouldn't let me do my job, so I didn't take the vote. Once again, Washington's power [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=59.5s)]
*  machine shoved a multi-trillion dollar bill down our throats, refused to allow debate or [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  amendments, disregarded everything we fought for in January to actually allow representatives [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=69.34s)]
*  to do their jobs, and instead, they served us up a crap sandwich. Call it a no-show protest, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=75.46s)]
*  but I certainly let every one of my colleagues and the country know I was against this garbage of a bill. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=83.02s)]
*  A no-show protest to a crap sandwich. It's quite a phrase, according to the congresswoman. But as [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=89.05999999999999s)]
*  it turns out, that doesn't seem to be actually what happened. A Capitol Hill producer caught [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=96.3s)]
*  Lauren Boebert on tape frantically running into the building Wednesday evening too late to vote. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=100.62s)]
*  I can't stop watching that. And Boebert actually admitted that she was late and missed the vote [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=106.26s)]
*  on the congressional record, saying that she was unavoidably detained, and if she, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=122.62s)]
*  quote, had been present, she would have voted nay. So it's sort of like saying, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=128.9s)]
*  if I hadn't slept through my alarm, I swear I would have aced that test. It's almost as if [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=133.66s)]
*  she didn't think anyone would check. No one was tracking. I guess it's not a huge surprise, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=138.94s)]
*  given Lauren Boebert has a pretty loose relationship with facts. And I can tell you, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=142.7s)]
*  she wouldn't be the first on President Biden's call sheet of Republicans. But there are lots [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=147.26s)]
*  of Republicans that this president can find common cause with, showing his willingness to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  extend olive branches across the aisle is basically part of what got him elected in 2020. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=156.22s)]
*  It was part of his strategy and a big part of the strategy going into 2024. Much more of that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=160.66s)]
*  coming up next. And in my time working for the president as his White House press secretary, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=165.54s)]
*  I saw firsthand just how he thinks about his role and how he thinks about Republicans. And [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  as he looks ahead to 2024, he is reaching back to the success of his 2020 bid and the messaging [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=177.33999999999997s)]
*  around that, campaigning against Trumpism without totally alienating all Republicans. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=183.62s)]
*  The idea in part is for the president to convince people who may not be Democrats to come over and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=189.38s)]
*  support him too, if they can't stomach Trump. And it's not just politics. That's also who he is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=195.22s)]
*  When I worked for him, he would regularly pick up the phone and call Republicans without much [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=200.58s)]
*  fanfare, without announcing it. He's kind of a bridge builder by nature. The open question is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=205.34s)]
*  that strategy will pay off in 2024. My next guests are people who I've spent a lot of time [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=211.38s)]
*  with in their offices, on the phone, texting them about strategies. So I'm so grateful for them for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=217.1s)]
*  being here tonight. Kate Bedingfield is the former White House communications director under [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=222.86s)]
*  president Biden. We worked very closely together. Robert Gibbs served as the White House press [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=226.46s)]
*  secretary for president Obama also worked very closely with him. I want to start just with this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=230.66s)]
*  overarching question, Kate, for you, because you worked for the president for so long. You know him [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  very well. I think his overarching view is that there's a real appetite out there in the country [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=239.94s)]
*  for someone who can find common ground, even with members of the modern day Republican Party. That [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=244.26s)]
*  promise was, of course, a big pitch in 2020. How central, Kate, do you think that is going to be to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=248.74s)]
*  the reelection campaign and the messaging of that as we look to 2024? Well, first of all, thanks for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  having me, Jen. This is a treat. But yes, I think that's going to be a critical piece of the messaging [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=261.54s)]
*  in 2024 because for two reasons. One, because as you said, it is fundamentally what President Biden [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=266.18s)]
*  believes. It is how he has long navigated Washington, frankly, successfully. And he [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=271.70000000000005s)]
*  fundamentally believes that leaders should be able to find common cause when they can. And I think [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=277.14000000000004s)]
*  secondly, it will be a huge piece of the messaging because we should do away with this notion that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  it's an either or dichotomy, that you either have to fire up the base or you can reach out across the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=286.74s)]
*  aisle. Remember, Democratic voters are people who also want to see progress. They want to see things [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=292.82s)]
*  get done. And so what President Biden's been able to do in the first few years of his presidency [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=297.78s)]
*  is notch wins where Republicans wouldn't come along, things that he couldn't get them to do. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=302.74s)]
*  He went and did them himself. The Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest investment in tackling [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=308.1s)]
*  climate change in a generation. He did that without Republican votes, but he was able to get [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=312.42s)]
*  Republican votes for a gun safety bill, able to get meaningful things done with Republicans. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=316.9s)]
*  And for him, that's fundamental. And I think that is what voters want to see. And you can bet that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=321.62s)]
*  that will be a central piece of his pitch for 2024. So, you know, obviously it's going to be a part [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  of his pitch. Kate, just confirm that for us gives you've done a lot of campaigns. You didn't work on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=330.98s)]
*  the Biden campaign, but in this age of Trump, do you think that message in this environment is going [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=335.38s)]
*  to work if it's central to the president's reelection campaign? I think it will only work. I think it's [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  what the American people yearn for. And I don't think it's a glowy, romanticized version of it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=348.58s)]
*  They just know that in an argument where two people are having that argument, that the likely [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=354.58s)]
*  answer lies somewhere in the middle. And I totally agree with Kate. I think people come to Washington [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=360.82s)]
*  to get things done, whether you're the most junior member of Congress or the most senior member of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=366.34s)]
*  the Senate or the president of the United States, you want to see progress on things. And the American [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=372.58s)]
*  people are sophisticated enough to know that the only way they're going to see progress is if both [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=377.7s)]
*  sides work together. And they spent four years watching somebody foment division, sometimes and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=382.58s)]
*  almost always unnecessarily. Biden pitched himself as the competent grownup in the room that would [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=390.34s)]
*  wipe away the chaos and could bring Washington together. I love the line he's been using, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  and I'm sure it's been using it for a while that he's, you know, I was told this bipartisanship was [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=401.94s)]
*  dead. I think that is a great way to pitch it. I think his accomplishments show it. And I have no [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=406.74s)]
*  doubt we're going to hear a lot about it over the course of the next two years. So one of the big [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=412.98s)]
*  elephants in the room here, see what I did there, is all of these legal woes and troubles for Trump. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, he's already been indicted. He could be indicted in a federal court soon. The president [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  has not spoken about it. He is an observer of the tradition that you should not comment on an [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=429.14s)]
*  ongoing investigation. Do you think, Kate, that continues to be the strategy moving forward as [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=433.94s)]
*  these cases become not about hush money to an adult film star, but about democracy and about [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=439.86s)]
*  national security and rule of law? Well, I think President Biden has never hesitated to call [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=447.3s)]
*  Donald Trump out for the threat that he believes that he poses to democracy. So, you know, I would [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=454.9s)]
*  say that there's no question that President Biden is going to always never going to shy away from [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=460.02s)]
*  calling out what he sees as a really frankly an existential threat to our country. However, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=464.74s)]
*  he's also going to continue to focus on what he's gotten done on the case that he has made for [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=470.02s)]
*  bringing back manufacturing jobs, for, you know, bringing semiconductor chips back to this country, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=476.18s)]
*  making sure we're having our supply chains here in the United States. We're not dependent on [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  countries overseas. He's doing things that are making a difference for the economy. He's doing [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=484.74s)]
*  things that are tackling, as I said earlier, our climate crisis, the gun crisis. He's fighting to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=489.22s)]
*  protect our rights. He's fighting to protect the right of women to have access to abortion, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=493.86s)]
*  to reproductive health. So I think what you're going to see, I would imagine what you will see [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  from the president is you will continue to see him make the case for the things he's done, the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=503.06s)]
*  promises he's kept, frankly, from the 2020 campaign. And but you will also see him never shy away from [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=507.06s)]
*  calling out the threat that he believes that Trump and MAGAism pose to this country. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=513.94s)]
*  I ask this because I think it's a really tricky balance, right? And most Democratic candidates, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=519.7s)]
*  most candidates don't have to run against Trump. So Gibbs, what do you think about whether the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=524.34s)]
*  president should weigh in more on the broad messaging of these cases or these cases in general? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think the tack he's taken so far, I think is the right one. Look, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=536.0200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump guarantees every day that the news about Donald Trump is going to get [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=541.06s)]
*  hefty placement in our news diet. There's not really anything that the president needs to do to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=545.78s)]
*  push that case forward. I think it's also going to be interesting to watch when or if the Republicans [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=551.2199999999999s)]
*  running against Trump begin to try to shout out a difference between him and an indictment, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=558.5s)]
*  whether it's in New York, or whether it could be coming indictments. I think the president is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=565.94s)]
*  best suited, as Kate described, to make the case that really works so well in 2022, which is, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=571.1400000000001s)]
*  are you in the mainstream or are you in the extreme? And I think what Donald Trump, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=577.86s)]
*  what Republicans are, whether it's on guns, whether it's on abortion, whether it's on [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=582.58s)]
*  healthcare costs, I think they're a party that seems to be a step outside of the mainstream, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=589.94s)]
*  particularly when it comes to swing voters. That's the contrast I think he draws the most [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=595.7s)]
*  blood from. I think it's the one he's best suited, given his political leanings for the course of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=601.38s)]
*  his career. I think those are the contrasts that you'll see him make the most. So Kate, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=608.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm a believer that the president is often underestimated. I know you are too from talking [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=613.7800000000001s)]
*  to you about it. There is one thing a lot of people are freaking out about in the Democratic [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=618.66s)]
*  Party, and that is enthusiasm among young people, among progressives. What is your take, or what [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=623.4599999999999s)]
*  would you tell them so that they don't freak out about where this is headed and how the president [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=631.3s)]
*  is going to work to win those votes? Well, first of all, it feels like sometimes there's a cottage [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=636.3399999999999s)]
*  industry in professional Democratic circles of, one, both underestimating Joe Biden, but also [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=643.22s)]
*  wringing your hands and panicking and frantic. We spent as much energy tackling the problems as we [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=649.22s)]
*  did telling reporters we were worried. The narratives might be very different. But look, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=654.98s)]
*  I think ultimately what the president is going to do is going to continue to focus on the case he's [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=659.86s)]
*  made. And I think it's important to remember elections don't happen in a vacuum. Elections [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=665.62s)]
*  are about choice and about contrast. And the president frequently says, don't compare me to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=670.82s)]
*  the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative. And so as the campaign goes on and you continue to see [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=675.7s)]
*  this contrast between the extremism of Trump and the MAGA Republicans and this progress that Joe [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=681.1400000000001s)]
*  Biden's offering, I think people will, at the end of the day, they're going to pull that lever for [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=686.4200000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden. Kate Beddingfield and Robert Gibbs, two of the smartest people I know in Democratic politics [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=690.5s)]
*  and communications, thank you so much for joining me tonight. Steve, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=695.86s)]
*  the Republican primary field for 2024 is getting more crowded by the day. You may have noticed that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=701.5400000000001s)]
*  with Chris Christie, Mike Pence and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum all expected to enter the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  race this week. But today, one other Republican who was considered a possible candidate announced [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=712.1800000000001s)]
*  that he's not running. New Hampshire Governor Kristen Nunu, a moderate self-described pro-choice [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=718.0200000000001s)]
*  Republican who handily won reelection to a fourth term last year, writes in a Washington Post op-ed [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=723.22s)]
*  that quote, our party is on a collision course toward electoral irrelevance without significant [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=728.82s)]
*  corrective action. And that quote, the stakes are too high for a crowded field to hand the nomination [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  to a candidate who earns just 35% of the vote. And I will help ensure this does not happen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=742.1800000000001s)]
*  Strong words there. We all know which Republican primary candidate he means. I think we know. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=747.38s)]
*  And Governor Sununu joins me now. So let's start with an announcement that we're going, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  you had a big news day today, but let's start with an announcement that we're going to see in [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=757.78s)]
*  New Hampshire tomorrow. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is going to make his run official [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=760.74s)]
*  in your home state. Neither of you hold back in criticizing Donald Trump. Do you have that in [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=766.02s)]
*  common? Do you think he has a path to beat Donald Trump in the primary? Oh, sure. Look, I think [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=770.8199999999999s)]
*  almost all the candidates have a very viable path to beating Donald Trump. And you know, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=777.54s)]
*  you just said it right there. Chris isn't shy about casting criticism where it is well deserved with [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=781.38s)]
*  the former president. But this is the problem. All 12 of the other candidates need to cast the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=786.9s)]
*  same type of criticism because it's done. It's not that we're there out there to beat Donald Trump. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=792.26s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't represent the Republican Party, right? He's the outsider. And we've kind [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=798.42s)]
*  of let him get away with kind of co-opting. I think what are better traditional ideals of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=802.26s)]
*  the Republican Party of limited government and local control. He wants to relitigate the past. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=807.86s)]
*  And if we're going to be successful in the Republican Party, we've got to move forward in [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=812.18s)]
*  the future. So I think Chris is a very good candidate. I think they're all really good [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=815.3s)]
*  candidates. They're all my friends. I think there's a lot to play out. We haven't even had a debate [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=818.18s)]
*  yet. So we're going to see who can take a punch, who can give a punch, who can really stand on that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=821.78s)]
*  stage and make the case of America's future, not just worrying about litigating the past. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=826.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, we know Governor Christie can give a punch. We don't know what his path is yet. We'll see. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=830.9s)]
*  But I do want to give you an opportunity to make a little news. So are you going to endorse [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=836.3399999999999s)]
*  Governor Christie tomorrow when he's in your home state? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=839.7s)]
*  Look, I love Chris. He's one of my better friends, really. But no, I may endorse somebody at some [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=843.94s)]
*  point, but that'll be down the road. They got to earn it, right? They got to be in the living [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=848.5s)]
*  rooms of New Hampshire. They got to go to the 99 counties in Iowa. They got to go to the fairs. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=852.26s)]
*  They got to do the retail politics because that proves a sense of good retail management. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=856.02s)]
*  And that's exactly what this country is looking for. Good retail managers that don't just talk [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=861.0600000000001s)]
*  about their issues, but that can listen and talk to the issues that are actually resonating with [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=865.78s)]
*  the constituents. And that's the real difference. It's not about money or headlines or any of that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=870.5s)]
*  It's about really connecting with people. So as you're watching this, you said very clearly [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=875.54s)]
*  that if a candidate isn't breaking through, they need to drop out by Christmas. I've been in politics [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=879.4599999999999s)]
*  a while. Candidates don't usually like to be told when to drop out. But are you going to be calling [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=884.42s)]
*  out specific candidates in public when you think it's time for them to go? If not publicly, are [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=888.5s)]
*  you going to be having these conversations privately? What can we expect? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=892.82s)]
*  No, look, it's not just me. I think there'll be a lot of voices calling out candidates. They [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=898.1800000000001s)]
*  got plenty of time, though. We have all fall to prove themselves, and anyone who wants to get in [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=902.2600000000001s)]
*  can get in. But it's not just the Chris Sununas of the world. It's, I think, going to be a lot of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=906.4200000000001s)]
*  voices. They're going to be telling folks, hey, you gave it a shot. It's not there. The donor base, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=910.58s)]
*  the donor base that has given money to these candidates have to be actually the first ones [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=914.74s)]
*  to say, I know I gave you a lot of money. It's not happening. Pull out. Let's narrow this field [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=918.34s)]
*  down. So it really has to be a resonating message so we don't have a repeat of 16. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=922.6600000000001s)]
*  It looks like, according to a lot of legal eagles, we could see another indictment for Donald Trump [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=927.38s)]
*  soon. Now, we know the hush money indictment didn't seem to change the dynamic. If anything, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=932.4200000000001s)]
*  it seemed to help him in the polls. Do you think any indictment, an indictment on issues around [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=936.1800000000001s)]
*  other indictments could help other candidates or would hurt Trump? No. You don't think the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=942.26s)]
*  indictments matter? No. No. I don't want to put words in your mouth. Obviously they don't. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=945.7800000000001s)]
*  No, they absolutely don't matter. No, these indictments, and if I may, a combination of the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=949.7800000000001s)]
*  media, you're creating the boy who cried wolf syndrome, right? What happened in New York was [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=955.1400000000001s)]
*  wrong. I mean, it really was. They are beating up on Trump for political reasons. Everybody sees [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=961.46s)]
*  that. What happened with the Russian collusion that never existed effectively exonerated the guy [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=966.2600000000001s)]
*  so he can play a victim card. You've all created a situation where God, what kind of planet are we [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=971.3000000000001s)]
*  on where Donald Trump's become the victim? Well, that's really what it is. I think we very, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=976.42s)]
*  so now nobody believes it. Nobody believes it. We know I have to stop you on there because we know [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=980.0999999999999s)]
*  very clearly that Putin and the Kremlin did intervene in our election in order to try to [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=983.86s)]
*  help Donald Trump back in 2016. So we know that it's true, but you may think that they shouldn't [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=988.66s)]
*  engage in this as a messaging tool because it's not helpful to them. Is that what you're saying? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=993.62s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to re-litigate, you know, the Russian collusion nonsense that went on for two [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=999.06s)]
*  years where everyone said that it was real. You don't need to re-litigate. It's been litigated [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1004.02s)]
*  by lawyers and investigations. Yeah, yeah, it's nonsense. But now nobody buys that any attack on [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1006.5799999999999s)]
*  Trump isn't anything but political. Everyone has kind of created this scenario and he is playing it [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1015.22s)]
*  to the fullest. He's playing the violin strings better than anyone imagined, which is why his [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1020.5s)]
*  poll numbers miraculously are actually going up. So these candidates are going to have to get on [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1024.58s)]
*  the stage, talk about what they're going to do going forward. Every one of them has to call him [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1028.98s)]
*  out. If you're not calling out Donald Trump for the non-Republican that he really is, for the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1032.74s)]
*  mistakes he made in the past, then you don't deserve to be on the stage. We're not here to run for [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1037.78s)]
*  vice president. We're not here to sell books. If you want to be president, then you better stand up [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1042.26s)]
*  and give it everything you got. And those candidates that don't do that aren't going to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1045.94s)]
*  go very far. They're going to be driven out of the race. And we're going to get down to one or two [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1049.22s)]
*  candidates because one on one, Trump and somebody else, he loses. He loses the nomination. And then [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1052.42s)]
*  the Republicans actually have a shot to win in 24. I think almost anybody would beat Joe Biden [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1057.94s)]
*  right now in 24, except Donald Trump. So I want to ask you about abortion. We've talked about this [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1062.98s)]
*  a little bit before. The range of candidates in the field have a lot of different positions. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1068.6599999999999s)]
*  You're a pro-choice governor. What do you think the position of the party should be? And how should [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1073.22s)]
*  these candidates be talking about it on the trail? Look, I think it's really simple. Dobbs now says [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1078.74s)]
*  that the states can make their decisions and they will. And everyone has to understand that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1085.46s)]
*  California and Mississippi are going to have very different paths on abortion. And that's now up to [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1089.22s)]
*  the voters to decide whether they want their, those legislators and those governors to make those [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1093.54s)]
*  decisions. And so there's more voter connection there. That's the new reality. So anything that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1097.6200000000001s)]
*  the Republicans are talking about in terms of national abortion bans and all that, it becomes [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1102.5s)]
*  a very scary message that can't be explained. And you drive independence and young voters away. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1106.42s)]
*  And that's exactly the opposite of what we should be doing. We got to bring them back onto the team. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1111.22s)]
*  We got to make them feel empowered, get them excited about something, not confuse them with [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1114.5s)]
*  national abortion ban message. It just, it isn't what carries the day. We need to talk about [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1118.66s)]
*  inflation and energy independence and healthcare reform, border security. These are the things that [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1122.5s)]
*  really matter at a national level and can be fixed. And if we're talking about abortion, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1128.02s)]
*  we're getting distracted and probably losing voters in the process. New Hampshire governor, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1132.26s)]
*  Kristen Nunu. Thank you so much for joining me this evening at a big day. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogNyAZNikY&t=1136.02s)]
