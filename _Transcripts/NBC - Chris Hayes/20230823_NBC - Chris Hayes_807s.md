# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 22
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis)
*  One of the key things to understand as we head into the first debate tomorrow is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=0.0s)]
*  the Republican primary or Republican presidential politics is not actually entirely about Donald [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=9.92s)]
*  It is as much about President Joe Biden and the way that the hermetically sealed conservative [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=11.24s)]
*  universe understands and depicts Joe Biden. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=16.96s)]
*  In their minds, the president is both a venal and preposterous figure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=20.22s)]
*  He's the corrupt head of the so-called Biden crime family who has been unbeknownst to anyone [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=24.92s)]
*  apparently taking illegal bribes for years, just not caught. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=29.98s)]
*  Of course, there's no evidence that's true. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=33.02s)]
*  But according to conservatives, the president is also a national laughing stock. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=36.22s)]
*  He's a feeble old man being propped up by aides who everyone thinks is incompetent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=39.34s)]
*  Well, I think they're all alarmed at the president's condition. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  He's obviously senile. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=49.82s)]
*  He's faltering. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=51.74s)]
*  It's not going to get better between now and election day and beyond. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=52.74s)]
*  Wouldn't the energy levels on that stage between the former president and the current president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=57.54s)]
*  be pretty shocking for viewers? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=62.86s)]
*  Well, they might be, Mike. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=64.94s)]
*  Oh, the former president is like a year and a half younger. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=67.82s)]
*  That one, the 78 year old. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=70.78s)]
*  This perception of Joe Biden, feeble and venal and ridiculous all at the same time, is so [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=73.22s)]
*  ingrained, so taken for granted in conservative media. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=79.3s)]
*  There's just no room for any other understanding of the man or his political appeal or the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=83.78s)]
*  tens of millions of people who voted for him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=89.18s)]
*  We have such a great new example of that in a video posted by the Republican National [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=91.86s)]
*  Committee's opposition research team. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=96.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=99.02s)]
*  They're supposed to find like the gotcha quotes, like, oh, look at this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  This is a moment for President Biden's trip to the devastated island of Maui. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=103.62s)]
*  And to be clear, the RNC thinks this clip makes Joe Biden look bad. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=106.9s)]
*  What's the boss's name? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=113.78s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=115.78s)]
*  That's how you do a battle. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=117.78s)]
*  You've got a good shot, too. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=125.78s)]
*  You guys catch the boots out here? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=129.78s)]
*  That's a hard job, man. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=133.78s)]
*  Now, I think most people watch that and think, that's a nice moment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=135.78s)]
*  He obviously likes dogs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=141.78s)]
*  He's concerned about the dog's welfare. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=142.78s)]
*  It's hot there in the fire area. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=143.78s)]
*  And I think most Americans like dogs, too. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=147.78s)]
*  But Republicans posted this like, get a load of this loser. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=149.78s)]
*  They have zero idea, truly zero, like, intuitive, subjective sense of how anyone could like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=155.78s)]
*  the guy, how anyone could vote for him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=162.78s)]
*  And you can see their complete and utter confidence in this recent polling from NBC News and the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=165.78s)]
*  Des Moines Register. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=170.78s)]
*  65% of likely Iowa Republican caucus goers say that a president who comes closest to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=171.78s)]
*  them on the issues is most important to them, versus 29% who say they are most concerned [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=176.78s)]
*  with picking a candidate who has the best chance of beating President Biden. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=181.78s)]
*  And the reason for that is they're not prioritizing electability, and this shows up in all [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=184.78s)]
*  polling, because they're not worried about it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=188.78s)]
*  They are not worried they're going to lose to Joe Biden. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=191.78s)]
*  They think anyone can beat Joe Biden. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=193.78s)]
*  Now, you could say that this is not just, you know, conservatives. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=196.78s)]
*  You can say the same was true of liberals who couldn't understand how anyone would vote [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=203.78s)]
*  for Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=207.78s)]
*  But of course, Trump managed to win the election quite infamously, despite losing the pot [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=209.78s)]
*  per vote by several million votes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=213.78s)]
*  And that shock precipitated four straight years of reckoning as countless journalists [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=215.78s)]
*  from mainstream to progressive, center, center-left, establishment, anti-establishment, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=220.78s)]
*  all did the same reporting, asked how they missed Donald Trump's appeal. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=225.78s)]
*  They talked to Trump voters over and over and over again, kind of a punchline, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=229.78s)]
*  The Trump supporter in the diner who says they still like Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=234.78s)]
*  How much the media wrestled with this, how much they obsessed over it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=237.78s)]
*  But it did at least represent a needed correction to the overconfidence a lot of people on the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=241.78s)]
*  left and center-left had before that election. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=245.78s)]
*  That reckoning has never happened on the right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=248.78s)]
*  You would think that that reckoning would have come when their beloved God King, Donald [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=253.78s)]
*  Trump, lost to the guy they think is a ridiculous, senile joke, Joe Biden, in 2020. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=258.78s)]
*  And that election was not close. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=265.78s)]
*  Donald Trump lost by five points almost, four and a half, seven million votes and four and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=268.78s)]
*  a half points. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=274.78s)]
*  He lost by a wider margin than a whole bunch of other loser Republicans from Herschel Walker [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=275.78s)]
*  to David Ferdinand to Kelly Loeffler and Martha McSally. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=280.78s)]
*  You never hear about those people, do you? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=285.78s)]
*  Anymore. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=286.78s)]
*  You know why? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=287.78s)]
*  Because they were losers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=288.78s)]
*  They lost. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=290.78s)]
*  So no one cares what they think about politics. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=291.78s)]
*  Donald Trump got his butt kicked way harder than they did. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=294.78s)]
*  This is why Donald Trump's big lie is so important, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=300.78s)]
*  Along with the cult of personality still surrounding him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=304.78s)]
*  It's key to understanding this weird phenomenon, the Republican Party, the politics at this [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=307.78s)]
*  moment. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=313.78s)]
*  The vehemence with which conservatives still insist the 2020 election was rigged, it protects [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=314.78s)]
*  them from this reckoning. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=319.78s)]
*  There's no way the American people actually chose Joe Biden as their president. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=321.78s)]
*  He never left his basement. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=325.78s)]
*  It's a kind of psychological defense mechanism. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=326.78s)]
*  They don't want to accept that the man they are so devoted to is a loser. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=329.78s)]
*  And deeper down, I think it's also an expression of the belief that people who voted for Joe [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=334.78s)]
*  Biden aren't really the real Americans. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=338.78s)]
*  They don't really count. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=340.78s)]
*  The MAGA folks are the ones who should be running this country, even if they're outnumbered. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=342.78s)]
*  The big lie and the cult of personality surrounding Trump keeps the ruse going, that he won and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=346.78s)]
*  that Joe Biden is a loser when it's the other way around. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=350.78s)]
*  That way, conservatives don't have to deal with the reality that Republican politics [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=354.78s)]
*  are minority politics. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=357.78s)]
*  When the nation en masse comes out to vote, they're on the losing side over and over [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=359.78s)]
*  and over again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=364.78s)]
*  The only way to pierce Donald Trump's hole in the party is to convince some significant [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=365.78s)]
*  portion of the Republican primary electorate of the basic fact that the man is a loser. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=369.78s)]
*  He is a bigger loser than many of his fellow Republicans in 2020. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=375.78s)]
*  He's an even bigger loser than Mitt Romney was in 2012. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=378.78s)]
*  If there's a first step to breaking Trump's grip on the party, it's hammering the simple [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=383.78s)]
*  truth. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=387.78s)]
*  People in the Southern California community of Cedar Glen are mourning a beloved neighbor [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=390.78s)]
*  and clothing store owner who displayed a rainbow pride flag named Laura Ann Carlton. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=394.78s)]
*  Laura Ann was a mother of nine in her blended family, and on Friday, she was shot and killed [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=400.78s)]
*  at her store after a dispute over the pride flag she hung outside her store called Magpie, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=405.78s)]
*  according to the sheriff of San Bernardino County. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=411.78s)]
*  Investigators determined prior to the shooting that Ikeguchi tore down a pride or rainbow [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=415.78s)]
*  flag that was hanging in front of the Magpie store and yelled many homophobic slurs toward [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=419.78s)]
*  Carlton. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=425.78s)]
*  Carlton, who worked at Magpie, confronted Ikeguchi, and during the confirmation, Ikeguchi [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=426.78s)]
*  shot and killed Carlton. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=431.78s)]
*  NBC's Maggie Vespa spoke to a friend and neighboring store owner about that moment. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=434.78s)]
*  Basically, I screamed, Lori's been shot. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=439.78s)]
*  Close your door. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=443.78s)]
*  He might still be out there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=444.78s)]
*  And I said, oh my gosh, is she okay? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=446.78s)]
*  And she said, no, I think they're saying she's been killed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=449.78s)]
*  And hearing the words is something very shocking. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=456.78s)]
*  It is shocking. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=460.78s)]
*  This is the latest in what has been a string of violent attacks on LGBTQ folks, people [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=461.78s)]
*  expressing support for them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=466.78s)]
*  Just over three weeks ago, a 28-year-old gay dancer in New York City was just out with [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=468.78s)]
*  his friends when he was stabbed to death at a service station. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=472.78s)]
*  A group of men confronted the group at the station, reportedly hurling homophobic slurs [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=476.78s)]
*  and telling them to stop dancing. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=481.78s)]
*  The suspect in the killing is 17 years old. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=483.78s)]
*  A recent report tallied over 350 incidents of harassment, vandalism, and assault against [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=487.78s)]
*  LGBTQ folks from June 2022 through April 23. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=492.78s)]
*  Noah Goldberg is a staff fighter for the Los Angeles Times who spent time in the community [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=497.78s)]
*  Cedar Glen to report on the shooting. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=501.78s)]
*  And Noah, thanks for joining us. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=503.78s)]
*  First, just tell me a little bit about Laura Ann and the shop and how she was known in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=505.78s)]
*  that community. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=510.78s)]
*  Laura Ann Carlton was a shop owner and advocate. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=512.78s)]
*  She was known for being equally entrepreneur and advocate for the LGBTQ community. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=517.78s)]
*  She owned this shop in Cedar Glen, which is right by Lake Arrowhead. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=522.78s)]
*  She also had a shop with the same name in Studio City called Magpie. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=527.78s)]
*  And according to everyone who knew her in the area, she was just a lovely person who [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=531.78s)]
*  really cared, and she hung this pride flag up outside her shop. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=535.78s)]
*  And even though people sometimes gave her trouble about it, I know there was a story [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=539.78s)]
*  a neighboring shop owner told me about some guy in a pickup truck who asked her to take [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=544.78s)]
*  it down and said, why don't you have an American flag up, which she actually did. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=549.78s)]
*  But she just said, you don't have to shop at my store and you can keep going, but I'm [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=553.78s)]
*  going to keep it up. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=556.78s)]
*  That's my store. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=557.78s)]
*  Tell us about what we know about the incident itself and how it transpired. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=560.78s)]
*  Yeah, so I spoke to someone today who saw CCTV footage of the shooting. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=565.78s)]
*  Basically, you can see the suspect, Travis Ikeguchi, seemingly yelling. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=570.78s)]
*  And Laura Ann Carlton never even left her store. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=576.78s)]
*  She was shot after the guy tried to pull down the pride flag. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=581.78s)]
*  She was shot once and then the guy shot through the store window and then ran off and he was [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=586.78s)]
*  tracked down by the San Bernardino County Sheriff. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=591.78s)]
*  And after a confrontation during which he shot at deputies, they shot him to death. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=594.78s)]
*  It seems, again, when this first happened, it seemed like it, you know, when you get [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=601.78s)]
*  early details of a report like this, you want to make sure that it is what it appears to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=606.78s)]
*  be. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=610.78s)]
*  It appeared to be motivated by hatred and motivated by hatred at the queer folks and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=611.78s)]
*  the flag. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=617.78s)]
*  It seems subsequently the reporting that we have about the public profile of the shooter [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=618.78s)]
*  would seem to confirm that that was the motivation. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=623.78s)]
*  I would say it certainly confirms it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=627.78s)]
*  Right after they announced who he was, I went and found his profile on GAB, which is a social [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=630.78s)]
*  media website, as well as his profile on X or Twitter. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=634.78s)]
*  And he had posted all kinds of homophobic, anti-police, anti-abortion stuff on his profiles. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=639.78s)]
*  He had even called for potentially killing police. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=647.78s)]
*  And then I looked a little further into him today through court records and I found that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=650.78s)]
*  his father was actually a Florida Highway Patrol state trooper. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=655.78s)]
*  So that was a little odd. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=658.78s)]
*  His parents were divorced and he'd moved out to California a bunch of years ago. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=660.78s)]
*  And he had claimed on social media that he and his mother were homeless and that his [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=664.78s)]
*  father wasn't providing for them. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=668.78s)]
*  But, yeah, everything you see and everything we found out right after this occurred seems [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=669.78s)]
*  to be borne out by what he was posting himself on his social media. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=674.78s)]
*  I'm wondering how this is reverberating in that town, such a shocking and horrifying [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=678.78s)]
*  act of violence and so clearly motivated by hate. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=685.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I went out there yesterday and people were showing up all day outside the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=689.78s)]
*  store and dropping off flowers and dropping off more pride flags. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=694.78s)]
*  And I would kind of track people down as they walked away and people were crying and hugging [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=698.78s)]
*  each other. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=703.78s)]
*  It's a very close-knit community right in that strip mall where all these shop owners [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=704.78s)]
*  have their places and everyone's just completely torn apart by this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=708.78s)]
*  You know, that flag, you know, it was a sort of radical act to display that flag for a [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=713.78s)]
*  long time, particularly in my youth and walking around when I passed Stonewall and Christopher [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=719.78s)]
*  Street and the village and other places. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=724.78s)]
*  And then over time, I felt less radical, more normalized, more central as a sort of figure [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=725.78s)]
*  embraced in America. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=731.78s)]
*  And there's been a very concerted effort over the last several years to try to render it [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=732.78s)]
*  anathema again. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=738.78s)]
*  I wondered if you talked to any queer folks there or how people are feeling about what [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=739.78s)]
*  it means for them and their safety. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=744.78s)]
*  Yeah, in Cedar Glen, it wasn't always the easiest thing to display a flag like that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=746.78s)]
*  I spoke to a store owner who was just a couple of stores down named Bob Stewart, and he's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=752.78s)]
*  a gay man. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=756.78s)]
*  And when Laura Ann Carlton put up the pride flag, he actually warned her. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=757.78s)]
*  He said, you know, I appreciate what you're doing as a gay man, but as a business owner, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=762.78s)]
*  it might not be the wisest decision to have that up. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=767.78s)]
*  And it turned out to be, you know, much worse for her than just a bad business decision. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=769.78s)]
*  Now, Goldberg, as a writer at the Los Angeles Times, did some great reporting there in the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=775.78s)]
*  aftermath of this awful atrocity. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=779.78s)]
*  Thank you so much for making some time for us. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=781.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Chris. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=784.78s)]
*  We'll see you next time. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDSdj9DKis&t=787.78s)]
