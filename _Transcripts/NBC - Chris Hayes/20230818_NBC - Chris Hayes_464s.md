# Asa Hutchinson: I will prosecute Trump at the debate—whether he's there or not
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM)
*  Two days before the criminally indicted frontrunners' deadline to surrender to justice, the rest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Republican candidates for president will hold their first debate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=5.36s)]
*  The New York Times got its hands on the debate packet for Ron DeSantis, which was apparently [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=8.44s)]
*  accidentally published online. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=13.36s)]
*  It's a pretty funny document. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=15.66s)]
*  It tells DeSantis to defend Donald Trump, who reportedly has chosen not to show up at the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=17.28s)]
*  debate, and to hammer Vivek Ramaswamy, who is rocketing up the polls in New Hampshire [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=21.2s)]
*  as both Trump and DeSantis decline. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=26.32s)]
*  That strategy, those details, those two lines just kind of perfectly encapsulate the bizarro [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=29.84s)]
*  world of a Republican presidential primary, in which there is one commanding frontrunner, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=33.92s)]
*  the guy who tried to undo the American Republic facing four criminal trials, found by his [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=39.08s)]
*  jury to be liable for sexual abuse, but none of the other candidates want to actually take [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=42.68s)]
*  him on, except for Chris Christie, who will be at the debate, and former Governor Asa [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=47.18s)]
*  Hutchinson of Arkansas, who as of now has not met the donor requirements to make the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=52.0s)]
*  debate stage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  Governor Asa Hutchinson joins me now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=58.6s)]
*  He was governor of Arkansas from 2015 until this year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  It's good to have you on, sir. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=63.88s)]
*  First, tell me about your status on the, I will admit that the metrics for making it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=65.56s)]
*  got a little in the weeds for me to stay on top of. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=71.52s)]
*  So where are you in terms of that? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=75.16s)]
*  Well thanks, Chris, and we're going to make the debate. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=79.2s)]
*  And the RNC requires 40,000 unique donors to make the debate stage. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=83.4s)]
*  We're getting close. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=90.28s)]
*  We've got till Monday, close of business, to make that 40,000. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=91.28s)]
*  And so asa2024.com is where you go to make sure I get on the debate stage. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  And I'm not going to defend Donald Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  I will be a prosecutor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=102.84s)]
*  I will be telling the truth on Donald Trump and whether he's there or not. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  He will be a focal point of issue, both what happened on January 6th, but also how he [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=109.02s)]
*  will not lead the Republican Party well into the future. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=114.42s)]
*  So this sort of encapsulates the issue here, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=119.22s)]
*  The bind everyone's in. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=123.22s)]
*  You and Chris Christie, at least, have a theory of the case, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=125.46s)]
*  Donald Trump, the frontrunner, is unfit for office. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=128.42s)]
*  He shouldn't be the president. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=130.56s)]
*  And also, he's a political liability. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=131.56s)]
*  I think both you and Christie think he's actually not a strong nominee. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=133.46s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=138.42s)]
*  The problem is, Republicans don't seem to want to hear that, like the vast majority [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=139.42s)]
*  of the base, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  So I mean, like, our viewers might like that, but like, they're probably not voting in the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=147.01999999999998s)]
*  Republican primary. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=151.42s)]
*  The question is, like, how do you make that case to the people that most need to hear it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=152.42s)]
*  Well, great question. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=157.82s)]
*  And of course, I'm in Iowa. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=159.22s)]
*  And the sense I get in Iowa is that Donald Trump is in the default position right now [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=160.61999999999998s)]
*  until they decide where they want to go as to the best alternative. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=165.82s)]
*  The debate will play a key role in that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=170.22s)]
*  But let me assure you that the Iowans that I talk to recognize if we're going to win, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=172.62s)]
*  we've got to go in a different direction. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  There's too much smoke there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  And they're really discouraged by it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=181.62s)]
*  So the debate is that opportunity for me to make sure that we showcase the alternative, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=183.22s)]
*  a different direction from Donald Trump, and hold him accountable as he should be. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=189.42s)]
*  You know, let me ask you this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=195.22s)]
*  This is a question I'm obsessed with. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=197.22s)]
*  Now, I don't really have a dog in this fight. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=198.62s)]
*  It's, you know, who are the Republicans? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=200.22s)]
*  Nominated aside from my love of our country and America's constitutional democracy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=202.22s)]
*  And one thing that I just feel like would keep me up at nights, if I were anyone who [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=208.02s)]
*  worked in Republican politics, is this kind of nightmare scenario, timing-wise, where [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=212.02s)]
*  Trump rolls to win the nomination and he secures it just as he goes on trial for the gravest [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=216.62s)]
*  political crime since secession and maybe is convicted. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=224.02s)]
*  And then it's like, it's the summer, maybe it's before or after the RNC, the Republican [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=227.22s)]
*  party's got this nominee who's just been convicted. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=230.82000000000002s)]
*  That just seems like a nightmare. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  And no one in the Republican party seems nearly as freaked out about that as I am when I think about it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=234.62s)]
*  Well, it's a realistic possibility. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=242.22s)]
*  And I've actually made the case that you were in a terrible position in Iowa, New Hampshire, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=244.22s)]
*  because these federal cases and state cases are not going to be resolved with Donald Trump [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=250.22s)]
*  before they start voting in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary and probably [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=256.82s)]
*  even Super Tuesday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=261.82s)]
*  And so what are the voters supposed to do? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=263.42s)]
*  And so that's where I think you'll see a gradual shift. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=265.42s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=268.42s)]
*  By speaking the truth, by reality coming to them that we can't win with Donald Trump and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=269.82s)]
*  we have to go a different direction. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=275.52s)]
*  What I think they're looking at is who's going to be that alternative. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=277.32s)]
*  And of course, that's what we're fighting for. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=280.32s)]
*  And that'll be a focus of the debate coming up next Wednesday. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=282.32s)]
*  Well, that's the interesting question, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=286.32s)]
*  Like who is going to be that alternative? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  I really think there's there's two categories. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  I think you and Chris Christie are making a case. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=291.82s)]
*  The front runner is unfit to serve and a political liability. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=295.12s)]
*  So and here's what I've done. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=297.92s)]
*  You're both ex-governors. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=300.12s)]
*  Here's why I'd be a good president. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  Everyone else seems to be just kind of like waiting around for the guy to like end up in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=303.02s)]
*  the clink or like be like beamed up to Mars or something. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=306.92s)]
*  And what are they like? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=311.42s)]
*  What's how is that going to work? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=314.42s)]
*  Well, and that's where I believe that you have to be clear on what happened on January [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=316.12s)]
*  6th. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=323.42s)]
*  You can't be intimidated by a teenager who asked you a question as to what happened on [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=323.92s)]
*  January 6th and what your views. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=328.82s)]
*  It was an attack on our democracy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=330.72s)]
*  And so on the debate next Wednesday, there's not just going to be a difference with Donald Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=333.72s)]
*  There'll be a difference between the candidates. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=337.42s)]
*  Some of the candidates will be defending Donald Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=339.12s)]
*  I'll certainly be on the side of telling the truth. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  But that's a defining moment. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=344.62s)]
*  Who's going to be promising pardons? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=346.22s)]
*  I don't think that's appropriate during a campaign. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=348.22s)]
*  Others do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  And so this is a critical time for us. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=351.72s)]
*  Okay, so you're on the trail. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=354.72s)]
*  You're actually talking to the kinds of now I imagine there's a little selection bias. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=355.92s)]
*  Folks talking to you tend to be interested in your message, but I'm sure you're like, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=359.32s)]
*  what are you getting back? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=363.62s)]
*  What are those back and forth like? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=365.42s)]
*  Do they know who you are? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=367.02s)]
*  Are they like you're the guy who hates Donald Trump and get out of my face? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=367.92s)]
*  Are they like what what are those interactions been like? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=371.02s)]
*  No, actually, it's not like that at all. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=374.92s)]
*  I mean, there's the media intensity on this issue. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  But whenever you talk to Iowans, there's a little bit of discouragement about what they [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  see as unfairness in some instances, but also that our Washington is not working. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  But they're very interested in what's my view of energy policy? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=393.62s)]
*  What's my view of agriculture? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=397.82s)]
*  What's my view of Ukraine? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=400.02000000000004s)]
*  So they get in and ask those subsidy questions. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=401.32s)]
*  And that quite frankly is one of the reasons the debate is going to be exciting next week [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=404.12s)]
*  that we can talk about some real policy issues if Donald Trump's not going to be there, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=408.42s)]
*  even though he'll still be there in spirit and will be a subject that we'll all be talking about. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=412.62s)]
*  Well, I do think it would be good to hear some sort of substantive contentions about [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  how people plan to govern and what they want to do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLcEBeVsoM&t=424.21999999999997s)]
