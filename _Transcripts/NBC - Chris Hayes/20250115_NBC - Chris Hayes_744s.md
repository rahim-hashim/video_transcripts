# ‘Stark warning’: See Maddow, Chris, Joy react to Biden's farewell address
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E)
*  I'm joined now by Rachel Maddow, host of the Rachel Maddow Show, Joy Reid, host of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=0.0s)]
*  Readout, Jen Psaki, host of Inside with Jen Psaki, and Alex Wagner, host of Alex Wagner [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=3.44s)]
*  Tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=7.84s)]
*  And, Rachel, when he got to that turn in the speech, you could just sort of feel everything [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=8.84s)]
*  kind of go to a different level. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=14.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=16.6s)]
*  You know, Chris, I had wondered heading into this speech whether he was going to try to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=17.6s)]
*  give some sort of warning to the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  When we had advice, basically planning advice, that the speech might not be very long. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=25.56s)]
*  And when we saw the White House today release what they called a letter, but was really [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=32.8s)]
*  about a hundred plus page long book explaining his view of his own accomplishments during [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  this term, I had wondered, OK, well, they're not taking a lot of time in this speech. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=43.4s)]
*  They have spelled out the list of accomplishments in writing ahead of the speech. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=48.2s)]
*  So maybe this speech is going to be for something else. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=54.88s)]
*  Maybe this is going to be a warning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=57.24s)]
*  I did not expect it to be this stark. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=58.6s)]
*  As you said, he just he said tonight there is an oligarchy taking shape in America. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people, a tech [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=67.44s)]
*  industrial complex that poses real dangers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=71.86s)]
*  He talked about a tide of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  not just saying misinformation and disinformation are bad on their own, but why are they there? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=81.88s)]
*  They are there to enable the abuse of power. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  He talked about the free press crumbling, which put a shiver down my spine and then [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  talked about how truth is being sacrificed for lies for the purposes of power and profit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  So this is important because he has essentially decided not to brag on the way out about what [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  he did. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=106.84s)]
*  He did a little of that, but really he's taken this last moment to say here is what we've [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=107.84s)]
*  got right now and this is why this is not just dangerous because it doesn't sound American. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=111.16s)]
*  It's dangerous because this is what they're doing to you with this oligarchy, with this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=115.72s)]
*  concentration of power and what with what they're doing to the press and the truth. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=119.96s)]
*  And that is stark and sober. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=124.22s)]
*  And like I said, it put a chill down my spine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=127.0s)]
*  I think he's correct. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=130.56s)]
*  And I'm glad he took this time to say it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=131.56s)]
*  Joy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah, this struck me as two speeches. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=135.0s)]
*  The first speech you could say is that so Biden. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=137.12s)]
*  Biden is a true nostalgic candidate in a way that Trump is as well, but they're nostalgic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=140.2s)]
*  for different reasons. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he genuinely believes if you've been paying attention to Joe Biden over the last [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  many, many, many years, he genuinely believes in the American project. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=149.64s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=153.32s)]
*  He believes in all of the rose colored glass ideas about America, and he will always lead [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=154.32s)]
*  with that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=159.76s)]
*  And he did that for the first half of the speech, talking about the Statue of Liberty, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=160.76s)]
*  giving that moving story about the people who built it and then sort of closing with [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=164.24s)]
*  that as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=167.92s)]
*  But that second part of the speech, to Rachel's point, that was the speech because Joe Biden, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=169.04s)]
*  while he is a nostalgia politician, he also in some ways is an aggressively progressive [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=174.08s)]
*  politician in a certain way in that he really does believe in re centering what could be [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=181.28s)]
*  called America first. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=187.6s)]
*  He believes that if you're going to have the A.I. industry, it needs to be in America. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=189.16s)]
*  He really aggressively believes in repatriating some of this sort of internationalized commerce [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  that has really hurt the working class and bringing it back. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  And he's actually proven it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=203.44s)]
*  He's done it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=204.84s)]
*  He stood by the unions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=205.84s)]
*  But that part where he then gives this warning that could have really that we've been talking [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=206.84s)]
*  about on this air, right, this concentration of power in the hands of this tech industrial [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=212.16s)]
*  complex, the smothering of the lies being smothered for power and profit, saying the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=217.56s)]
*  people must govern, essentially saying that this thing that he loves so much, this America, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=223.48s)]
*  is literally being essentially stolen by the oligarchs who've tried to do it before. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=230.36s)]
*  And he talked about having to bust the trusts after the Gilded Age. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=237.04s)]
*  And he did reference Eisenhower because Eisenhower turned out to be right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=241.6s)]
*  We have been consumed by a military industrial complex that feeds on war and feeds on the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=246.58s)]
*  pain of war and on the cost of war and makes the Pentagon unassailable, its budget. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=252.58s)]
*  But now you do see this concentration of power by tech oligarchs who have seized control [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=258.14s)]
*  of our politics and are about to have an office in the Eisenhower building in our capital [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=263.94s)]
*  that are about to essentially co-run this country with the incoming president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  Biden is not a radical, but it's going to strike, I think, a lot of people on the right [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=275.86s)]
*  as that being a radical thing for a president to say. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  But it needed to be said and it needed to be said from the oval. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  And I'm glad that he did. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=287.76s)]
*  Let me, I want to come to you, Alex and Jen, let me just, I want to play that clip again [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=289.5s)]
*  just to reset it, when he talked about the oligarchy, which was just a striking moment [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=292.86s)]
*  just using that word and saying it so plainly. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  He talks about today an oligarchy is taking shape. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=301.26s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=303.54s)]
*  Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=306.18s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=312.5s)]
*  for everyone to get ahead. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=318.98s)]
*  We see the consequences all across America and we've seen it before. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=322.38s)]
*  More than a century ago, the American people stood up to the Robert Barons back then and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=327.5s)]
*  busted the trust. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=334.32s)]
*  They didn't punish the wealthy, just made the wealthy pay by the rules everybody else [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=336.82s)]
*  had to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=341.44s)]
*  Alex. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=342.44s)]
*  When he said that you and I were both on set looking at each other like Joe Biden just [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=343.44s)]
*  said oligarchy and his closing address to Americans, it's very clear that he was thinking [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=347.2s)]
*  about, I think, an image that we've all sort of projected in advance, which is the fact [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=352.52s)]
*  that Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman are going to be on the dais [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=356.14s)]
*  at the inauguration for Donald Trump. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=359.82s)]
*  Joe Biden has been very vocal about the fact that Metta is ending fact checking. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=362.04s)]
*  He brought it up again in this series of remarks. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=365.5s)]
*  These pictures are already haunting him in the closing days of his presidency. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  But it's also it's not just that concentration of power that he clearly thinks of as a direct [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=373.6s)]
*  threat to democracy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=378.54s)]
*  He also called out the Supreme Court to go out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=379.56s)]
*  This is Joe Biden who wouldn't say a bad word about the court. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, can I just say props to him for mentioning the free press because he has [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=385.68s)]
*  had a complicated relationship in terms of access, giving for the press access to this [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  particular presidency. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  But he is an institutionalist to the core for him to call out the Supreme Court in the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=395.32s)]
*  way that he did call for term limits, call for an enforceable code of ethics and call [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=400.28s)]
*  out their decision on presidential immunity is someone who I'm with joy on this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=405.12s)]
*  He believes in the American project, but it is clear that that vision he has, that belief [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=410.56s)]
*  he has is very much frayed at the edges as he says goodbye to the presidency. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=415.32s)]
*  Jen, if you had to pick if you had to do the sort of one hundred and forty character version [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=419.56s)]
*  of Madison's insight in constitutional governance, it's that concentration of power leads to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=423.92s)]
*  abuse of power. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=428.72s)]
*  And that is precisely the warning that we were getting from someone that you that you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=429.72s)]
*  worked for and saw up close over part of what is one of the longest careers in American [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=433.88s)]
*  politics. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=438.24s)]
*  That that's exactly right. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=439.24s)]
*  And someone, as Alex just said, is an institutionalist who believes in the peaceful transfer of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=440.6s)]
*  power, who believes of the power of the presidency, even when it's held by different parties. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=444.96s)]
*  And what I was really struck by everything you all said, of course, was also the tone. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=450.4s)]
*  He's not if you look back at Joe Biden's speeches and I was there for many of them, I was in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  many preps for many of them. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  Typically, he does a more traditional announcement of the policy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=459.64s)]
*  This is what we're doing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=463.24s)]
*  He doesn't speak as frequently as directly to the American public as he just did in that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  speech. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=470.0s)]
*  And I wrote down he started from the beginning and the order of events is also a choice here [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=471.04s)]
*  in any speech, especially one that's this short, because a more traditional Joe Biden's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=476.52s)]
*  speech would have started with a listicle of accomplishments, which is, I think, what [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=480.8s)]
*  I expected. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=484.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=485.56s)]
*  And instead, he started out with what was almost kind of this lengthy analogy about [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=486.56s)]
*  the Statue of Liberty and standing up to a storm, a storm, the storm we can all assume [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=490.8s)]
*  is Donald Trump and the Trump administration. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=495.1s)]
*  And he said in the early part, it's about who we are and who we stand for. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=497.98s)]
*  And the rest of the speech seemed to be setting up not for what government and the Supreme [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=502.3s)]
*  Court and Congress and the president who's going to sit here is going to do to protect [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=507.06s)]
*  you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  But you are going to protect yourself. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  And I am not passing the baton to my successor, as he would do if it were Mitt Romney or someone [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=513.62s)]
*  else. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=519.38s)]
*  I'm passing it to you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=520.38s)]
*  In the last line, where he said, it is now your turn to stand guard, which is so striking [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=522.54s)]
*  because it really, for me, kind of meets the moment that we're in, which is that you're [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=528.02s)]
*  looking at a person who is going to be an embracer of the oligarchs, who Alex just mentioned, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=534.38s)]
*  the main leaders of these tech companies, who are probably going to have, we'll see, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=539.42s)]
*  unfettered access to the Oval Office. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=543.2199999999999s)]
*  You have a Supreme Court they're controlling. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=545.18s)]
*  They are not protecting you, American public, from these threats we're facing. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=547.42s)]
*  You have to protect yourselves, all of us, and also the institutions he started the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=551.4s)]
*  speech talking about. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=556.92s)]
*  Yeah, this wasn't a, I know everyone feels scared and panicked right now, but you're [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=558.28s)]
*  going to be okay, Carol. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=562.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=563.84s)]
*  No. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=564.84s)]
*  No. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=565.84s)]
*  It's not the speech, Alex. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=566.84s)]
*  It also, in a weird way, wasn't about Donald Trump. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=567.84s)]
*  Like, Donald Trump is the sort of harbinger of a doom that is much broader, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  He's talking about institutional atrophy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=575.52s)]
*  He's talking about the corruption of American democracy, the crumbling of a free press. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=577.64s)]
*  I mean, as much as people would like to blame all of that on Donald Trump and magazine, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=581.84s)]
*  the roots of that extend far beyond that, which I think is why you see a pivot towards [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=585.64s)]
*  not just like Trump, who by the way the American people elected, but a refocusing on sort of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=589.78s)]
*  civic duty in this hour, right? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=594.92s)]
*  You guys elected him. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  Understand that there's a lot of swirl here, and it's going to be up to you to stand watch. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=598.88s)]
*  Rachel, this has been a theme, I think, of your coverage throughout this period of the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=603.84s)]
*  kind of the duty falling to the citizen. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=607.8s)]
*  It's something that Barack Obama has talked about as well, and that last line that Jen [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=610.24s)]
*  highlights is that like, I pass the baton of standing guard to you, the citizen. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=614.8s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, the other thing he said right at the close of the speech, he said, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=620.56s)]
*  I love the United States of America, and you do too. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=624.84s)]
*  He's trying to evoke in all of us a sense of a thing that we love, that we need to be [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=628.88s)]
*  protected. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=635.04s)]
*  We need to be reminded that we love it, and so we need to act to protect it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=636.04s)]
*  And part of that means, I mean, when you're talking about an oligarchy that's based in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  tech, that's based in information, that's based in the currency of truth and attention, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=646.28s)]
*  there really is a call to the individual to try to hold on to our civic responsibility [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=652.6s)]
*  and hold on to reality as a basis of keeping citizenship alive, of making sure that we [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=659.0s)]
*  know what's going on in the world. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=666.76s)]
*  I mean, that's why he said the thing about social media and not doing fact checking. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  That's why he said the thing about the free press crumbling. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=672.0s)]
*  I mean, he made a bunch of news here. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=674.72s)]
*  He talked about wanting 18-year term limits for the Supreme Court. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=677.4s)]
*  He wants a constitutional amendment so that there isn't bizarre presidential immunity [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=681.16s)]
*  for anything a president does. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=685.48s)]
*  He made news at the outset by explaining that this ceasefire between Gaza and Israel was [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=687.04s)]
*  negotiated by his administration. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=692.92s)]
*  And yes, they kept the Trump folks in the loop because they're going to have to implement [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=695.76s)]
*  it, but it was Biden's administration that negotiated it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=700.52s)]
*  I mean, all of that was news and good to get. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  But this was a love letter to America for an outgoing president who is very worried [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=706.52s)]
*  about what he describes as oligarchy, and he thinks that we as individual citizens are [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=711.92s)]
*  going to have to change the country a lot in order to stop it from this drift that it's [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  on, which he portrayed in very, very ominous terms. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-1iR_s33E&t=720.68s)]
