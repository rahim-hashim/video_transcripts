# ‘Highway robbery’: Musk, Trump yank $80m from NYC bank account over migrant lies
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc)
*  All right, here's a question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=0.0s)]
*  Where does a city keep all of its money? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  The answer is just like everyone else, they keep it in a bank. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  The biggest city in the country, New York City, has accounts at a regular bank. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=8.96s)]
*  And on Wednesday morning, when officials checked the balances, they noticed that $80 million [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  was missing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=17.68s)]
*  And for a time, it wasn't clear where it went or who took it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=18.68s)]
*  And then yesterday afternoon, there was a break in the case, a confession from President [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=21.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, tweeting, quote, I have [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=25.84s)]
*  clawed back the full payment that FEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to New York [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=29.88s)]
*  migrant hotels. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  That's MAGA speak for. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=37.64s)]
*  I took New York's money. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=39.56s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=42.48s)]
*  This is highway robbery. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  The city's controller calling out the federal government for snatching millions of dollars [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=45.76s)]
*  right from New York City's bank accounts, FEMA funds to provide services for migrants, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=49.68s)]
*  including shelters like at the Roosevelt Hotel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  This is the newest lawless gambit by Trump and his unelected co-president, Elon Musk, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=58.02s)]
*  an attempt to basically detonate constitutional governance from within. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  By doing two things, both men have a lot of practice at reneging on contracts, refusing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=66.9s)]
*  to pay people who perform services for them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=71.5s)]
*  So the whole thing starts, as so many of these stories do, with a tweet from Musk. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=74.02000000000001s)]
*  Early Monday morning, the world's richest man tweeted that the Doge team just discovered [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=78.42s)]
*  that FEMA sent $59 million last week to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=81.7s)]
*  sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination of the president's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=87.94s)]
*  executive order that money is meant for American disaster relief instead is being spent on [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=91.62s)]
*  high-end hotels for illegals. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=95.66s)]
*  You'll not be surprised to hear almost all of that's complete bunk, as city officials [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=99.14s)]
*  were quick to point out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=102.94s)]
*  The $59 million Musk is talking about was part of the larger $80 million outlay of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=104.3s)]
*  city. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  Only a fraction of it was used to house migrants, and not a single penny of it came at the expense [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  of any disaster relief. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=113.56s)]
*  In fact, the payment was issued through a grant from the Shelter and Services Program, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=115.34s)]
*  a separate part of the government budget, but it's administered by FEMA and initiated [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=118.78s)]
*  by Congress in 2023 to issue grants to cities and organizations providing services to migrants [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=122.98s)]
*  who have been released from federal custody after crossing the border. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=128.58s)]
*  That is to say, money appropriated by a vote in Congress, both houses, approved by President [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=131.58s)]
*  Joe Biden, to house legal migrants during an upswing in immigration in the United States. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=135.7s)]
*  It was not to house them in luxury, also, as you might imagine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=142.34s)]
*  It was to convert an old Manhattan hotel into a kind of modern-day Ellis Island where migrants [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=144.86s)]
*  were processed, given a health check, and offered temporary shelter and help. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=149.06s)]
*  Migrants are connected to a case manager who will help them decide next steps. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=154.66s)]
*  If they want to connect with family or friends in a different state, the city will help them [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=159.22s)]
*  get there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=163.06s)]
*  If they need a shelter bed, the city will then assign them to a shelter site and help [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=164.06s)]
*  them get started on filing their asylum papers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  When migrants do get a place to sleep, the city comptroller says, they observe the federal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=171.74s)]
*  program's cap on hotel and shelter prices. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  That cap is currently $12.50 a night. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  $12.50 a night in New York City. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  Okay, those are the facts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=186.86s)]
*  But within hours of must tweet, the Trump White House fired FEMA's chief financial officer [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  and three others for dispersing the legally allocated funds to New York City. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=193.78s)]
*  Again, Congressional appropriated funds to cover an ongoing approved activity. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=197.7s)]
*  And the co-presidents were adding new false details to their lies about the case. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=201.7s)]
*  A hotel has paid $59 million. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=206.82s)]
*  59 million because of, because it's housing migrants, illegal migrants, all illegal, I [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=209.61999999999998s)]
*  believe. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  And they were being paid twice the normal room rate at 100% occupancy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=220.14s)]
*  So it's a racket. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=221.14s)]
*  Based on those lies, they use the powers of the federal government to reach into the city's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  bank account to pluck back $80 million Congress authorized. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=226.86s)]
*  They're taking money out of other people's bank accounts, calling it a clawback of taxpayer [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=230.94000000000003s)]
*  money. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=235.3s)]
*  A lot of other people call it stealing $80 million. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=236.3s)]
*  Brad Landers, New York City comptroller, essentially the city's chief financial officer, and he [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=239.46s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=242.84s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=243.84s)]
*  Okay, walk me through how you discovered this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=244.84s)]
*  So yesterday morning, my chief budget deputy comptroller says $80 million is gone from [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=247.9s)]
*  the treasury account of the Department of Finance. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=253.78000000000003s)]
*  We think it was taken back by the federal government. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=255.82s)]
*  Did you know they could do that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=259.7s)]
*  Never. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=260.98s)]
*  I said, has this ever happened before? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=261.98s)]
*  It is unprecedented. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=263.14s)]
*  They gave us this money. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=265.06s)]
*  As you say, Congress authorized it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=266.18s)]
*  We have a contract, a signed contract. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=268.14s)]
*  We sent them an invoice detailing all those expenses to only $12.50 a night on hotels. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=270.78s)]
*  They sent us the money and approved the invoice. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=276.38s)]
*  And then lo and behold, they just yank it right back. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=279.36s)]
*  It is highway robbery. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  Now, I want to be clear on one technical detail. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  I thought that we discovered that treasury has some secret back end for the financial [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=284.82s)]
*  system to take people's money, which seemed really worrisome. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=288.32s)]
*  This was an ACH payment, which technically can be canceled within five days. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=291.18s)]
*  Although anyone who's ever gotten like a direct deposit knows that when it shows up in your [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  bank, it's in your bank. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  You have the money. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=300.46s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=301.46s)]
*  I mean, we spent it last year. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=302.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=303.46s)]
*  We had actually moved it over the five days since they gave it to us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=304.46s)]
*  So when they actually did the clawback, it caused the account to overdraft by $79.5 million. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=307.24s)]
*  I'm sure the chief financial officer was psyched about that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=313.38s)]
*  On top of that, Citibank, this is an account at Citibank, charged us a $15,000 overdraft [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=318.3s)]
*  fee. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=323.26s)]
*  I'm happy to say I reached out to Citibank and they have refunded the overdraft fee. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=324.26s)]
*  That's menchie of them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=328.5s)]
*  Better believe we're going to keep fighting to get every penny of that $85 million back [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  end they owe it to us. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=333.5s)]
*  I mean, so this was, again, this service, this sort of pot of money was negotiated by [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=334.9s)]
*  members in the House and Senate. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  It was put into legislation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=342.04s)]
*  That legislation was signed by President Biden. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=343.3s)]
*  It's being spent this year. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=345.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=346.94s)]
*  We have a contract. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=347.94s)]
*  And you have a contract. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=348.94s)]
*  You say we're going to do this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=349.94s)]
*  We're going to pay that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=350.94s)]
*  That's the law. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  Do you, is it your position that they are within their legal authority to simply take [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=353.54s)]
*  it back? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=357.26s)]
*  They have no legal authority to take it back. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=358.26s)]
*  I think two different ways. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=359.26s)]
*  Attorney General Tish James is in court on a lawsuit around the federal funding freeze [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=361.02s)]
*  and a Rhode Island judge said they can't do that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=364.36s)]
*  But also we have a contract. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=367.98s)]
*  So one thing I'm very upset about is that same Mayor Adams that was on your A block. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=369.54s)]
*  He won't go into court to say, this is our money. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=374.62s)]
*  You owe it to us. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=377.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, this is, and I have to say you are running for mayor. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=378.5s)]
*  So full disclosure about that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  You want that job. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=384.06s)]
*  But the sitting mayor spent today with Mr. Homan. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=386.5s)]
*  Yesterday he said he was going to ask for the money back, but he didn't ask for the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  money back. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=395.22s)]
*  He just gave Homan whatever he wanted. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=396.22s)]
*  I mean, he is doing the bidding of President Trump and not the bidding of New Yorkers who [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=398.02s)]
*  need that 80 million dollars on all kinds of other things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=401.94s)]
*  I mean, I also have to ask you, since you're here, I mean, we've just watched multiple [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=405.17999999999995s)]
*  attorneys of the Department of Justice, including the Southern District, the acting director. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=409.94s)]
*  You know what a big deal that office is. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=414.05999999999995s)]
*  Multiple attorneys in main justice, the head of the criminal division, the head of the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=416.5s)]
*  public integrity division, multiple deputies between that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=419.29999999999995s)]
*  We have no word from the mayor about any of this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=423.52s)]
*  Apparently he's going to maybe be appearing with Homan at some point. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=425.7s)]
*  This is what we've heard. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=428.86s)]
*  Do you think that the governor of New York is going to be on with Rachel Maddow in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  next hour? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  She has the power to essentially fire the mayor. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you think she should do that? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=437.82s)]
*  I mean, look, right now we don't have a mayor who is working for the people of New York [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=438.82s)]
*  City. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=442.38s)]
*  We have a mayor who is doing the bidding of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=443.38s)]
*  And what more could there be than they take 80 million dollars away from you? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=446.74s)]
*  It's not really even ideological. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=450.7s)]
*  I mean, you guys got to give it back. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=451.7s)]
*  That's our money. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=453.9s)]
*  If he doesn't want to have his go into court, let the law department have me go into court. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=455.82s)]
*  New Yorkers are looking for someone who will fight for them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=459.78s)]
*  And yes, that's why I'm running for mayor. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=462.7s)]
*  That's the leadership that we need. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvgwUgboBc&t=464.65999999999997s)]
