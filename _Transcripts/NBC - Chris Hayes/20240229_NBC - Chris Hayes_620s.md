Video Description: Chris Hayes looks at the historic proof that a quick decision the Supreme Court is possible. “They can still—if they want to—move very quickly. It is still in their power.

# 'Historic proof': If the Supreme Court wanted to move quickly it could
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump is facing many many trials in this election year or at least [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=0.0s)]
*  Cases that could potentially go to trial. We're gonna see if he faces trials [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  We have news on one of them tonight in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=8.96s)]
*  Special counsel Jack Smith is as of just a few hours ago [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=14.96s)]
*  Proposing to the federal court in Florida that that trial should start on July 8th [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=18.44s)]
*  Trump's attorneys are suggesting a trial should start in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=22.96s)]
*  2025 after the election if at all according to court filing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  the judge [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=30.4s)]
*  Appointed by Trump in the lame duck session in 2020 may make a decision on that tomorrow [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=31.96s)]
*  We will watch carefully for that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=37.32s)]
*  But whatever she decides that trial date will then have to go through a legal gauntlet [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=38.72s)]
*  Possibly going up to you guessed at the Supreme Court based on you guessed it again another immunity assertion [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=43.04s)]
*  That Trump is now making in that case even though the crime he committed was not when he was president now [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=49.8s)]
*  How quickly wall that move? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=55.36s)]
*  Well, you see here's the thing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=57.64s)]
*  What the Supreme Court has going for it as an institution by constitutional design [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=60.04s)]
*  Is that it is insulated from electoral politics intentionally? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=64.88s)]
*  I mean we give the justices lifetime tenure in large part to ensure [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Their interpretations of the law are not subject to the whims and the passions of pundits and politicians and parties and even [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=73.36s)]
*  majorities of voters [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=80.08s)]
*  But that independence is a two-sided coin on the flip side comes a danger deep within the court's design [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=81.68s)]
*  That its independence [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=88.42s)]
*  tips over into a kind of reckless lack of accountability and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=90.66s)]
*  One way in which the Supreme Court of the United States is just completely unaccountable is on the basic question of what it does [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=94.78s)]
*  And when it does it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=101.62s)]
*  With a few exceptions like disputes between two different states over water rights and stuff like that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=103.66s)]
*  The court only takes the cases they want to take they reject the ones they don't want [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=109.34s)]
*  The court can adhere to normal procedure when they want to and then they could completely break normal procedure whenever they want to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  When they want to act fast, they can act very very fast when they want to slow walk something they can go very slow [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  Yesterday's one-page announcement that after two and a half weeks of doing Lord knows what they were [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=128.98s)]
*  scheduling arguments on Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity from prosecution for seven weeks from now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=134.72s)]
*  Seems to indicate that a conservative majority of the court does not want to move particularly quickly and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=140.98s)]
*  I would hazard that part of that reason is that to move quickly would be Donald Trump would face an imminent trial for the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=146.5s)]
*  Insurrection he fomented and that would I think appreciably hurt his chances of being the next president [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=153.58s)]
*  But if the Supreme Court justice is wanted to move quickly, they definitely could let me give you a little recent context for this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=159.5s)]
*  Because I think it's important and it can get lost in the procedural weeds [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=164.94s)]
*  Back in December [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=168.58s)]
*  Donald Trump filed a claim saying he was immune from prosecution for trying to overturn the election because he was being charged for acts [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=170.22s)]
*  he committed while he was president and the district judge in that case Tanya Chutkin heard arguments and issued a very well reasoned ruling saying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=177.74s)]
*  Nobody it doesn't work that way quote whatever immunity is a sitting president may enjoy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=186.74s)]
*  The United States has only one chief executive at a time and that position does not confer a lifelong [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=191.34s)]
*  Get out of jail free pass and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=196.7s)]
*  Then the special counsel prosecuting case Jack Smith did something a little novel and even audacious [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=199.5s)]
*  Rather than waiting for Donald Trump to appeal that ruling to the DC Circuit, which is the next step up the ladder [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=205.98s)]
*  Smith said hey, we all know this is gonna end up in the Supreme Court. Let's just go to the Supreme Court now [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  Let's do it. Let's have it out and he applied for this somewhat rare procedural mechanism [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  That's called cert before judgment [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=223.18s)]
*  And what it means is that you basically leapfrog a step you leapfrog the appellate court and you rush straight to the doors of the Supreme [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=225.66s)]
*  Court [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=232.74s)]
*  To save time in this case and also because you know, it's gonna end up there and when he tried to do that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=233.82s)]
*  The Supreme Court responded no, no, no clear jets. We're gonna let the appeals run their course first [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  So now of course another two months have gone by the appellate court has ruled unanimously against Trump [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=246.38s)]
*  They'd issued their own very strong unanimous opinion and then petition back up the Supreme Court and what does the Supreme Court do in response? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=250.98s)]
*  They say you know what actually? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=257.62s)]
*  Check that we do want to hear the case [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=260.34s)]
*  seven weeks from now [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=263.06s)]
*  So the court succeeded in burning more than three months off the calendar and it's I want to be clear here [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=266.38s)]
*  It's not just that they could have gone faster [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=272.42s)]
*  It is that on other recent cases they have shown themselves [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=274.58s)]
*  Extremely ready to jump in and snatch issues from the lower courts when it suits them for instance [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=278.22s)]
*  When President Joe Biden issued an executive order that would have cancelled literally [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=283.74s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars in student debt for millions of our fellow Americans a bunch of Republican states sued to stop the plan [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=288.86s)]
*  They lost their lawsuit at the district level and they appealed and then you know what happened? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=296.94s)]
*  The Supreme Court stepped in and they granted cert before judgment same thing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=301.22s)]
*  Jack Smith wanted to leapfrog the appellate court and take up the case on an expedited basis now [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=306.5s)]
*  Was there something particularly pressing about this case? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=312.02s)]
*  Other than the notion that millions of American students would have their debt cancelled not really I mean it wasn't like a death row appeal [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=315.02s)]
*  But sure enough look at that the court just could not wait they couldn't move fast enough [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=322.98s)]
*  They came together with a conservative majority on incredibly novel legal reasoning and they snatched back that debt [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=327.06s)]
*  Cancellation to make sure that students would have to pay every cent of their student loans [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=332.6s)]
*  They could not move fast enough to make sure no one got their debt cancelled. They were in a real hurry on that one [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=338.52s)]
*  Same process played out in August of 2021 [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=345.72s)]
*  President Biden wanted to extend the Trump administration's pandemic moratorium on evictions [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=348.8s)]
*  So in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic, you don't boot people with their stuff out onto the street [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=354.36s)]
*  Landlords and realtors challenged it and while it was before an appellate court [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  They petitioned the Supreme Court for immediate relief. They said we don't want to wait. We want to jump the line [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=365.28s)]
*  We want to go to the straight Supreme Court just over three weeks [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=370.2s)]
*  After Biden ordered the eviction ban the six conservative justice Supreme Court sprang into action [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=375.0s)]
*  Quickly deciding the moratorium could not stand that. Yes, you can throw people out of their homes [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  Three weeks [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=386.84s)]
*  They had to do whatever it took burn the midnight oil feed the clerks extra helpings of Red Bull to make sure people could start [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=389.4s)]
*  being evicted again [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=396.12s)]
*  Those are just two [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=400.36s)]
*  Obvious examples on this court in recent memory [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=402.36s)]
*  But it's also clearly the case through American history [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=405.24s)]
*  The court can and does move very quickly on high profile cases with national political significance [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=408.12s)]
*  We talked about this case a lot yesterday, you know what you love it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=413.72s)]
*  Us v. Nixon the infamous case in which Richard Nixon refused to hand tape recordings from the Oval Office over to a federal judge [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  in the Watergate scandal [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=423.88s)]
*  Everyone in the country understood this was make or break for Nixon. It was the biggest case of the time [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=425.88s)]
*  Those tapes could prove his involvement in crimes and on July 8th [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=432.6s)]
*  In crimes and on July 8th 1974 the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case when they weren't even in a regular session [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=437.88000000000005s)]
*  A decision is expected in a week or two even before this morning's argument [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  One justice was writing and circulating his ideas another had his clerk prepare a draft opinion [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=451.48s)]
*  With the fate of the republic on the line the court issued their decision just 16 days later [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  The president nixon has not yet responded to the sledgehammer decision of the supreme court today [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=465.08s)]
*  Which ruled that he must immediately turn over tapes of 64 presidential conversations [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=471.0s)]
*  What about bush v. Gore remember that one 2000 election recount in florida [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=477.72s)]
*  Barely a month after the votes were cast and a day one day after florida's highest court ordered a statewide recount [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=481.48s)]
*  The supreme court stepped in they granted the bush campaign an emergency stay to stop florida [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=487.48s)]
*  From counting the votes do not count any more votes [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=494.12s)]
*  The reason that bush wanted that was that the bush campaign was worried that if the recount continued al gore would pull ahead [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=497.08s)]
*  And then one day after granting sir in one of the most expedited cases of all time [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=504.04s)]
*  The conservative court took oral arguments and began deliberating quickly [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=510.12s)]
*  It doesn't get any more tense than this [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=515.4s)]
*  The justice is working for a second night on their historic decision [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=517.48s)]
*  All this waiting for a decision in a case that was after all argued only yesterday [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=521.0s)]
*  The justices seem determined to rule on this case quickly well aware of the coming deadlines for choosing presidential electors [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  Just four days after granting their initial stay by a single vote [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=532.3599999999999s)]
*  The high court permanently stopped the recount and gifted to george w bush a presidential victory [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=535.8s)]
*  So when it comes to making sure that a presidential republican candidate for president gets into office [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=542.04s)]
*  Man the supreme court can really move at the speed of light, can't they? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=547.56s)]
*  The point here is that even though this conservative court seemingly tipped their hand this month by sitting on the trump case for two weeks [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=552.44s)]
*  And then scheduling it for arguments way down the line on april 22nd. They can still if they want to move very quickly [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=559.0s)]
*  It is still in their power [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=566.04s)]
*  And no one should let them off the hook on this massively important and weighty question before the nation [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=568.04s)]
*  Will the man who tried to overthrow the constitutional republic face a trial for those alleged crimes or will he not? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=573.48s)]
*  Nine americans can still decide that donald trump deserves [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=581.4s)]
*  To stand trial to present evidence under our constitution before a jury of his peers to find out whether he is guilty [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=585.48s)]
*  Or he is innocent of what he is charged before hundreds of millions of americans go into a voting booth and see trump's name on their ballot [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=591.8s)]
*  You [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rPGu8PDJ6o&t=603.24s)]
