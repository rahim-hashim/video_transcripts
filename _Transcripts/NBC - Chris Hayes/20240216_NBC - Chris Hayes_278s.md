# See Fox News hosts humiliated as FBI Biden ‘informant’ gets arrested for lying
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s)
*  Last night, we brought you the story of the wildly embarrassing bombshell that has blown [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=0.0s)]
*  up the right wing case against President Joe Biden, the sole surviving son. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=4.44s)]
*  The special counsel investigating the Bidens, Trump appointed U.S. attorney David Weiss, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=8.76s)]
*  has now indicted his own key informant for lying. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Forty-three-year-old Alexander Smirnoff was arrested Wednesday and charged on two counts [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  for feeding the FBI false information. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=22.48s)]
*  Trump's allegation that Joe and Hunter Biden received $5 million bribes from a Ukrainian [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=25.36s)]
*  company has always been manifestly absurd. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=30.36s)]
*  And yet it was the central point of the Republican argument for President Biden's impeachment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=34.24s)]
*  Republican politicians and the right-wing media relied on this discredited informant [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=39.84s)]
*  to make their case over and over and over again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  A veteran FBI informant alleging both the president and Hunter Biden each took $5 million [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=48.92s)]
*  in bribes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=56.32s)]
*  The details come from an FBI informant who is very trusted. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=57.32s)]
*  A highly reliable informant that has always checked out all the information he's ever [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=60.72s)]
*  given us has checked out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=64.5s)]
*  We have determined that Whistleblower is extremely credible. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=65.68s)]
*  This is a very crucial piece of our investigation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  A confidential human source that had been reliable previously to the FBI. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=72.76s)]
*  A confidential informant that they had on the payroll. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=77.64s)]
*  Documented allegations of bribery from a trusted FBI confidential human source has now finally [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=80.44s)]
*  been released. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=87.56s)]
*  Now its contents are devastating. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=88.56s)]
*  Trusted. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=91.0s)]
*  So trusted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  So reliable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Highly credible. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  In fact, in just one year, Sean Hannity, that guy you just saw there, promoted the bogus [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  claims of that so-called trusted informant no less than 85 times on his show. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=100.56s)]
*  About 28 of those segments were Hannity monologues, long ones, on the topic. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=105.68s)]
*  And of course it was a joint effort between Fox News and elected Republicans like Texas [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=109.88s)]
*  podcaster Ted Cruz who talked about an ad nauseum on his thrice weekly program called [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=114.92s)]
*  The Big Cushy Chair or whatever it is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=120.68s)]
*  So you might think given the fact that their entire case just fell apart in the most public [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=122.88s)]
*  and embarrassing way imaginable that at least some of these people would feel they had to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=128.44s)]
*  address it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=132.84s)]
*  Say if you were a Fox News broadcaster who had been repeating what you now know to be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=134.48s)]
*  a lie to your audience for months. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=138.48s)]
*  No, of course they didn't even mention it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=140.48s)]
*  As of last night at least. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=143.32s)]
*  Fox News, take a look at what they were talking about last night when the story broke on Fox [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=144.6s)]
*  News. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=149.12s)]
*  Welcome to Hannity and today was an unmitigated disaster for Fulton County DA Fonny Willis. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=150.12s)]
*  Fonny lines blurred allowing a county DA to bring charges against a former US president [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=158.64s)]
*  is absurd and destructive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=164.88s)]
*  Fonny and the lover boy in the hot seat. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  The Trump Georgia case falls apart. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  But remember this isn't a Fonny and lover boy scandal it's a Biden scandal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=173.27999999999997s)]
*  We also have to remember that Joe Biden at this point is essentially a vegetable. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  Another knock on Joe Biden's leaky bug out of a brain. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=180.88s)]
*  Obama and the CIA caught cooking the books brand new bombshells. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=183.92s)]
*  Just the usual charming content across all of Fox News prime time last night during this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  big story there were zero mentions of their favorite FBI informant zero. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=196.27999999999997s)]
*  Now tonight they might get to it once they've gotten their story straight break it to their [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  audience the person they've been relying on for over a year with this ludicrous claim wasn't [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=205.1s)]
*  telling the truth has in fact been arrested for making it up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  But you know we know this Fox News is not a journalistic organization. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=212.84s)]
*  Their purpose is to create an alternate reality for their viewers where they hear only what [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=216.44000000000003s)]
*  the conservative movement wants them to hear. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=221.08s)]
*  We know that because they paid out the largest media defamation settlement in all of US history [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=223.34s)]
*  to the tune of nearly 800 million dollars create for creating the alternate reality [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  the election was stolen from Donald Trump and we know they knew that was false. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  Believe me they saw the news about their number one informant yesterday they just chose to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=238.68s)]
*  ignore it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  How embarrassing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  Here I was thinking Sean Hannity always wants to set the record straight. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  Again on this show we always want to set the record straight. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_ir8TeJ04s&t=249.95999999999998s)]
