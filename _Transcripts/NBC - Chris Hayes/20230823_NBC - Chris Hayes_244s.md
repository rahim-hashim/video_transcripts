# Trump co-defendants Meadows, Clark lose bid to delay arrests in Georgia
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc)
*  Tanya Miller is a Georgia State representative who served as a prosecutor in the Fulton County [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=0.0s)]
*  District Attorney's Office alongside Fonny Willis, and she joins me now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=4.7s)]
*  First, I just want to ask about these motions made by both Jeffrey Clark and Mark Meadows [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=8.76s)]
*  to not just remove the case to federal court, but to not have to appear in Fulton County [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=16.14s)]
*  jail and be processed at all. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=21.42s)]
*  What do you make of those, and were you surprised or not surprised by the judges ruling that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=25.62s)]
*  they can't do that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=29.22s)]
*  Chris, no, I was not surprised that they asked for that, and I also was not surprised that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=30.22s)]
*  the judge denied that fairly swiftly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=38.34s)]
*  As we know, and we've been talking about these motions to remove the case from state court [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=41.3s)]
*  to federal court, center around this idea that they were sort of federal employees or [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  acting at the behest of federal employees doing federal business when they were allegedly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=51.22s)]
*  colluding to steal the election down here in Georgia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  I think that motion is going to be denied eventually. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  What they did, though, recently was ask Judge Jones, who is an Obama appointee, a fairly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=65.7s)]
*  straight middle of the road, moderate federal judge, a real stickler for the rules, as most [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=72.0s)]
*  federal judges are. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=78.6s)]
*  They asked the judge to stop Fonny Willis from arresting Mark Meadows as he litigated [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=80.02s)]
*  his motion to have the case removed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  Of course, there's no basis in the law or statute for that kind of freezing, and Judge [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=89.08s)]
*  Jones swiftly told them that, look, there is nothing in the removal statute that would [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  allow me to stop Fonny Willis from arresting you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=97.86s)]
*  We will get to your motion in due time as it is scheduled for next week, but in the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=101.72s)]
*  meantime, you're on your own as it relates to that arrest warrant that's pending in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=105.38s)]
*  Fulton County. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  It's funny you say that because when I saw that they had filed those motions, I asked [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  my wife, who's a law scholar and legal expert, I was like, wait, can you do that? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  And she's like, I don't think there's much there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=119.38s)]
*  I don't think you can. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  You can file your motions after you've turned yourself in and been arrested, but that's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=122.94s)]
*  probably a bridge too far. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  Do you think, what do you anticipate in terms of the scene in Fulton County tomorrow, obviously [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=128.7s)]
*  with the ex-president showing up, obviously, you know, this is folks with quite a retinue. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=135.58s)]
*  There's security issues, but it seems like they've hammered out something that they can [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  get this done tomorrow. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=145.58s)]
*  Well, certainly, Chris, I expect it to be somewhat of a circus. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=146.58s)]
*  We already have tons of cameras and attention and protesters and supporters all sort of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  descending on the Fulton County courthouse and the Fulton County jail. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=157.82000000000002s)]
*  I think with the surrendering of the former president, we should see more of that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=162.38s)]
*  But I suspect all of the details have been worked out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  The former president will probably pretty smoothly get into the jail, get booked, get [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=172.1s)]
*  fingerprinted, get his photo taken, his mugshot taken and be out pretty quickly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=177.1s)]
*  But listen, this is a historic day, not just for Fulton County, not just for Georgia, but [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=184.34s)]
*  for the United States of America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=190.42s)]
*  We have a former president who is being booked into the Fulton County jail, one of the actually [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=191.98s)]
*  the busiest jail in the state of Georgia, one of the busiest jails in this country for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=197.06s)]
*  serious felony charges. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=202.98s)]
*  So I expect this will not be a regular day in Fulton County tomorrow. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=205.98s)]
*  But the folks who show up and do their jobs every day will do what they've been doing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=209.9s)]
*  And that is trying to to play the hand that they've been dealt and make this move as [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=214.62s)]
*  smoothly as possible for everybody involved. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=219.3s)]
*  All right, Tanya Miller, thank you as always for your time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EccJlzgY2gc&t=221.82000000000002s)]
