# Bombshell reporting Justice Alito dumped Bud Light stock during MAGA boycott
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM)
*  When you venture out into the world, you may find yourself in a job or a community or a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=0.0s)]
*  social setting where you will be pressured to endorse ideas you don't believe or to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=5.36s)]
*  abandon core beliefs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  It will be up to you to speak out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=12.96s)]
*  That was Supreme Court Justice Samuel Lido speaking earlier this month to graduates of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=15.52s)]
*  Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio, one of the spiritual centers of the anti-abortion [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=20.66s)]
*  movement. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=26.52s)]
*  The school consistently ranked as one of the most conservative colleges in America. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=27.52s)]
*  Its website stresses time and time again how central the school has been in the long movement [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  to criminalize abortion in America since Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=35.84s)]
*  Little do we know then that Alito's family had already lived out his advice in their [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=39.2s)]
*  own Northern Virginia community. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=43.84s)]
*  Right after the January 6th insurrection as the Supreme Court was considering an election [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=46.04s)]
*  case, by flying the United States flag upside down on the front lawn of their house, a perversely [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=49.92s)]
*  anti-patriotic symbol adopted by Donald Trump stopped the steel supporters to protest Joe [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=56.42s)]
*  Biden's victory. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=61.82s)]
*  An open nod to the insurrectionists. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=63.46s)]
*  That's shocking, shocking behavior out of a sitting Supreme Court Justice. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=66.14s)]
*  It's all the more shocking because Alito didn't dispute what the inverted flag stood for. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=70.26s)]
*  In an email statement to the New York Times, he just said it was his wife's idea to fly [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=75.76s)]
*  it to troll the libs in their neighborhood over their own yard signs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=79.54s)]
*  Almost sounds like Alito was saying he'd found himself in a social setting being pressured [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=84.86s)]
*  to endorse ideas he didn't believe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=88.7s)]
*  But then the news broke about some stock trades Alito made last summer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=91.7s)]
*  That August there was that hokey performative right-wing effort to boycott Bud Light because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=95.68s)]
*  the company had provided a single trans influencer with one can of beer. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=100.42s)]
*  It's a little hard to remember just what a crazy cause celeb the Bud Light boycott became [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=106.34s)]
*  in the MAGA fever swamps. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=111.2s)]
*  But here, let a heavily armed kid rock remind you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=112.94000000000001s)]
*  Bud Light and Ann Hyzer Bush, have a terrific day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=127.94000000000001s)]
*  Now while that boycott was raging last August, according to a search of financial records [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=133.62s)]
*  by legal reporter Chris Guidener, Justice Alito sold a chunk of stock in Bud Light's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=139.06s)]
*  parent company, Ann Hyzer Bush, and he bought shares of Coors on the same day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=144.34s)]
*  Kid Rock was out shooting up Bud Light cases and Sam Alito was selling his Ann Hyzer Bush [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=150.98s)]
*  stock. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  Now you could say, well I don't know, maybe just a coincidence, if it weren't for everything [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  else we know about Sam Alito. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=161.66s)]
*  The guy who just got an honorary degree and standing ovation from a conservative Christian [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=163.62s)]
*  college for authoring the Dove's decision that finally undid Roe v. Wade. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=167.9s)]
*  A decision that curiously got leaked ahead of time, the full text of it, just like the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=170.9s)]
*  Hobby Lobby decision apparently that he authored that gave businesses the right to impose their [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=175.78s)]
*  religious beliefs on employees. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=180.98s)]
*  In fact, the more you examine Alito's public comments, not just in his decisions but in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=182.98s)]
*  oral arguments before the court like the immunity arguments a few weeks ago, in public speeches [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  at conservative schools, in organizations like the Federalist Society, the more he looks [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=191.9s)]
*  and sounds like what I think he is, a far right, MAGA loving extremist. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=195.68s)]
*  There's millions of them in America. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=200.4s)]
*  And nothing more explicitly confirms that than the fact that Alito and his wife apparently [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=202.84s)]
*  flew the symbol of an anti-democratic extremist movement over their own home. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj1gaGS__IM&t=207.5s)]
