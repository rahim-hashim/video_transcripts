Video Description: "Right now, we have President Elon Musk. And Donald Trump—maybe he's vice president. I guess vice presidents don't do much, so that makes sense. He might be the chief of staff. I don't know what you call him, but he is not calling the shots," says Rep. Dan Goldman.

# Trump is ‘chief of staff’ to ‘President Musk’ at this point, says Rep. Goldman
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE)
*  Congressman Dan Goldman is a Democrat in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=0.0s)]
*  He serves on the Oversight Committee and he joins me now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=2.4s)]
*  Congressman, it occurs to me that the founders, they made their mistakes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=4.84s)]
*  But they had one president, I think, for a reason. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=9.36s)]
*  You're sort of seeing the problem with the co-president model, which is that if the two [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=12.76s)]
*  co-presidents don't agree, it's really hard to get anything. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=17.64s)]
*  The two co-presidents elect, I get. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=20.76s)]
*  But I just think, I can't actually understand who's where on what that you could get a path forward. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=22.84s)]
*  Well, let's clarify one thing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=32.28s)]
*  There does appear to be one president. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  It's Elon Musk, who has his own very self-interested view of everything, including the fact that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  he wanted to remove restrictions on US companies investing in China. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=44.5s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=50.44s)]
*  So, he has his own interests related solely to his own federal contracts, his own business interests. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=52.04s)]
*  He has no idea how government operates or how government runs, but he spent nearly $300 [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=60.28s)]
*  million to get Donald Trump elected. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=66.88s)]
*  There are rumors that he is going to use X to buy or merge with Truth Social, which would [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=69.56s)]
*  give Donald Trump a tremendous windfall. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=75.16s)]
*  Elon Musk has Donald Trump in a vice, and it is very clear that Elon Musk is now calling the shots. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=78.0s)]
*  There's no way Donald Trump was not aware of what these negotiations were for weeks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=86.32s)]
*  and weeks and weeks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=92.08s)]
*  And for the fact that he would just drop in the debt ceiling limit at the 11th hour after [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=93.8s)]
*  they had, Mike Johnson and the Republicans had reached a bipartisan deal is preposterous. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=101.0s)]
*  But that's because of Elon Musk. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=106.8s)]
*  So we need to face the reality. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=109.08s)]
*  Right now, we have President Elon Musk. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=110.48s)]
*  And Donald Trump, maybe he's vice president. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  I guess vice presidents don't do much, so that makes sense. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=115.8s)]
*  He might be the chief of staff. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what you call him, but he is not calling the shots. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=120.84s)]
*  Yeah, you just pointed out, I just want to linger for two seconds because I spent some [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  time on the almost $200 million for pediatric cancer research, which again, this is a hot [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=127.28s)]
*  take and I understand people probably might disagree with this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=133.36s)]
*  I think that's a good thing for the federal government to spend money on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=136.2s)]
*  It's a bipartisan thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  So I'm pro that there's two other things that they dropped. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=141.32s)]
*  One is there were going to be investment outbound investment limits, Americans investing in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  China. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  That was also bipartisan and honestly, kind of MAGA America first inflected in certain [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  ways. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  That's been dropped. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=156.04s)]
*  And the other was reformed to the pharmacy benefit administrators who have taken over [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=157.04s)]
*  chunk of drug purchasing in this country and who are, according to all evidence, jacking [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=162.64s)]
*  prices up and they were going to, there was some really bipartisan reforms to bring those [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=167.88s)]
*  farmer prices down. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=172.44s)]
*  That also got taken out, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=174.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=176.32s)]
*  And think about this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  This bipartisan deal would have lowered prescription drug prices. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  It would have allowed food stamp recipients to get refunds for when their cards, their [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  EBT cards are stolen and they have no money to buy food. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=189.28s)]
*  It would have provided a tremendous amount of disaster relief, of course, and it would [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=194.16s)]
*  have provided additional health care extenders that are essential for people to get their [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  health care. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  You mentioned the pediatric cancer research. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  This bill is, it's not a massive bill. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=210.28s)]
*  It's minor things that would have been extended that are critical for working Americans to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=214.24s)]
*  live on, on a day to day basis. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  That's why Mike Johnson agreed to it because that's what Donald Trump promised. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=224.44s)]
*  He promised that he was going to lower costs and help working Americans. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=229.8s)]
*  And when push comes to shove and that's what the Republicans try to do, Donald Trump directs [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=234.5s)]
*  because Elon Musk is pulling the strings and the House Republicans jump because Donald [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=241.8s)]
*  Trump says jump and they kill the bipartisan deal. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=247.24s)]
*  And now I don't know what the way forward is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  They're going to need us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=253.4s)]
*  They're going to need the Democrats and they're not going to get us if they don't go back [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=254.4s)]
*  to the original deal or better. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=259.12s)]
*  Well that's an important point here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=261.32s)]
*  First of all, the Democrats still control the United States Senate until next year, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=263.2s)]
*  just to be clear. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=266.92s)]
*  So there's that part of it too. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=267.92s)]
*  But they're operating now under what's called suspension of the rules. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=269.8s)]
*  The only way they can get things to the floor and they have to bypass the rules committee [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=272.8s)]
*  is a two thirds vote, which means they need Democrats. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=275.16s)]
*  Just internally, like the game plan here seems to be this is routed through leader Jeffries. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  There were two defections of Democratic votes today. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  But generally my understanding is the way the Democratic caucus has dealt with this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=287.16s)]
*  and dealt with this chaos throughout is Jeffries negotiates for the caucus. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=290.52s)]
*  You don't cut separate deals. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=295.7s)]
*  That's how you have leverage. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  So you've got the plan here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=298.38s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=299.38s)]
*  And we've seen this through this whole conference, as Melanie just said, this whole Congress, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=300.38s)]
*  I should say. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=304.7s)]
*  Every single bill that was a must pass bill was required Democrats, usually more Democrats [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=305.78s)]
*  than Republicans in order to keep the government open, in order to raise the debt ceiling, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=313.34s)]
*  in order to provide supplemental security assistance to Israel and Ukraine and Taiwan. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=317.23999999999995s)]
*  So we all know, even James Comer has acknowledged that this bill is only going to pass with [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=323.32s)]
*  Democratic support. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=330.2s)]
*  So why would Democrats, under any circumstance, agree to anything less than the bipartisan [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=332.12s)]
*  deal that Mike Johnson has already agreed with? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=340.28s)]
*  So you are not going to get any more than a couple votes for anything less than that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=344.56s)]
*  And until Republicans realize that, we will just sit around Washington, D.C., we will [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=349.92s)]
*  unfortunately see Elon Musk shut down, harm a lot of Americans, while I'm sure he goes [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=355.06s)]
*  on his yacht somewhere, and we will wait until they come back to the table where we had an [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  agreement, we had an agreement, and all of this would have been avoided. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=368.44s)]
*  Well, yeah, there's that old Stalin quote, how many divisions has the pope? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  How many votes has Elon Musk? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=375.76s)]
*  He has zero votes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=378.64s)]
*  This is how many votes Elon Musk has. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=379.64s)]
*  Zero votes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=381.44s)]
*  So you guys decide. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=382.44s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman, thank you very much. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=383.44s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, the House Republicans seem to be listening to him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=384.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqZZ2nAQjE&t=387.44s)]
