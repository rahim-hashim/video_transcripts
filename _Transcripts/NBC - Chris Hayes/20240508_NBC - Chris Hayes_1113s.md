# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 7
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE)
*  Joining me now are two people who watched this all happen live at the courthouse. MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=0.0s)]
*  former Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice Harry Lemon. It's great to have you guys both here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=5.9s)]
*  Well, let's just start in the morning, which is we didn't know that Stephanie Clifford, Stormy Daniels was going to take the stand today, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=11.8s)]
*  We did not. I was standing in line waiting to get into the courtroom when the Associated Press [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=19.6s)]
*  reported this morning that Stormy Daniels would be the witness. And I have to tell you, I was really surprised for a couple of reasons. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  One, I was surprised that it hadn't gotten out before, but I was also surprised given where we were in the case. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=31.36s)]
*  We heard perhaps the driest day of testimony in the trial so far. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=37.68s)]
*  Yesterday, all about the false documents or the allegedly false business records that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=42.0s)]
*  constitute the heart of the crime that's been charged here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=47.96s)]
*  To then go from that and instead of moving forward with other witnesses who would testify about those false business records, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=51.72s)]
*  to go sort of backward in time, but also upward in interest to Stormy Daniels was, I think, a little bit of a surprise narratively for me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=58.68000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, we didn't know in the morning, but actually before the jury came in, the defense raised something about her testimony. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=67.72s)]
*  So we knew it was going to be she before the jury did. So we could watch them very, there was a definite [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=76.84s)]
*  free soul, you know, when it happened. Whoa. And you could really zone in on the jury and their keen interest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  This was a name they'd been waiting to hear. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Yes, and obviously the most famous other person, I think, involved in this encounter. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=93.4s)]
*  So, all right, so you've got direct examination. But before we get into it, let me hear from you, each of you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=97.56s)]
*  How you view the, what is important about if you're setting up this on direct, like what do you need if you're the prosecution out of this witness, Lisa? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you what the prosecution said, because it was largely what I anticipated that they would say, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=113.16s)]
*  which is you need Stormy Daniels in the case because you need her to elaborate on what she would have told the public [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=117.96s)]
*  had she in October of 2016 not signed any agreement at all, but instead come forward. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  You need the jury to believe that so that they can understand better what Trump's motivation was for entering into the conspiracy in the first place and authorizing Michael Cohen, according to the prosecutor, to enter into the hush money settlement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=131.56s)]
*  You need to see her. That's the other thing, right? She's legally tangential, but she's narratively at the heart. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  The jury is curious. She's the human figure that puts everything in motion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=153.48s)]
*  The jury will be dissatisfied if it doesn't get a glimpse of her and hear her story. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=159.48s)]
*  Now, when I saw that she was going to be on one of the challenges for a witness like this, the way that human beings work is that when we tell the same story over and over again, we don't tell it the same way every time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=164.44s)]
*  This is just how people are. It's how memory functions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=175.32s)]
*  One of the things that happens in other litigation or criminal trials is when you have someone you want them to do their deposition, then you don't want them talking a lot about it because then they're up there and you can say, well, you said this here and this here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=178.6s)]
*  You've got this person in her that she's talked about this quite a bit. We played her on Jimmy Kimmel. She's in a peacock. She wrote a book. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=190.76s)]
*  What was your expectation of what kind of witness she would be and how was she? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=200.68s)]
*  Well, so let's start with the premise that the problem you identified is a problem for virtually every witness across this trial. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  And it's something that the prosecutors talk to prospective jurors about during voir dire. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=213.8s)]
*  They basically said to them, people's memories fluctuate. The events at hand here happened a long time ago. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=217.4s)]
*  And you won't blame people if there are minor inconsistencies in their stories because you'll understand that's human nature. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  Right. And so they're prepared for that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=228.36s)]
*  But what makes Stormy Daniels even more different than that is that she's got a story here that's rooted in a sexual trauma. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=230.6s)]
*  Yes, she said today Trump never physically or verbally threatened her, but it's clear in her retelling of the story that it is a problematic sexual encounter from her perspective. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  And like many sexual trauma victims, for her, some of the details that are most memorable and vivid aren't necessarily the ones that are cognizable or even important or relevant for a court of law. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And so confining her story to what the court thinks is important and what the defense will tolerate her testifying to is an added challenge on top of those inconsistencies built from the fact that these events happened. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=259.56s)]
*  You know, the 2006 sexual encounter between them was 18 years ago. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=274.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's true as to the sexual act itself, because Murchon was very concerned that it could be prejudicial to Trump. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=278.04s)]
*  So there's some sort of guardrails here about what she can and can't say. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=285.32s)]
*  That's right. And she speaks quickly and the DA doesn't control her that much. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=289.24s)]
*  And Murchon, like I've never seen him all during the trial, is piqued and actually at one point makes his own objection and sustains it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=294.76s)]
*  He thinks they go too far. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=302.6s)]
*  But that's at this core narrative of the sex itself. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  More broadly, she tells a story, a sort of version of an American success story that's at once hardscrabble, but exotic, for lack of a better word. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=307.08s)]
*  She really comes, she humanizes herself to the jury, which they're going to need because all they know is that she's a adult film actress. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  And she tells something that's that to really kind of try to dimensionalize herself as an actual human being with hopes, dreams, a career, different things she's done. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=327.32s)]
*  Precisely. And yet it's an, you know, does the jury get next to it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=337.16s)]
*  Because it's also there's a sensational kind of exotic aspect to it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  That thing that you said, I think actually is really relevant too, in terms of this question about motivation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=346.44s)]
*  Because I was following along today and a number of people noted, and I think this actually comes up on cross, that it has a darker cast. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=351.32s)]
*  Her telling of the story is less sort of like buffoonishly like wah wah kind of and more like this is gross. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=358.92s)]
*  This is icky. And she's very clear. This is not sexual assault. This was consent in a legal sense. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  But in terms of her subjective experience of it, she's in a power position. It felt she kind of got badgered into it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=372.28s)]
*  There's an imbalance of power. And she testified to looking up at the ceiling at one point and thinking to herself, how did I bring the actual sexual? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=380.2s)]
*  How did I misread this situation? How did I get to here? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=389.0s)]
*  And I have to tell you, Chris, for me, where that called me back to is May of 2023, sitting in a federal courthouse, not that far away, thinking about an E.G. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=393.32s)]
*  Carol, who was a victim of a sexual assault, thinking to herself after bantering with Trump, thinking she was going to have a cocktail party story in that Bergdorf Goodman lingerie floor and walking out after the assault, shaken, thinking, what did I? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=402.24s)]
*  I screwed up. What did I do to let it go here? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=417.64s)]
*  So here was murky and she was sort of disassociated in the key event. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=421.8s)]
*  Here was my light bulb moment about the testimony today from afar was putting two and two together, which is to say it's the Access Hollywood tape is the biggest crisis the Trump campaign faces. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=427.8s)]
*  Many people calling for him to leave subsequent accusations on the record by actual women who say he sexually assaulted me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=438.20000000000005s)]
*  He drove me. This story told in the way she told it today is a seems like much more of a possible death blow than the version that I think had been maybe communicated before or how I understand it, which was like. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=445.0s)]
*  Work, yeah, but foolish hijinks and less predatory. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  And the reason that seemed to matter to me is because of the motive here, which is that this is about the campaign. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=467.12s)]
*  Right. And, you know, to put it even a finer point on it, when you're talking about literally the campaign on a day by day basis, Stormy Daniels signs the first iteration of this non disclosure agreement that is not paid for by the Trump people on the same day that the New York Times reports that these other women are coming out of the woodwork to say that they have been sexually assaulted by Trump. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=474.24s)]
*  This is all happening in succession of day by day by day, starting with October 7th and the Washington Post reporting the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=494.08s)]
*  November 10th is the day that the New York Times reports these other women and Stormy Daniels signs for the first time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  But she doesn't sign the real agreement, the one that gets funded until October 28th. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=506.92s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Trump campaign is fighting valiantly to get out from under the Access Hollywood tape and the weight of it, including all of these prominent Republicans who don't want to associate themselves with him anymore. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=512.2s)]
*  Had she told that story, that this would have been devastating. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=524.28s)]
*  What Hope Hicks called a crisis would have been catastrophe. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=529.36s)]
*  But, you know, until then, what we've had is all this sort of maneuvering hush money. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=533.04s)]
*  This was Trump, the grotesque. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=537.16s)]
*  This was Trump, the foul kind of monstrous figure. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=539.52s)]
*  That is what exactly what they were scared of in October of 2006. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  Hence also the move for the mistrial. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=547.64s)]
*  I want to talk about that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=549.16s)]
*  Since the start of this trial, Donald Trump has violated his gag order 10 times. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=551.44s)]
*  Just this week on Monday, Trump was fined another thousand dollars for doing a phone interview where he said the jury was picked so fast from a pool of 95 percent Democrats. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=556.32s)]
*  Now the judge gave him a stern warning saying, quote, it appears the thousand dollar fines are not serving as a deterrent, which, yes, obviously, Judge. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=566.32s)]
*  The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  You are the former president of the United States. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  Also true, possibly the next president as well. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=578.88s)]
*  But he warned Trump that his continued willful violations of this court's orders threaten the administration of justice, constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=582.36s)]
*  I cannot allow that to continue. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=591.24s)]
*  It appears the judge was right. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=594.32s)]
*  It is not serving as a deterrent because just early this morning, Trump posted this quote, I have just recently been told who the witnesses today apparently references Stormy Daniels. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=595.4s)]
*  This is unprecedented. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=603.88s)]
*  No time for lawyers to repair. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  No judge has ever run a trial in such a biased and partisan way. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=606.8s)]
*  I should tell you, the post was quickly deleted from his account. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=610.8s)]
*  Back with me at the table, MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin, former federal prosecutor Harry Lippman. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  I should say that post again on the line, not a direct violation, but it is about a witness which gets into territory. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  So I want to read this part. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=625.0s)]
*  Do I have this? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  Oops, do I have it? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=629.1199999999999s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=631.28s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=631.8s)]
*  This is the sidebar between Mershon and Todd Blanch at some point that happens. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=632.8s)]
*  And we all you guys don't hear this, right? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=640.6s)]
*  OK, so we're getting this later. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=640.96s)]
*  I understand your client is upset at this point, Judge Mershon, but he is cursing audibly and he is shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=642.84s)]
*  It is the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=653.04s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, I will talk to him. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=656.08s)]
*  The court. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=657.48s)]
*  So I'm speaking to you here at the bench because I don't want to embarrass him. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=658.16s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, I will talk to him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=660.76s)]
*  The court. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=662.16s)]
*  You need to speak to him. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=662.52s)]
*  I won't tolerate that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=663.36s)]
*  Mr. Blanch, I will talk to him. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=664.32s)]
*  That's pretty wild behavior from the defendant. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=666.76s)]
*  And yet I've seen this movie before, Chris. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=669.64s)]
*  This is my fourth Trump trial in 12 months. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=671.72s)]
*  And I've seen this before. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=674.08s)]
*  I saw it at the E.G. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=675.04s)]
*  and Carol trial. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=675.8s)]
*  I saw it at the civil fraud trial. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=676.64s)]
*  Remember, Trump did not attend the first of the E.G. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=678.32s)]
*  and Carol trials. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=680.36s)]
*  And I'll venture a guess that it went better for him for not having been there, not just because he didn't testify, but because he does stuff like this. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=681.2s)]
*  At the second E.G. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=688.12s)]
*  and Carol trial, he banged his hands on the table, looked at the jury. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=688.76s)]
*  When she was testifying, it said, never happened. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=692.24s)]
*  Audibly. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=695.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=696.04s)]
*  You just cannot. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=696.32s)]
*  I mean, just to be clear, take a step back. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=697.24s)]
*  Like absolutely prohibitive. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=699.04s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=701.6s)]
*  The judge called it what it is. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=702.36s)]
*  Contemptuous. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=703.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=704.76s)]
*  I mean, it's literally contemptuous. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=705.12s)]
*  And he's also said before that he would not find a violation of the gag order suesponte, meaning on his own without a motion. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=706.76s)]
*  Obviously what the client does in court is also not extra judicial, as he pointed out the other day. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=714.28s)]
*  But I think he is dead serious when he talks to Blanche, which is why you hear this repeated incantation of I will talk to him. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=720.28s)]
*  I will talk to him. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=726.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't think we saw any of that for the remainder of the day, but I think Trump is dancing on the head of a pin. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=728.04s)]
*  The problem is the DA's office also knows that and they know that Roshan is prepared to send Trump to jail for as little or as much time up to 30 days as possible. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=735.0s)]
*  And so if they come forward with another alleged violation, they know it has to be a serious one that is worthy of the punishment that Judge Roshan has stated he's willing to impose. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=745.36s)]
*  But the big detail, I think you'll light it is he deleted it after half an hour. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=756.28s)]
*  He's he's nervous. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=760.76s)]
*  No, right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=761.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=762.2s)]
*  No, we said that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=762.4s)]
*  But my point being that right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=762.96s)]
*  So there is something that's happening here. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=764.4s)]
*  Now, let me just ask the mistrial question and then I want to get your sense of sort of the day of Stormy Daniels and how she did because we haven't talked about cross yet. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=766.16s)]
*  So just quickly on the mistrial motion, he says as you know, he says as a threshold matter, Mr. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=773.48s)]
*  Blanchard, I agree. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=780.2s)]
*  Things were there were things that would have been better left unsaid. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=780.8s)]
*  You said he was quite pointed on that Harry, in fact, sustained his own objection. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  I think the witness was a little difficult to control, but ultimately I'm not going to give a mistrial. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=786.76s)]
*  Is that about what you would anticipate? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=790.64s)]
*  At most? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=793.48s)]
*  I mean, look, it really wasn't something that could prejudice the entire proceedings, etc. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=794.48s)]
*  But he was he had laid down these guardrails and that was exactly where they kept in the in the questioning. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=800.28s)]
*  But it was really Stormy herself who really did go outside the answers to quite a bit. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=807.48s)]
*  So I don't think he was really flirting with the mistrial. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=813.0s)]
*  But he wanted to. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  And he and he told the D.A. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=817.4s)]
*  to take her back and caution her, shorten her answers. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=820.12s)]
*  And she did. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=824.2s)]
*  I was thinking of Katherine Christian or frequent guest here who works in that office in the end in that court for 25 years. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=825.0s)]
*  Who's like people like to cross. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=830.08s)]
*  There's a lot of line crossing and it's sort of, you know, you're kind of getting as much it's like in the playoffs, the NBA, like you're going to sort of push until you get the whistle. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=831.84s)]
*  Right. Like that's kind of the intent. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=840.0400000000001s)]
*  So I want to get your sense. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=841.48s)]
*  The cross seemed to me not that effective as I read it, but I was not in the room. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=843.84s)]
*  Did you think it was effective, Lisa? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=847.9200000000001s)]
*  I thought there were moments in time where there were inconsistencies in her story and she appeared to tie herself a little bit up into knots. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  But on the whole, the tone that the defense took with her, which was combative from the start. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=857.6s)]
*  And this is Susan Necklace, who hasn't done a ton of witnesses in this trial. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=863.5600000000001s)]
*  She hasn't. And my suspicion is because she was saving herself for the two big ones today. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  And I expect that she'll be the one to cross examine Michael Cohen. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=872.96s)]
*  Susan Necklace was incredibly well prepared. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=876.6s)]
*  She knew that book that Stormy Daniels has written inside and out. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=878.9200000000001s)]
*  And yet it didn't quite pay off for her because she was combative with Stormy. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=883.2s)]
*  And the tone was nasty to a point that I think the jury will ultimately find empathy. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  Also, Stormy did get much more succinct in her answers and almost was more emboldened by getting to answer reading questions. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=896.72s)]
*  Right. The fact that she can say false and just stop right there. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=905.92s)]
*  There was a few like weird kind of Perry Mason moments. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=909.28s)]
*  I mean, really textbook mistakes. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=912.08s)]
*  I've got to say on Necklace, you want to cross to be crisp and have the witness answer every question. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=914.52s)]
*  Yes. Correct. Correct. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  And when you get to the point where you've implied you're lying, that's when you stop and go to the next topic. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=922.88s)]
*  She went for broke repeatedly. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=928.2s)]
*  Like you made it all up. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=930.72s)]
*  You made it happen to you. False. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=931.88s)]
*  And then she was stuck and there were repeated sidebars also. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=933.9200000000001s)]
*  So her rhythm rhythm is everything on cross and her rhythm was repeatedly broken. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=937.12s)]
*  It's so funny when you're in deposition and they're asking you these questions and you know you're saying yes, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  succinctly, because they're like, you're like, where's it going? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=946.08s)]
*  Where's it going? You know that like, yes, yes. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=947.88s)]
*  Oh, I know you've got an idea here. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=949.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. How do you what was your evaluation of her overall sort of credibility today in terms of what what this witness meant for the case? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=951.12s)]
*  I thought it was strong because substantially the core of the story was sympathetic and she substantiated everything. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=961.32s)]
*  But I found myself not certain. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=970.08s)]
*  I thought there were different members of the jury who reacted to her differently. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=972.6800000000001s)]
*  She was unusual kind of witness, much more colorful, much more vivid and dramatic. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=977.12s)]
*  So I thought overall fine, but I wouldn't be surprised if some among the jury were, you know, a little bit nonplussed. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=983.28s)]
*  And I don't know how to go back there. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  Remember, she's a witness. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=996.76s)]
*  Doesn't matter for the law. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=998.16s)]
*  She matters for the feeling of the case, the righteousness of the case. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=999.28s)]
*  Even if she were making it all up, it wouldn't matter for the charges. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1003.12s)]
*  And yet it would be devastating for the case. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1006.6s)]
*  We want them to like her. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1008.52s)]
*  And I think they largely did. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1010.96s)]
*  I wondered, though, how you felt. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1012.52s)]
*  I was I was uncertain. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1014.88s)]
*  I think Stormy Daniels, as Kerry said at the very beginning, is sort of a complicated person. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1017.84s)]
*  And she's a very conversational person who had her own objectives in being a witness. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1022.4399999999999s)]
*  Again, I go back to the fact that for her, this was a traumatic event. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1027.24s)]
*  She wanted to tell her truth and her lived experience and how it fits into this case are not one and the same. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1031.48s)]
*  And that posed problems for the prosecution in the sense that Susan Necklis is a I'm sorry, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1039.52s)]
*  Susan Hoffinger, who took her direct examination, is an extremely experienced prosecutor. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  She's not a person that would just lead a witness casually or erroneously. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1049.7199999999998s)]
*  And yet there were times where I felt like she was boxed and she didn't have any choice [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1054.32s)]
*  but to ask leading questions to prevent Stormy Daniels from going on and on about things [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1057.9199999999998s)]
*  that Mershon had already warned were irrelevant or prejudicial or both. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1063.4799999999998s)]
*  It's really, really, really interesting stuff. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1068.28s)]
*  What she said. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1070.7199999999998s)]
*  We're going to come back on Thursday and we'll see. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1071.32s)]
*  I mean, they'll probably be redirect, we imagine. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1075.2399999999998s)]
*  And wow, what a day. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1077.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, that was honestly, I cannot thank you both enough. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1080.2399999999998s)]
*  That was fantastic. You guys are putting incredible work. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1082.6s)]
*  It's great. I feel like I don't even need to be there. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1085.36s)]
*  I got I got exactly what I need. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1089.04s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, Harry Lippman. Thank you both. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJL20caDBSE&t=1090.9199999999998s)]
