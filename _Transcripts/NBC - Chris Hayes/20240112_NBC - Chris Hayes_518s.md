# Ava DuVernay on her new film ‘Origin’ and the ‘intellectual Indiana Jones’ at its center
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE)
*  In 1994, writer Isabel Wilkerson became the first black woman to be awarded the Pulitzer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=0.0s)]
*  Prize in journalism for a feature article she wrote in the New York Times on a 10-year-old [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=5.12s)]
*  black boy on Chicago's South Side and her coverage of the 1993 Midwestern floods. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=8.52s)]
*  Nearly 20 years later, in 2010, she wrote The Warmth of Other Suns, an instant classic, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=13.8s)]
*  won a whole bunch of awards. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  It's about the black migration north through much of the 20th century, an incredible book. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=21.0s)]
*  Can't recommend it highly enough. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=25.16s)]
*  She followed that up with Caste, The Origins are a Discontents, an epic exploration of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=27.32s)]
*  the nature of not just American racial hierarchy, but hierarchy across the world over spans [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=32.36s)]
*  of time and place. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=37.76s)]
*  And I was lucky enough to talk to her about her hopes for the book on my podcast, Why [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=38.76s)]
*  Does This Happen? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=42.48s)]
*  This actually is not an argument. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=45.28s)]
*  This is an invitation to look at ourselves differently, an invitation to understanding [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=49.16s)]
*  what we might not have seen or known about ourselves before. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  In fact, could not have known because these things are not taught, the connections have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=59.04s)]
*  not been made, and this is an attempt to make connections that otherwise we would not see. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  So that's how I look at it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=68.36s)]
*  And it's filled with stories to allow a person to be able to see for oneself what I'm presenting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=69.84s)]
*  And then an amazing turn of events, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Ava DuVernay got the rights to the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=79.44s)]
*  book, Caste, and then rather than make a documentary or a series like her 13th for [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=84.72s)]
*  Netflix about the 13th Amendment, she's produced an original feature film titled Origin that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=89.72s)]
*  sort of tracks the story of Wilkerson writing the book interlaced with its themes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=94.6s)]
*  Slavery lasted 246 years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=100.72s)]
*  That's 13 generations of people plus another hundred years of Jim Crow segregation, violence, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=104.12s)]
*  and murder. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=111.92s)]
*  It is, of course, horrific. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=112.92s)]
*  I am not downplaying any of it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=114.12s)]
*  There were so many millions of African-Americans who were murdered from the Middle Passage [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=116.08s)]
*  until the end of legal segregation that it goes beyond the realm of an official number. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  There is no number. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=136.08s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=137.96s)]
*  Stunning. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=139.96s)]
*  The film is already getting Oscar buzz and rave reviews from everyone from Oprah Winfrey [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=142.0s)]
*  to Lin-Manuel Miranda. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=145.72s)]
*  It is set for wide release next week, January 19th, and Ava DuVernay, the writer, director, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=146.72s)]
*  and producer of the film joins me now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=152.0s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=153.4s)]
*  Happy to be here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=154.4s)]
*  What a phenomenal film that I got to watch today that's, I would say, almost unlike any [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=155.4s)]
*  other thing I've seen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=159.88s)]
*  I want to start with, occasionally I will hear news in Hollywood that so-and-so is making [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=160.88s)]
*  a film out of this thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  And there's two that I thought of. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=168.4s)]
*  The big short, when Adam McKay was going to be in the big show, I was like, how are you [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=170.12s)]
*  going to make that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=172.32s)]
*  And Barbie, I was like, how are you going to make that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=173.32s)]
*  And Cass, which I had read, I was like, how are you going to make that into a movie? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=174.96s)]
*  How did you conceptualize it? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=178.12s)]
*  Well, that's the beautiful thing about film and about creativity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=179.56s)]
*  We can figure it out when everyone says, how do you do it? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=182.0s)]
*  And on this one, this is an anthropological thesis, truly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=184.24s)]
*  This is a call to action in many ways, but it's facts, it's figures, it's some anecdotes [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=188.76s)]
*  that have a few characters here and there, but not a story in the sense of I can adapt [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=193.4s)]
*  a beginning, middle, and end. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=197.36s)]
*  So I was hunting for the way in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=200.44s)]
*  I knew I didn't want to make a documentary. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=202.32s)]
*  Documentaries are what I use to convey information. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=204.32s)]
*  I wanted people to feel emotion and empathy, and so the best way to do that is with actors. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  So I started searching for characters in the book. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=211.44s)]
*  I thought maybe I'll make it like Crash, that film, interlocking stories. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=213.52s)]
*  I was trying to think of all the ways to do it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=217.12s)]
*  And then Isabel started to rise from the pages, because occasionally she'll use first person [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=219.84s)]
*  to describe her research and what she's doing to put these pieces together. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=224.28s)]
*  So I started to look in the places where she said, I did this, my journey here, and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=228.1s)]
*  started to think, wow, what have she guided us through? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=232.22s)]
*  And what I love about it is that the story ends up becoming her putting the pieces together [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=234.46s)]
*  in some ways. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=237.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=238.9s)]
*  It was sort of emerging from a wreckage of a whole bunch of personal tragedies she went [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=239.9s)]
*  through, and then it kind of interweaves. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=242.66s)]
*  So you sort of transport from Nazi Germany to India, to her vision of it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=244.9s)]
*  The other question I had was how you got the film made, because again, you're like, oh, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=252.18s)]
*  I have cast, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=256.1s)]
*  It's not the hot studio pitch. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  It's not the hot studio pitch. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=259.22s)]
*  It's not like, it's not transferring. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=260.22s)]
*  No, it's no cape. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=262.22s)]
*  No one's in a cape. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=263.22s)]
*  There's no superhero. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=264.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=265.22s)]
*  But there is a superhero. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=266.22s)]
*  She is sort of a superhero. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=267.22s)]
*  She is a superhero. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=268.22s)]
*  Anjanu Ellis-Taylor, who is the outstanding lead in this film. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=269.22s)]
*  She does a remarkable job. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=271.98s)]
*  She's incredible. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=272.98s)]
*  She said that she felt like an intellectual Indiana Jones. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=273.98s)]
*  Yeah, it has that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=276.82000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=277.82000000000005s)]
*  It's like a caper. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=278.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, a bit of it, because we're globe-shotting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=279.82000000000005s)]
*  We shot this film in 37 days on three continents. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=281.66s)]
*  And so we're moving around the world, moving around time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=286.1s)]
*  And that is not a real viable pitch for studios. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=289.1s)]
*  I want to make a film about cast. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=293.82000000000005s)]
*  And so we just bypassed that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  We didn't do a whole bunch of studio pitches. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=298.74s)]
*  We just started to think of who were like-minded individuals, organizations that were interested [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=300.86s)]
*  in this kind of fare. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  And we came up with a few places, like the Ford Foundation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=307.66s)]
*  Yeah, the Ford Foundation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=312.94s)]
*  And Melinda Gates and Lorene Powell Jobs and like-minded folks that are interested in this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=314.26s)]
*  It's awesome because it looks and has a feel, the aesthetics of a big film. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=322.54s)]
*  It's a big film made by philanthropists. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=323.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=326.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=327.54s)]
*  You know, the thing that I, the sort of unlocking moment in that book, which I read and I had [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=328.54s)]
*  Wilkerson, is this sort of notion of we tend to think in narrower terms about racial hierarchy [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=333.14s)]
*  in the US and the experience of slavery, for obvious reasons. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=337.54s)]
*  But the experience of hierarchy according to cast is a much broader and global phenomenon [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=340.44s)]
*  through times and space and different history. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=345.4s)]
*  What do you want people, that to me was the kind of like key juxtaposition I walked away. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=348.26s)]
*  How do you think about this hitting your audience? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=352.58s)]
*  I just think, you know, the knowledge of the interlocking kind of connective tissue between [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=355.16s)]
*  oppressions, subjugations, you know, environments where folks are degraded and demeaned. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=360.76s)]
*  The reason why there's so much pain around those issues is because you feel isolated. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=369.38s)]
*  You know, I know African Americans feel like no one understands, you know, you know, Dalit [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  people feel like they're in a very unique position. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  Jewish people as it relates to the Holocaust feel, you know, very isolated from what I've [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  heard in terms of folks really understanding the pain. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=387.44s)]
*  All of our pains are so specific and yet there's a universality to it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=391.58000000000004s)]
*  If you understand that there's something underneath connecting it, it makes you feel a bit like [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=395.66s)]
*  a bit less alone. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=399.34s)]
*  That's how I felt when I read the book, that I'm connected to these people through this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=400.34s)]
*  social phenomena. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  And it provided a bit of, I don't know, it had a liberating quality. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=406.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the things that struck me about the book, and this comes up in the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  movie as well, is the idea that like when you are presented with another society's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=416.9s)]
*  caste system, it seems ludicrous on its face. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=422.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=425.78s)]
*  Because like, oh, those are, we call them untouchable. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=426.78s)]
*  And you're like, why? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=429.05999999999995s)]
*  When you're in your own version of it, like you're so acculturated to it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  And so the sort of transport across these different boundaries allows you to kind of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=436.38s)]
*  like step outside your own society. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=440.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and it's an empathy machine, but also I mean, shocking. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=442.61999999999995s)]
*  I had no clue, and I'm an African American studies major, have a degree in African American [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=444.9s)]
*  studies. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=449.9s)]
*  I've never heard about the fact that, you know, that American segregation and miscegenation [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=451.9s)]
*  laws were the blueprint for Nazi protocols. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=456.73999999999995s)]
*  That's not something that is widely taught. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=461.06s)]
*  I remember reading that in the book and having my mind blown. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  And so we explore that moment in the film where she puts those pieces together. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=465.5s)]
*  We explore, you know, how the Trayvon Martin case was really the catalyst for her to start [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=469.9s)]
*  thinking about, wait, everyone's calling this race. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=475.29999999999995s)]
*  But there's something else going on here. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=478.29999999999995s)]
*  It's a Latino man who stalks and kills a black boy to protect an all-white neighborhood. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=480.82s)]
*  Does that feel neatly in the box of race? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=486.09999999999997s)]
*  There's something else. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=488.54s)]
*  So in just being with her and watching her investigate, explore, and kind of peel back [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=489.78s)]
*  the layers of the mystery, you learn along the way. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nwkFtpNrE&t=494.54s)]
