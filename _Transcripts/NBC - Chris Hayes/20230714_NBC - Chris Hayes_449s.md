# ‘Charmless is putting it nicely’ Why big GOP donors are souring on DeSantis
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc)
*  A number of Republican candidates who are not under criminal indictment gathered in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=0.0s)]
*  Iowa today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=4.64s)]
*  A half-dozen were at the Far-Right Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines to be interviewed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=5.64s)]
*  on stage by a disgraced former cable news host. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=9.96s)]
*  It is an important event in the state with the first-nominating contest of the GOP primaries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=13.52s)]
*  It's a particularly crucial moment for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who faces a widening [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=18.56s)]
*  gap with frontrunner Donald Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=22.78s)]
*  A loss of support within the Murdoch media empire, which could be crucial, and growing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=24.72s)]
*  concerns among big donors who are reportedly starting to look elsewhere. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=29.02s)]
*  DeSantis is now begging those donors to stay put. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=33.22s)]
*  In a confidential memo first obtained by NBC News, the campaign says not to worry about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=35.98s)]
*  its frequent missteps and sagging poll numbers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=40.18s)]
*  Why would donors ever worry about that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=42.9s)]
*  Brendan Buck served as the senior adviser to House speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  He also worked for Ryan as the vice presidential nominee in 2012, and he joins me now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=48.58s)]
*  I think of you as a creature of the part of the GOP that would have both the staff level [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=54.26s)]
*  and the donor level been looking for an alternative to Trump and maybe look favorably on DeSantis [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  coming out of that Florida election. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=69.58s)]
*  What do you think the issue is here? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  Maybe everyone's just jumping the gun too early? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=73.72s)]
*  What's your assessment of where things stand? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  We may be jumping the gun a little too early, but I think there's two problems. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=79.3s)]
*  One is of strategy, and I think kind of getting to the point you were making. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=82.38s)]
*  One, Ron DeSantis seems to believe that there's a lane there for him among Trump voters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  I think what Ron DeSantis needs to appreciate is all of the people who are not voting for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=93.42s)]
*  Donald Trump are looking for somebody else. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  They're ready to turn the page, and yet he is running a very Trump-like campaign. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  He wants to appeal to Trump voters. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=106.14s)]
*  I think you have to look at people like me who are ready to turn the page, who are rooting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=108.17999999999999s)]
*  for someone to be someone unlike Donald Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=112.06s)]
*  So I don't quite understand where he thinks this big pool of votes is going to come from. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=115.42s)]
*  There's a big pool of votes who say they don't want to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=120.14s)]
*  We've seen that, and I really think it's his own fault that there are 13 candidates now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  He waited so long, and he was so unimpressive when he first came out that he had all of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=127.7s)]
*  these people rush in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=132.46s)]
*  But I think that gets to the second point. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=134.22s)]
*  One is I'm just not so sure he's very good at this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=135.86s)]
*  I think there is a lack of charm that exists. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  And we've heard this a lot, and I was around him a bit in the House of Representatives. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=142.34s)]
*  Charmless is putting it nicely with this person, and it shows up when he's meeting with donors. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=146.54s)]
*  It shows up when he's out on the campaign trail. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, at some point, you have to make people feel something. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  And for whatever you think about Donald Trump, he makes you feel something. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  But Ron DeSantis is a bit dull, and so it makes people very easy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  It's not very hard for people to look at him and say, I'm not sure this is it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=166.22s)]
*  And they start looking at others, and that's what a lot of people are doing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this reading from the NBC News reporting, across the DeSantis political universe, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=173.5s)]
*  there's a heightened awareness of the importance of the early states. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  The reality, he will burn out without strong performances there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=180.9s)]
*  From my understanding, if we don't see a bump in the polls, we're basically going to shut [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=184.18s)]
*  down the idea of a national operation, a DeSantis-aligned operative said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=187.38s)]
*  I've, of course, seen this before, although, again, this is so early, and I've also seen [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=190.62s)]
*  a million ups and downs, so I'm not writing any obituaries here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=194.58s)]
*  But on your first point, this does strike me as the biggest thing, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  It's going to be Trump and someone else. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=200.78s)]
*  Like, in the end, Trump's not going to go away. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=204.06s)]
*  So it's going to be Trump and someone who is not Donald Trump at some point in this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  primary, or Trump's going to walk with it if it's split. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  And he really doesn't seem to want... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=215.18s)]
*  He hasn't figured out how to occupy that without being the anti-Trump, which I understand, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  if you're running a Republican primary, is difficult, but you can be the alternative. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=222.78s)]
*  And that has not been the foot forward that they have put rhetorically. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=226.38s)]
*  So he puts out this four-page memo, and there are two sentences about how he might take [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=231.34s)]
*  on Donald Trump. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=235.12s)]
*  I mean, that's your biggest problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=236.12s)]
*  Like, they're name-checking Doug Burgum in this memo, and they're talking about Tim Scott [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=237.62s)]
*  and punching down without a whole lot of focus on the person who is swamping them in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=242.02s)]
*  polling. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  At some point, you have to realize your path is not being like Donald Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  Those people are voting for him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=253.54s)]
*  You need to figure out how to take this person on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=254.92s)]
*  There are a few things in there that they're talking about doing, and that's fine. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=256.9s)]
*  But it seems like a complete lack of awareness of what the real dynamic is here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=261.34s)]
*  And people are going to start walking away from him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=265.14s)]
*  I think a lot of the polling for Ron DeSantis was people hoping that he's the best person, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=267.86s)]
*  that they've been told that he's the best alternative. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=274.26s)]
*  And they think that this is—look, I will take Ron DeSantis 100 times out of 100 over [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=276.22s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people like that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  But I think it is largely his own fault that now he has to talk about Tim Scott instead [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=283.82000000000005s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=287.86s)]
*  If he had made this a one-on-one race from the very beginning, his memo talks about how [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=288.86s)]
*  they want to move on from questions about Donald Trump in contrast with Joe Biden. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's nice, but that's not actually how you're going to win this race. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=296.70000000000005s)]
*  You have to take on the person who's beating you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=300.14000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  That's not the race you're running. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=304.14000000000004s)]
*  You have to win the other one first. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  You're not all doing that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=307.06s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=308.06s)]
*  He's not the only one doing that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=309.06s)]
*  But there's an opportunity there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=310.06s)]
*  Chris Christie gets on TV every time he talks about this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  Getting attention is probably the hardest thing for a lot of these people. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=316.3s)]
*  So I don't think Chris Christie is very viable in terms of his unfavorables. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=319.58s)]
*  But there is an audience, there is a conversation that is going to be had at some point between [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=323.9s)]
*  somebody and Donald Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=328.3s)]
*  And if Ron DeSantis wants to be the alternative, he needs to welcome that conversation and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=330.06s)]
*  start it pretty soon. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=334.8s)]
*  Yeah. And again, this is not I would this is not I would not have anyone I would not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=337.56s)]
*  hire myself out to give advice on Republican primary politics. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't necessarily have any keen comparative advantage there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=346.36s)]
*  But but it does strike me that when you look at the polling, right, like Trump is at 50 [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=350.4s)]
*  percent, he's a 55. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=355.56s)]
*  Like there there you've got to think about how do we build out the 45? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=356.56s)]
*  You know, I mean, he's at 53 July 12th, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=362.36s)]
*  So that's 47 that are not there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=364.76s)]
*  Like that's your if you're if you're picking the fruit off the tree, that's the low hanging [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=366.88s)]
*  fruit. How do I get that first 47 when I get that, then I could worry about how do I eat [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=370.94s)]
*  into this guy's support. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=376.84s)]
*  But if you if you build up your strength, that's the thing that's going to bring people over, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=379.24s)]
*  I think, ultimately. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=383.64s)]
*  You've got to think about that first, I think. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=384.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. But like I said, there's still a lot of opportunities. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=388.88s)]
*  And there's going to be a debate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=391.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's not going to be there and maybe he'll have a great performance and show that he [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=392.44s)]
*  is the alternate. He is the person. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  Yep. He has a lot of money. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=397.23999999999995s)]
*  There are a lot of people who are rooting for him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=398.52s)]
*  So, I mean, I don't think we can we can write him off quite yet, but absolutely. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=400.0s)]
*  He needs to consolidate that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=403.28s)]
*  Again, I think it's his fault that there's a lot of people looking around right now, but he [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxh_5dvWYLc&t=404.28s)]
