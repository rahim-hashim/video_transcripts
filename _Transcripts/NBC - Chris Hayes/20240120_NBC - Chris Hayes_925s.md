# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Jan. 19
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. We are four days from the New Hampshire primary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=0.0s)]
*  and what is shaping up to be a make or break moment for both the Republican Party and the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=4.08s)]
*  nation. A bit over a year ago, take yourself back right after the 2022 midterms, there [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=8.24s)]
*  was this dawning awareness among both the professional Republican political class and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=13.4s)]
*  Republican Party primary voters that Donald Trump was pretty politically toxic. And a bunch [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=18.32s)]
*  of credible Republican candidates announced presidential campaigns and it really looked [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=24.46s)]
*  like it could be a competitive primary. It doesn't look so competitive anymore. The ex [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=28.88s)]
*  president just beat all of his opponents combined in the Iowa caucus. He's pulling double digits [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=35.64s)]
*  ahead of his closest competitor, Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. If Trump does end up winning [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=40.48s)]
*  decisively in the Granite state, it is difficult to see how there could be even the semblance [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  of a competitive race going forward. Of course, as we always say here, the future remains [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=50.44s)]
*  unwritten. Nikki Haley has held some momentum in the last few weeks, remains possible. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=55.52s)]
*  She pulls out a surprise victory. New Hampshire has surprised us before. If she doesn't though, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=60.56s)]
*  Donald Trump will likely be the Republican nominee. 14 months after Trump led Republicans [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=66.44s)]
*  to that catastrophic midterm election, he's once again consolidated the base and the Republican [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=71.92s)]
*  Party behind him. Now, perhaps the most obvious factor that led us to this point is that Trump [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=76.44s)]
*  has successfully convinced Republican primary voters that all the various lawsuits and prosecutions [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=81.48s)]
*  he faces are political witch hunts. But that part's easy. Those people are primed to believe [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  that anyway, right? That's the low hanging fruit. The bigger factor is that nine years [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=92.64s)]
*  into his political career, the ex president has never actually faced real consequences [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=98.06s)]
*  for anything. Even as he is currently awaiting judgment in his civil fraud trial, the so-called [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=103.0s)]
*  corporate death sentence for the Trump work. The New York attorney general is demanding [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  $370 million in fines and a lifetime ban on the ex president participating in the state's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=112.96s)]
*  real estate industry. Today, we just got new video of a deposition recorded last year as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=119.56s)]
*  part of that case where he railed against prosecutors and banks, seemed to openly regret [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=124.08s)]
*  the meager extent to which he nominally separated himself from his businesses while in office. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=128.68s)]
*  I thought it would be appropriate to put it in a trust. I didn't want there to be a conflict, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=133.68s)]
*  although there could have been. I tell the story that George Washington actually, when [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=143.6s)]
*  he was president, had two desks, one for his business. He was actually a very wealthy man, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=147.4s)]
*  one for his business and one for running the country. I could have had that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=152.36s)]
*  We should note, of course, that he didn't really divide them up much. I mean, he grifted [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=156.52s)]
*  millions of dollars towards his private businesses while in the White House. He set up his hotel [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=160.2s)]
*  as a kind of bribery palace down the block. To be clear, that civil fraud trial with the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  corporate death penalty looming over him is not the only civil trial he is facing in New [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  York. Earlier this week, he attended his second defamation trial for writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=175.16s)]
*  Carroll says Trump sexually assaulted her in a dressing room back in the 1990s. During [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  a lengthy trial with Evidence Presented, a jury determined that she was telling the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=187.92s)]
*  truth and found Trump liable for sexual abuse. After his day in court this week, Trump went [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=192.2s)]
*  outside and effectively turned it into a campaign event, complete with American flags. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=198.27999999999997s)]
*  This goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway, these are circumstances that no other [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=204.76s)]
*  political candidate could possibly survive. Just imagine some other Republican or Democratic [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  possible nominee emerging from the sex abuse defamation trial. And because of that, I want [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=215.68s)]
*  to be clear here, it is not totally irrational for there to be this pervasive sense among [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  the electorate, Republicans, and others that he's going to wriggle out of this jam too. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=226.24s)]
*  But there's one consistent data point that shows things might really be different this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=232.16s)]
*  time. Poll after poll after poll shows that voters might actually abandon Trump if he [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=236.0s)]
*  gets convicted of a crime. An example, Reuters Ipsos poll earlier this month found that nearly [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=243.16s)]
*  two thirds of all voters, including a majority of independents and nearly a third of Republicans, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=249.36s)]
*  would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a felony. A New York Times Sienna poll [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=255.32s)]
*  from last month found the same percentage of Republicans, 28%, that say Trump should [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=260.0s)]
*  not be their party's nominee if he gets convicted, even if he wins the most votes in the primary. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=264.74s)]
*  An NBC News entrance polling from the Iowa caucus earlier this week, a sample of the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=270.72s)]
*  most engaged Republican primary voters, found that about a third of them, right, consistent [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  numbers here, a third of them also say a conviction would make Trump unfit for office. Now to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=280.24s)]
*  be clear, I'm not naive. This is a future hypothetical post to these folks. And a bunch [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  of those people are going to talk themselves into voting for him anyway, trust me. But [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  some of them won't. And elections are determined in the margins. Donald Trump understands that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=295.76s)]
*  full well. I mean, his one goal is now winning the presidency to stay out of prison. I mean, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  clearly. And he knows a conviction makes that much, much harder. So now he is monomaniacally [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=307.64s)]
*  focused on this issue of presidential immunity, not just at the practical level, but as the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=312.56s)]
*  express justification for his entire campaign. He made it explicit last night after Sean [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  Hannity in typical fashion teed him up a softball question on his closing message for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=323.28s)]
*  voters in New Hampshire. What is your closing message to the people of New Hampshire? It's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=327.84s)]
*  very simple. It's make America great again. But I think very important before we do this, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=334.28s)]
*  because you were talking about the Supreme Court, they have two votes that are very important [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  coming up. One is, as we discussed, we call it Colorado or whatever. But, you know, I [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  really believe they're going to leave the people to vote again. You're the leading candidate [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  in both parties. You're leading the Democrats by many, many points. I mean, it's hard to imagine [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=352.08s)]
*  they would do. And most states have already approved it. As you know, very few states have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  done that. This is Colorado and a couple of others at this moment. But they have another [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=361.32s)]
*  important and that's immunity for the president. The president of the United States, and I'm not [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=365.84s)]
*  talking about myself. I'm talking about any president has to have immunity. Because if you [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=370.32s)]
*  take immunity away from the president, so important, you will have you have a president [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  that's not going to be able to do anything. Because when he leaves office, the opposing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=379.32s)]
*  party president, if it's the opposing party, will indict the president for doing something [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=383.48s)]
*  that should have been good. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=388.68s)]
*  Just to be clear, right, if it's like the closing case, can it hand? He's like, what do you want [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=390.4s)]
*  to tell the voters in New Hampshire about their lives and their futures and why they should [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=393.64s)]
*  vote for you if they're grinding away and Biden's economy? What's the message? And he's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=396.96s)]
*  like presidential immunity. Absolutely. Gotta have presidential immunity. It remains the case [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  that no major party in my lifetime has ever from a purely political perspective taken on such a [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=407.88s)]
*  reckless endeavor as to nominate a man who is likely to face trial and get convicted smack dab [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  in the middle of the election year while he is the nominee. It feels weird to bring this up [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=420.44s)]
*  because I'm like, am I what am I missing here? This is a fact that seemingly only one Republican [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=426.52s)]
*  was willing to acknowledge out loud the guy who dropped out last week. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=433.72s)]
*  Are you convinced that he will be convicted of something in all of this? He's going to be [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=439.52s)]
*  convicted this spring in Washington on the January 6th stuff. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm not a candidate, so we'll see if if and when that changes. And I see, yeah, that's probably [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=451.12s)]
*  a lot of sugar, huh? And people acquired skills in spite of slavery, not because of it. And then [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=456.92s)]
*  they use those when they when they achieve their freedom within 10 minutes of me being in the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=462.8s)]
*  city. I see some guy relieving himself on the sidewalk with number two. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=467.44s)]
*  Do you remember Ron DeSantis that name ring a bell? If Republican primary voters do, the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=475.36s)]
*  memories are not particularly fond ones. He is currently pulling in a whopping 6% of primary [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=480.0s)]
*  voters in New Hampshire polls, numbers so low he skipped the state and went straight to South [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=485.12s)]
*  Carolina, where he is a much more robust 7%. It has gotten so bad that after his second place [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=489.28s)]
*  finished in Iowa, the top DeSantis super PAC named somewhat ironically, never back down, laid off [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=495.35999999999996s)]
*  much of its staff in some big states. Hard to believe now, but there was a time this was the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=501.2s)]
*  far right Florida governor's race to lose. A year ago, he was even beating Donald Trump head to head [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  by double digits in the polls, a huge lead to go with a huge campaign chest, $150 million raised by [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=511.76s)]
*  last summer. The problem was that the more people heard Ron DeSantis and saw Ron DeSantis, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=517.84s)]
*  interacted Ron DeSantis, the less they liked him. And even Nikki Haley won't debate him now. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=523.76s)]
*  He ran a truly terrible campaign. He squandered those millions. But I have to point out that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  worse than that, there is, I think, plausibly an actual death toll associated with the DeSantis [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  campaign for president. One of his key plans in this race was to be Trumpier than Donald Trump. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  And a big part of that strategy was running to Trump's right on the COVID pandemic measures, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=546.72s)]
*  which included trashing the vaccines, the Trump vaccines, and he is still doing it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  They lied to us about the COVID shots. Remember, they said if you take a COVID shot, you will not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=558.64s)]
*  get COVID. How true was that? Not at all. Now, every booster you take, you're more likely to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  get COVID as a result of it. No, that's not true. That is not true. That's false. Dangerously false. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=570.64s)]
*  But that's who DeSantis is. He also yelled at kids for wearing masks in a pandemic, and he [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=579.12s)]
*  hired a state surgeon general who spread complete, like, totally nutty lies that the MRA vaccine [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=584.4s)]
*  would infiltrate your DNA. And it all had a tangible effect on the health of residents [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=591.04s)]
*  in America's third biggest state. Look at this chart. It shows the very first COVID wave that hit [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=596.4s)]
*  after the vaccine became available and after DeSantis started bashing the vaccines. As Florida [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=600.72s)]
*  vaccination rates flagged, its death rate and Delta wave topped out at nearly three times the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=606.56s)]
*  rest of America. 87,000 Floridians have died of COVID on DeSantis' watch, according to New York [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=611.12s)]
*  Times. For what? Six percent of New Hampshire Republican votes? It's easy to laugh at DeSantis [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=616.48s)]
*  and his terrible presidential campaign, but it cost more than $150 million and his dignity, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=622.48s)]
*  and it also cost actual lives. Joining me now is David Jelle, former Republican congressman of Florida [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  who served alongside Ron DeSantis in the House. Every once in a while, I'm reminded the guy's still [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  governor of the third largest state, presumably with a day job he should be attending to, and the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=636.64s)]
*  surgeon general is still the surgeon general saying just utterly, like, recklessly dangerous, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=641.84s)]
*  insidious, nutty stuff about the COVID vaccines. Yeah, Chris, perhaps the best part of Ron [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=648.48s)]
*  DeSantis' year on the campaign trail is it kept him out of the state of Florida, and he did less [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=654.4s)]
*  harm here. As you identified, Ron DeSantis, a uniquely unlikable politician, and I think the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=658.88s)]
*  words of the book of Proverbs have rarely been more prescient than pride go with before a fall, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=665.12s)]
*  because this is a governor whose first ad said that on the eighth day, God created Ron DeSantis, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=670.32s)]
*  and now he's simply in this race running to be the last one to drop out. And so how did we get [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=676.32s)]
*  there? Look, he had a 19-point win in his reelection in the state of Florida, a historic [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=681.44s)]
*  win. He did it, as you mentioned, based on the politics of COVID, on culture wars, and on a [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=687.2800000000001s)]
*  weakened Florida Democratic Party, and none of those key elements of his reelection were actually [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  translatable to a presidential campaign. And he also had the vanity that came with being a very [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=698.08s)]
*  powerful governor, the most powerful we've seen in a couple decades. Mix in with that the raw [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=704.24s)]
*  ambition of his partner on the trail, his spouse, and you see a candidate who thought he was going [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=709.36s)]
*  to step in this race and replace Donald Trump, but he miscalculated that. He thought that the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=714.4s)]
*  party would get past Donald Trump. He thought the Department of Justice would sink Donald Trump, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=719.6s)]
*  or he thought he could engage in a relegate slog, and none of those strategies have worked. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=724.4s)]
*  And so now it is kind of a political death watch. I don't know that he leaves after New Hampshire. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=729.76s)]
*  I wonder if both Haley and DeSantis drop out on the night of South Carolina, but either way, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  he's on his way out. One of the reasons I want to talk to you tonight is because you've known [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=741.28s)]
*  DeSantis for a while. Obviously, you were active. You were a Republican congressman in Florida. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=744.8s)]
*  You've been active in politics. In the state, you know him. And you very early on, in fact, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=749.52s)]
*  we did a live show down in Miami. You were like, this guy is not very likable and not very good [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=757.04s)]
*  campaigning, and I don't think this is going to sell. And you said it very early on. And I do [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=763.52s)]
*  wonder how much there were strategic miscalculations, which they were, or just ultimately, this guy just [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  doesn't have the appeal to do it. Yeah, look, some people are uniquely bad at retail politics. He is. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=773.36s)]
*  We know that. Maybe he has other strengths. But it's that raw combination of arrogance and anger, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=780.0s)]
*  and it's both are very powerful, right? I mean, if you consider his culture wars, within his culture [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=786.72s)]
*  wars is his personal ethos that he knows best how you should raise your kids and what your family [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=792.0s)]
*  should believe. His attacks on the migrant community is an attack on diversity. His attack on voting [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=797.68s)]
*  rights is an attack on empowering communities of color to exercise their franchise and participate [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=802.72s)]
*  in democracy. His attack on education in the LGBT community is an attack on the independence of [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=808.0s)]
*  parenting that my wife and I would like to be in charge of for our children. And so if he took [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=813.36s)]
*  culture wars too far, I think it's in that vein. I think he chose culture wars because it was a way [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=818.72s)]
*  to run adjacent to Donald Trump in a space that Trump didn't own, but it didn't work. And it [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=824.5600000000001s)]
*  backfired on him. And I think it's good for the country that it did. Yeah. I mean, I think, again, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=829.44s)]
*  it's very easy for candidates to confuse preference with intensity in politics, which is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=834.4s)]
*  you run a poll and they say, look, Republican Party voters agree with you on health care for [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=840.88s)]
*  trans youth. And they do. Republican Party voters do agree with Ron DeSantis on that. I think they're [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=845.92s)]
*  wrong. But also if that's what you're obsessed with, you come off like a weirdo, even to Republican [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=851.12s)]
*  primary voters. And I mean, honestly, like this stuff, I think that the obsessiveness and the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=856.16s)]
*  narrowness of that focus really did end up costing them. Yeah, Chris, look, the trans issue is a [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=864.0s)]
*  relatively new one for our culture. And you can see the good faith actors trying to achieve equity [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=871.84s)]
*  and you see the bad faith actors attacking it. And I suppose if there's a silver lining in the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=877.2s)]
*  politics of Ron DeSantis' race for the White House, it's exactly what you point out, that there's a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=882.08s)]
*  limitation on attacking the trans community. It can't take you to the White House. And that's a [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=886.96s)]
*  good. Well, my first instinct on him as a national candidate was that I may be an out of touch New [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=891.04s)]
*  York City liberal, but I know my country and the man is too short to be president. I think that's [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=895.92s)]
*  proven to be true. David Jolly, thank you very much. It's true. It's true. What are you going to say? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcURIgAPKG0&t=899.76s)]
