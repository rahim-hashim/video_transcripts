# Reporter who exposed welfare scandal involving Brett Favre, fmr. Mississippi governor now risks jail
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk)
*  You remember that story from a couple of years ago where the former NFL quarterback Brett [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=0.0s)]
*  Favre was caught up in a state of Mississippi welfare fraud scandal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=5.44s)]
*  It involved state officials diverting funds meant for poor, mostly black women and children, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=9.88s)]
*  according to public records. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=15.36s)]
*  The series ran in this small nonprofit outlet called Mississippi Today, and we featured [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=16.88s)]
*  it on our show quite a bit. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=21.28s)]
*  We spoke with Anna Wolff, the reporter who broke the story back in September of 2022. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=22.36s)]
*  She was just a remarkably impressive piece of investigative journalism that went on to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=28.04s)]
*  win a Pulitzer last year. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=31.48s)]
*  But since then, as NBC News correspondent Ken Delaney explains, the reporter has been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=33.64s)]
*  embroiled in a lawsuit that might land her in jail. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=38.44s)]
*  This is the kind of corruption that Mississippians know all too well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=44.04s)]
*  Anna Wolff's reporting at Mississippi Today exposed a huge scandal in the poorest state [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  in America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=53.36s)]
*  $77 million in welfare funds intended for children in need went instead to multiple [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=54.44s)]
*  pet projects, including this horse ranch, this volleyball arena, and to sports celebrities [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=60.32s)]
*  like Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=65.56s)]
*  Favre was never charged, but the reporting led to eight criminal indictments and journalism's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=68.44s)]
*  biggest prize. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=72.84s)]
*  Adam Ganachow is the editor of the paper. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=74.36s)]
*  You can't just win a Pulitzer unless there's real impact. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=76.68s)]
*  Two days after the Pulitzer announcement, we got the first threat of legal action. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=79.2s)]
*  Former Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, who was in office when the fraud occurred, is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=85.08s)]
*  suing the newspaper, Wolff, and other staffers for defamation, saying Mississippi Today wrongly [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=89.36s)]
*  accused him of a crime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=95.04s)]
*  Allegations in court documents suggest Bryant was among those who directed the spending, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  but he maintains he did nothing illegal. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=101.2s)]
*  I did nothing wrong. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=103.28s)]
*  I wasn't aware of the wrongdoings of others. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=104.84s)]
*  How would you explain to somebody who's never heard about this, Phil Bryant's overall role [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=107.86s)]
*  in the welfare scandal? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=111.94s)]
*  So it's pretty well laid out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=113.92s)]
*  It doesn't say that he did anything illegal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=115.94s)]
*  This is an agency under the governor's office. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=119.14s)]
*  I mean, he has control, he has oversight. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=120.98s)]
*  Bryant did not initially sue over the newspaper's prize-winning reporting. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=124.42s)]
*  Instead, he brought the case over how the reporting was later described, including [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=127.82s)]
*  when the newspaper's CEO said Bryant embezzled funds, which is not true. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=132.04s)]
*  He was never charged, and there's no indication he's under criminal investigation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=136.98s)]
*  Bryant's attorney Billy Quinn says that was the last straw. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  So here we are to give, one of their favorite words, accountability to the situation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=145.04s)]
*  Well, the rabbit's got the gun now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=151.34s)]
*  We'll see who's going to be accountable. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=154.26s)]
*  The rabbit's got the gun now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=157.34s)]
*  Think about that phrase. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=159.32s)]
*  Because the former governor of Mississippi is a public figure suing for defamation, he [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=161.26s)]
*  must show there was actual malice, basically a reckless disregard for the truth. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=165.7s)]
*  And so he's asking for the paper's internal emails and the names of confidential sources. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  That is something journalists simply do not divulge. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=175.22s)]
*  If Wolf and her editor do not turn over their files, they face possible prison time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=178.04s)]
*  Are you willing to go to jail? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=183.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=185.82s)]
*  It's real. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=186.82s)]
*  It's scary, but something I think we feel very strongly about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=187.82s)]
*  Free press is essential to the workings of a free society. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=193.74s)]
*  And what Anna Wolf and her editors are facing right now is really scary stuff. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxjWh4EuNsk&t=196.34s)]
