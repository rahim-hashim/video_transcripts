# ‘To hell with this place’ George Santos kicked out of Congress
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY)
*  The United States Constitution makes it very hard to expel a sitting member of Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  disorderly behavior, and with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=8.52s)]
*  Two-thirds majority is an extraordinarily high bar to reach. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=13.52s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=16.22s)]
*  I mean, in most cases, it's the voters that should be the ones to decide who stays or [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=17.22s)]
*  goes in Congress. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=20.6s)]
*  So in order for someone to actually get expelled, they really got to do something particularly [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  egregious. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  The last example was Ohio Democratic Congressman James Trafikant, who was expelled in 2002 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=27.44s)]
*  after getting convicted on corruption charges. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=33.88s)]
*  He did not go quietly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=37.2s)]
*  I'll go to jail, but I'll be damned if I'll be pressured by a government that pressured [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=39.92s)]
*  these witnesses to death to get a conviction on a target, the number one target in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=48.72s)]
*  Today, Congressman George Santos did not go quietly either. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=57.28s)]
*  The indicted New York Republican was finally expelled from the House by a truly overwhelming [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=60.32s)]
*  margin, nearly three to one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=64.84s)]
*  That's less than a full year after he was sworn into office. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=66.64s)]
*  As a New York Times notes, this is, quote, the first time since the Civil War that a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=69.8s)]
*  member has been removed without a criminal conviction. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=74.4s)]
*  For his part, Santos told reporters, quote, why would I want to stay here? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=78.72s)]
*  To hell with this place. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=82.62s)]
*  And thus ends one of the truly strangest chapters in the 234 year history of the U.S. House [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=84.26s)]
*  of Representatives. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  I'm joined now by someone who is there to witness it up close and someone who's documented [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  this story for history. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=94.18s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman is a Democrat of New York who is at the forefront of the effort [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=95.9s)]
*  to expel Santos. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  Mark Ciasano, who started covering Santos in 2019 as a columnist and editorial writer [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  at the Long Island newspaper Newsday and has authored the brand new book, The Fabulist, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=104.86000000000001s)]
*  the lying, hustling, grifting, sealing and very American legend of George Santos, which [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=109.18s)]
*  is out now. Good to have you here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=112.9s)]
*  Congressman Goldman, it was, I think, a little this is the third third attempt. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=113.9s)]
*  Expulsion votes are rare. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=118.62s)]
*  Successful expulsion votes even rare. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=120.14s)]
*  So special successful expulsion votes not pursuant to a conviction. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=121.98s)]
*  Unprecedented. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=126.26s)]
*  Your reaction to today's news. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=128.22s)]
*  Well, I think we're getting a little over out of our skis by talking about how unprecedented [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=132.02s)]
*  this is, that there was no criminal conviction. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=136.86s)]
*  It's also unprecedented. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=139.94000000000003s)]
*  Effectively, I'm not positive, but unheard of that the Ethics Committee would release [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=141.94000000000003s)]
*  a report prior to the resolution of a criminal case. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  Ordinarily, the Ethics Committee refers to the Department of Justice. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=150.74s)]
*  So the House of Representatives is not obligated to operate under rules of a criminal court. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=154.74s)]
*  We have our own rules based on the Constitution, based on the rules that have been set forth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=162.78000000000003s)]
*  George Santos was provided with due process through the Ethics Committee. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=169.14s)]
*  He declined to participate, he declined to be interviewed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  And then they did an investigation and released a report that was incredibly damning, worse [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=176.94s)]
*  than I think even I could have imagined. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  And I filed the original complaint to the Ethics Committee for them to do this investigation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=184.06s)]
*  So at some point, it becomes just a simple question of whether or not George Santos [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=190.1s)]
*  violated the rules of the House and deserves to continue to be a member of Congress, one of the 435 [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  most powerful people who make our laws. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't much more complicated than that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  And this idea of precedent and innocent, but not innocent until proven guilty, it's all bunk. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=209.22s)]
*  That exists in a courtroom where your liberty is at stake. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  That is not the congressional standard. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  That is not anything that anyone needs to work with. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=222.98s)]
*  I am perfectly comfortable as a member of Congress to say that the precedent that either [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=225.62s)]
*  there's an Ethics Committee report or a criminal conviction is enough, remove someone, fine. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  If you meet either of those standards, okay. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=238.18s)]
*  Yeah, just to be clear, I don't think unprecedented necessarily means bad. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=241.3s)]
*  I mean, to me, what's interesting here is that I think he was unprecedented. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=246.18s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing you pointed out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=250.66s)]
*  I think what Santos pulled off was unprecedented. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=253.22s)]
*  He basically, effectively and comprehensively defrauded the voters of his district to get [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=256.26s)]
*  himself elected. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=263.54s)]
*  And then it was revealed probably was defrauding to a criminal extent, although it's just alleged [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=264.98s)]
*  at this point, a whole bunch of people throughout his entire life. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=270.1s)]
*  I don't think there's any precedent for him, a guy like that, getting elected to Congress. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=273.06s)]
*  I mean, the first conversation I had with him, I write about this in the book. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=276.18s)]
*  This is kind of the very first time, 2019, and I call him and I've written about sketchy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=279.38s)]
*  politicians before, but this is Long Island. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=283.62s)]
*  But I give him a call and he says, I'm launching my campaign today, but I'm in Florida right [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=286.34s)]
*  now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=292.5s)]
*  And this is the New York district, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=292.74s)]
*  Why are you launching your campaign in Florida where he is on business? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=294.1s)]
*  And he also, by the way, didn't have his campaign finance filings up yet. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=297.3s)]
*  You know, everything was there right at the beginning. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=300.42s)]
*  How weird this guy was. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=302.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=303.94s)]
*  And I wonder too, Congressman Goldman, let me ask you this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=304.5s)]
*  This was, there was an interesting thing happened among the New York delegation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=308.9s)]
*  The New York delegation was, I think, understandably took this quite personally, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  that they were serving next to this individual. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think across the bipartisan lines wanted to get rid of him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=319.62s)]
*  There's also some degree to which it seemed like the Republican members in those frontline [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=322.41999999999996s)]
*  districts who are going to have to face the voters in districts that are, you know, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=326.34s)]
*  were plus Biden districts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=330.26s)]
*  It's useful for them to be like, we're not like this guy, George Santos. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=332.18s)]
*  Don't throw him in with him. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=336.74s)]
*  What do you think about that aspect? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=338.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, let's focus on Elise Stefanik right now, who was George Santos' [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=341.38s)]
*  biggest backer, biggest supporter, and voted to protect him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  She's the conference chair of the Republican Party and also a New York member. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=349.22s)]
*  The other freshmen members in much more vulnerable districts did an interesting bait and switch. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=354.1s)]
*  In May, when we first brought the expulsion motion up, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=361.38s)]
*  they were the ones who moved to table it, which meant move just to kick it down the road [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=364.98s)]
*  and protect George Santos. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=369.14000000000004s)]
*  Then about a month ago, before the ethics report had come out, nothing had materially [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=371.22s)]
*  had changed from May. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  All of a sudden, they realized that politically, George Santos was a liability for them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=379.78000000000003s)]
*  So then they initiated an expulsion motion so they could say they were trying to remove him. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=386.74s)]
*  That failed. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=392.26s)]
*  Many members wanted to wait for the ethics committee report. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=393.62s)]
*  So this was just purely political from the New York Republicans who wanted to distance [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=397.14000000000004s)]
*  themselves from George Santos when they realized that he, rightly so, is such a political liability [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=403.3s)]
*  for them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=409.14000000000004s)]
*  But in reality, more than half of the Republican Party voted to protect George Santos, not [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=409.78000000000003s)]
* withstanding the egregious misconduct that was laid out in that report. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=415.14000000000004s)]
*  Here's my question for you, Mark, who was sort of there from the beginning, which is [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  like when you take a step back, the big question that I had in the beginning is still there, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=423.38s)]
*  which is like, how did so many systems fail for this guy? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  I think we now can all say this guy never should have been a member of Congress. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=431.7s)]
*  That has been the judgment of three quarters of the House. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=435.06s)]
*  I think it's the judgment of the people in this district. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  How did it happen? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  Why did it happen? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=440.5s)]
*  Well, so one of the things that I kind of looked into in the book is the scientific [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=441.38s)]
*  literature behind lying, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=445.29999999999995s)]
*  It actually is very difficult to figure out if someone's lying. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=447.06s)]
*  One way you do that is to almost like make someone tell the story backwards. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=449.7s)]
*  And I think that's like a way to look at how hard it is to find people out who are lying [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=453.38s)]
*  about everything. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQOy1iO6KY&t=458.18s)]
