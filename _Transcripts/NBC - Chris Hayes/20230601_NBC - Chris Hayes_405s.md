# Grassley: GOP ‘not interested’ in whether Biden accusations are ‘accurate’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw)
*  The response on the right to their leading candidate being indicted and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=0.0s)]
*  simultaneously criminally investigated on the federal and state level has been to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=3.04s)]
*  throw everything they have into investigating anyone with the last name Biden. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=6.72s)]
*  The Oversight Committee, chaired by Republican Congressman James Comer, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=11.84s)]
*  spent roughly the last five months launching investigation after investigation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=15.32s)]
*  When they finally released their first report last month, here is the New York [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=20.2s)]
*  Times headline about it. Quote, House Republican report finds no evidence of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=24.76s)]
*  wrongdoing by President Biden. Not the headline they're going for. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=28.76s)]
*  But Republicans have soldiered on trying to find any evidence of anything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=32.28s)]
*  And now they are threatening to hold FBI Director Chris Wray in contempt of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  Congress for not blindly handing over a confidential document that includes [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=40.08s)]
*  unsubstantiated claims from a so-called informant about Biden and his family. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=45.88s)]
*  Republicans can't even find this star informant. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  No, seriously, they are saying the informant himself, the person made the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  accusations is missing. So instead, they want the FBI to publicly release [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  whatever unsubstantiated claims are in that document. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  People have actually read the document, like Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=65.52s)]
*  readily admit that Republicans really just don't care if these wild claims are [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=69.0s)]
*  true or not. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  We aren't interested in whether or not the accusations against Vice President [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Biden are accurate or not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  Senator, how damning is this document to the sitting U.S. president? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=84.44s)]
*  Well, it's I don't know that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=89.44s)]
*  And that's what we need. You've read it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  I read it. Let's put it this way. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=95.84s)]
*  There's accusations in it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=97.84s)]
*  Even over Fox News, they are quite frustrated that Republicans have not been [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=102.28s)]
*  able to show the receipts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=105.96s)]
*  It really is disheartening to see all of the oversight that you all are trying to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=107.52s)]
*  do, whether it's IRS, whether it's FBI, DOJ, and just having very little luck, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=113.0s)]
*  frankly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  But the most telling comment came from the oversight chairman himself. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  He went on Fox News shortly after 4 a.m. last week and was asked if his [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  investigation has moved the needle in the upcoming presidential election. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=127.88s)]
*  You look at the polling and right now, Donald Trump is the only person who [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=131.88s)]
*  knows that Donald Trump is seven points ahead of Joe Biden and trending upward. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=137.2s)]
*  Joe Biden's trending downward. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=141.04s)]
*  And I believe that the media is looking around scratching their head and they're [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=143.04s)]
*  realizing that the American people are keeping up with our investigation and they [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=146.64s)]
*  realize something's wrong here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Republicans, including the head of their investigation, are in that clip, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=152.6s)]
*  nakedly admitting what is obvious to everyone, which is this is just like Benghazi [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=155.8s)]
*  before it is a blatant political attempt to bring down Biden's numbers, even to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=159.68s)]
*  the obvious frustration of the people most invested in. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=164.68s)]
*  Jackie El-Nani has been reporting on the investigation for The Washington Post, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=168.56s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Jackie, I want to I kept thinking I was missing something here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=174.32s)]
*  So I was like seeing reports about it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=178.12s)]
*  And then I went back and sort of read in there is some document somewhere in the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=180.08s)]
*  FBI where some person said the president, Vice President Joe Biden, six or seven [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  years ago, was taking bribes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=190.24s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=191.72s)]
*  That's exactly right, Chris. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=193.72s)]
*  There are a lot of different rabbit holes to go down when it comes to trying to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=195.72s)]
*  piece through all of House GOP Republicans, different allegations of whistleblowers [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=199.6s)]
*  because lawmakers like James Comer and Jim Jordan have pinned the success of their [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=204.36s)]
*  investigations to in order to paint the Biden administration and his family as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=208.88s)]
*  corrupt and the federal federal government as a political tool on these allegations, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=215.12s)]
*  whether or not they're credible. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=220.6s)]
*  But this allegation in particular on this showdown with Christopher Wray, which only [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=222.08s)]
*  really lends Comer more credibility than he has substantiated or verified, is over [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=227.72s)]
*  this FD 1023 form. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=234.56s)]
*  And this is an informant that has given unverified, unsubstantiated allegations to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=237.72s)]
*  the FBI that Comer and Chuck Grassley have been demanding that Christopher Wray [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=245.0s)]
*  turn over even though they've already reviewed this document. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=251.64s)]
*  Right. I mean, so the idea is that like somewhere in the government, there's some [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=254.92s)]
*  informant who at some point told the FBI like the vice president is taking bribes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=258.36s)]
*  Now, I don't know, maybe the vice president was taking bribes and like no one knew [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=263.08s)]
*  about it and the whole thing was covered up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=266.64s)]
*  Or maybe this informant didn't know what he's talking about. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=268.44s)]
*  You could choose. But this is this is what the FBI said. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=271.64s)]
*  You an FD 1023 form is used by FBI FBI agents to record unverified reporting by a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=275.04s)]
*  confidential human source. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=281.88s)]
*  Documenting the information does not validate it, establish its credibility or weigh it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=283.4s)]
*  against other information verified by the FBI. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=287.84s)]
*  I mean, between that statement and the way Chuck Grassley responded, I'm not getting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=290.52s)]
*  the vibe from anyone involved in this document that they're giving it much credibility. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=295.8s)]
*  It's just a useful narrative device for the investigation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=300.08s)]
*  Exactly. This is the these are the exact headlines that James Comer wants, especially as [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=305.24s)]
*  he sort of simultaneously struggled to actually present any substantive evidence that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=311.12s)]
*  directly ties Joe Biden to some of the evidence that they have been able to scrounge up [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=315.52s)]
*  that have at least raised questions about the Biden family's business dealings. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=321.2s)]
*  But Christopher Ray did offer directly an extraordinary accommodation to Grassley and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=325.84s)]
*  James Comer this week in a phone call. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=332.72s)]
*  He said that they could come in in person and review a redacted version of the document. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  They just couldn't take it home with them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=340.0s)]
*  Comer has said that this is insufficient, that they need the production of the document so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=342.16s)]
*  they can continue to analyze it more thoroughly. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=345.92s)]
*  Of course, there's myriad reasons why the FBI has said that they can't actually produce [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  this document. But either way, James Comer is able to at least muddy the waters by all [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=354.68s)]
*  of us having this conversation about these unverified. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=361.0s)]
*  Yes, it's perfect. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=364.2s)]
*  It's just again, the MacGuffin is a Hitchcock term for a plot device of some sort of, you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  know, hidden thing that you're looking for. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=370.64s)]
*  The suitcase in Pulp Fiction being a great example. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  This is Comer's MacGuffin. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=375.0s)]
*  At some point, we'll find out whether it's true or not. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=376.56s)]
*  I think I know which way I would bet if forced to. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=378.64s)]
*  Jackie Alamani, thank you very much. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=381.76s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJ1uYqaklw&t=383.96000000000004s)]
