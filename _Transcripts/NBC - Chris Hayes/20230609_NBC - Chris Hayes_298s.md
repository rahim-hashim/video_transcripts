# Eric Holder: Jack Smith won’t be ‘deterred by anything Donald Trump throws at him'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE)
*  by Eric Holder, who is the former attorney general of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a great pleasure to have you on, sir. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=3.36s)]
*  We had booked you this evening to talk about the incredible surprise of the Supreme Court, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=5.84s)]
*  which upheld a big part of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act throughout congressional [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  redistricting by the state of Alabama, something you've been very invested in. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=14.64s)]
*  But you are also the former attorney general of the United States. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=19.44s)]
*  I can't imagine anyone who would have more insight into what is going on inside that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  building inside the minds of Jack Smith and Merrick Garland on a night like tonight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=28.6s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting. I think that finding out what's going on now would be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=34.52s)]
*  interesting, but I think probably more interesting is what happened in the days and weeks [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=38.56s)]
*  that have preceded this evening. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=43.32s)]
*  There has clearly been a determination made that there is a basis to bring charges [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  against a former president of the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=52.0s)]
*  And I think people need to pause. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=55.64s)]
*  You know, this is Donald Trump and he's different and he's, you know, not like anyone else. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=57.68s)]
*  But for the first time in the history of this country, a former president of the United [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=63.24s)]
*  States has been indicted on federal charges. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=66.88s)]
*  But something I also want to make clear, we should not in any way denigrate or devalue [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=70.08s)]
*  what happened in Manhattan. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  That was a serious charge. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=76.88s)]
*  That is a serious charge and was consequential as well. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=78.88s)]
*  I think ultimately, they're going to be they're likely to be four indictments, including [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=83.04s)]
*  the two that we now know about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=87.44s)]
*  I think they're probably two additional ones. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=88.72s)]
*  And this is something that for me was expected, but is nevertheless in a whole bunch of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=92.0s)]
*  ways really kind of breathtaking. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=98.44s)]
*  You know, all the media reports, in fact, were more accurate. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=100.88s)]
*  I've known Jack Smith for a good number of years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=105.4s)]
*  He's a serious, sober minded prosecutor who is not going to be deterred by anything that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=108.32s)]
*  Donald Trump throws at him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Merrick Garland, I've known probably 25, 30 years, he's equally not going to be perturbed, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=116.52s)]
*  disturbed or moved by that which Donald Trump throws at him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=122.28s)]
*  Mr. Trump is now in in waters that are uncharted for him. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  There may be attempts at delays. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=133.28s)]
*  But the federal court system handles those kinds of attempts. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=136.08s)]
*  And this is a matter that will ultimately be put before a jury unless he decides he wants [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=142.88s)]
*  to try to cut some kind of a deal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's it's interesting you say that because, again, he is he is legally presumed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  innocent under our system of justice in the courtroom, although American citizens are [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=160.24s)]
*  allowed to form opinions on public matters in whatever way they choose. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=164.88s)]
*  My general sense, the way this usually goes down, I remember former Clinton adviser, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=169.44s)]
*  Sandy Berger, quite famously had gone to an archive. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  He had walked out with some documents which he had sort of stuck in his clothing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  He didn't take that to trial. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=183.84s)]
*  If I recall correctly, he pleaded that out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=185.12s)]
*  And my sort of strong suspicion is the way the Department of Justice operates, the facts [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=187.64s)]
*  as as reported so far, is that were this just a lieutenant in the Air Force or someone [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=192.92s)]
*  who worked in the government who was a contractor, there would probably be a strong impetus [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  to to to try to cut a deal and to and to to plea. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=205.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I suspect so. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  Given the strength of the case, as I know it, I suspect that would be a real attempt [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  on the part of the defense to try to cut a deal such that you would minimize the amount of time [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=218.48s)]
*  that the defendant would serve in jail, the amount of money that he might have to pay. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=224.24s)]
*  You would try to minimize the punishment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=228.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is a different kind of a different kind of bird. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=232.24s)]
*  He will undoubtedly try to portray this as the deep state getting after him. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=236.32s)]
*  He will somehow try to tie it to Democrats attempt to deny him the nomination and ultimately [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=241.56s)]
*  the presidency once again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=249.44s)]
*  But I think people have you know, I'm not a political pundit, but I think people have [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  underestimated how the American people are going to view this indictment and then others [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=256.8s)]
*  that are to follow, including the one in Manhattan that has already been returned. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=263.8s)]
*  Yeah. How are they going to view the totality of these charges against Mr. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=268.12s)]
*  Trump and the impact that it's going to have on his political fortunes? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOftAG57sYE&t=273.64s)]
