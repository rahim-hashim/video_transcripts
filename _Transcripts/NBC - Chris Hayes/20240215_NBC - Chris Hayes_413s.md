# ‘Amazing turn of events’: Raskin reacts to arrest of GOP's Hunter Biden ‘informant’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg)
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. He is actually the ranking member on the House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=0.0s)]
*  Oversight Committee, which has been investigating these claims. In a statement tonight, he said, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=4.0s)]
*  quote, I formally call on Speaker Johnson, Chairman Comer and House Republicans to stop [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=8.88s)]
*  promoting this nonsense and end their doomed impeachment inquiry. Congressman Raskin joins [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=14.0s)]
*  me now. Is this the end of the road for this line of investigation, Congressman? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=20.64s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope so. The members of the committee on the Democratic side have seen these [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=26.88s)]
*  fraudulent allegations debunked time and time again. Lev Parnas wrote a letter to Chairman Comer to me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=36.96s)]
*  He was Rudy Giuliani's right-hand man. He said, I was sent out there to concoct this case. There's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=44.16s)]
*  nothing to it. We've seen the testimony of Devin Archer completely debunking it. The former [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=50.4s)]
*  president of Ukraine, Poroshenko, debunked it. The Republicans on the Senate side in 2020 did [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=56.72s)]
*  their own investigation and said they couldn't find anything to it. So we're not that surprised [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=64.72s)]
*  that this has happened, but it is an amazing turn of events. And I do think it's an opportunity [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=71.12s)]
*  for a reset on the Republican side. We could use the oversight powers of Congress to be looking [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=75.92s)]
*  at the problem of gun violence, for example, or we could be looking at climate change, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=82.4s)]
*  or if they want to stick with this issue, let's look at the question of presidents and their [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=87.28s)]
*  families selling out the government of the United States. We did a minority report of our own. We [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=92.4s)]
*  released it over a month ago now. Chris, I think I came on to talk about it. We found in documented [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=97.6s)]
*  receipts nearly $8 million that Donald Trump collected at his hotels and golf courses from [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=104.0s)]
*  China, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, lots of countries. We could really look at the whole [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=110.24s)]
*  question of foreign government emoluments in a bipartisan way. And we could even look at the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=115.92s)]
*  question of other family members using their names in order to make deals with foreign governments. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  Fine. Let's look at that too, but let's be serious about it and let's deal with the facts rigorously [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=125.12s)]
*  rather than in mythological ways. One of the things that I think is key to highlight here, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=130.08s)]
*  and I just want to lay it out and you tell me if I have this right, is that it's always been the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=135.12s)]
*  case that Hunter Biden's work for Burisma was documented. We know that happened. We know the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=139.44s)]
*  payments were made to him, et cetera. And Hunter Biden had a business consulting with various [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  entities. The thing they've never been able to demonstrate, and I think because it didn't happen, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  is connecting it to Joe Biden, to the President of the United States, to the man who's actually [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=156.0s)]
*  the sitting president who they want to impeach. The reason they lean so heavily on this now, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=159.84s)]
*  it appears, fabricated allegation is because the only thing out there anywhere that made that leap, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=164.32s)]
*  in fact, several Sean Hannity monologues talk at length about this, right? This is the one, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=171.04s)]
*  this is the thing that connects it to Joe Biden. That's why this is so important. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=176.0s)]
*  Well, Jim Jordan said it is the key allegation in the whole constellation of allegations. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=180.8s)]
*  Chairman Comer was on TV yesterday talking about it. They clearly view it as the heart of the whole [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=189.44s)]
*  investigation. Already they're starting to backpedal and say, oh, it wasn't really about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=195.68s)]
*  Burisma in Ukraine. Well, then what was it about? Nobody can determine what it was about. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=200.8s)]
*  Mike Johnson, in endorsing the impeachment inquiry, went right to the Burisma allegation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=206.48s)]
*  So this really is the heart of it. I think it's an opportunity for them to say, you know what, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=212.16s)]
*  we gave it our best shot, but we're going to give up the ghost. There's nothing there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=216.24s)]
*  Even Donald Trump's handpicked special counsel, Mr. Weiss, has now brought charges against this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  confidential human informant who turns out, presumably, allegedly to have been engaged in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  a fraud from the very beginning. And that's what we have said, because there's simply no [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=232.0s)]
*  other evidence that's ever supported it. So on the question of impeachment, which is, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=236.16s)]
*  it was always the case. I mean, Donald Trump is very, very public. He wants Joe Biden to be [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=242.08s)]
*  impeached. I think if he were to face criminal trial this year, which I think is likely, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=245.68s)]
*  they would like to impeach Joe Biden around that time to essentially have kind of counter [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=251.36s)]
*  programming. That's my supposition. Now, they need a full vote of the House to do that. They [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=255.28s)]
*  just impeached Alejandro Mayorkas over what was clearly a policy dispute with no even allegation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=260.0s)]
*  of a high crime or misdemeanor. But it took them two tries. They failed on the first vote. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=264.8s)]
*  They succeeded by one vote the second time. Subsequent to that, a new Democrat has been [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=268.72s)]
*  elected in the third congressional district in New York. Their majority is now 219 to 213. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=273.2s)]
*  It means they can only lose two votes on anything if it's a party line vote. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=277.92s)]
*  It seems to me like it's dead. But I mean, maybe I'm getting out of hell with myself, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=285.52s)]
*  but I don't think they're going to be able to impeach the president, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=289.36s)]
*  not just because they have nothing, but now they also don't have the votes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=291.68s)]
*  Well, that's right. And, you know, they, when you say that Mayorkas was impeached over a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=296.72s)]
*  policy dispute, the policy dispute was they did not want Mayorkas working with the Senate, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=303.92s)]
*  Republicans, Democrats to actually solve problems at the border. That was the dispute. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=309.2s)]
*  They wanted to keep the border crisis alive for Donald Trump's candidacy. But look, they were [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=314.48s)]
*  never going to be able to impeach Joe Biden because you've got 15 or so so-called Biden [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Republicans who represent districts that went for Joe Biden, even though they're represented [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=327.44s)]
*  by Republicans. And those guys don't want to go anywhere near the fantasy production of this [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=333.04s)]
*  fake impeachment drive. And so it was never going to happen. The impeachment of Mayorkas was just [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=340.64s)]
*  this little trinket of a consolation prize that they got instead. And that also blew up in their [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  face. And so, you know, one might hope that they would say to themselves, let's give up all of the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=352.64s)]
*  nonsense, the impeachments and expulsions and censures and all of that. Let's get back to work [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=358.4s)]
*  and try to make something happen. But unfortunately, Donald Trump, the fourth branch of government [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=364.16s)]
*  vetoes it every time. Or the fifth branch of government, Vladimir Putin vetoes it. So they [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=369.12s)]
*  can't help the people in Ukraine. Putin doesn't want it. They can't solve the problem at the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=373.92s)]
*  border with Democrats because Trump doesn't want it. Well, and Mike Johnson right now doesn't have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=378.56s)]
*  the votes to bring anything to the floor or control the House whatsoever. It's a complete [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=382.0s)]
*  failed state in the House of Representatives right now. Congressman Jamie Raskin, thank you very much. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=387.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgktGYC1PKg&t=399.12s)]
