# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 17
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo)
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=0.0s)]
*  He served on the January 6th committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=2.5s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=4.2s)]
*  How much insight do you and your caucus have into what is happening now? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Because we were having a conversation today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=14.88s)]
*  I mean, we were really out past precedent here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=16.48s)]
*  It hasn't really happened. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=18.92s)]
*  No one really knows what happens next. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=20.14s)]
*  We were having a conversation today about trying to game this out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=21.48s)]
*  It's just kind of hard to say. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  What's your understanding? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=26.16s)]
*  Well, on the House floor on the Democratic side, there were discussions today at the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  macro level and the micro level. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=32.56s)]
*  And at the macro level, we are seeing this in the context of a series of attacks by the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=34.4s)]
*  mega rule or ruin faction on the constitutional order. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=41.56s)]
*  And it began on January 6th with a violent insurrection and an attempted political coup [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  to overthrow President Biden's victory in the Electoral College. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=50.88s)]
*  Then we went to the Republicans trying to sabotage any investigation into what happened [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=56.76s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=62.98s)]
*  We know that Kevin McCarthy pulled the plug even on their own plan for an outside bipartisan [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=65.08s)]
*  commission. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=70.12s)]
*  Then we went from there to an attempt to default on the debts of the United States. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=71.12s)]
*  Then we went from there to an attempt to shut down the government of the United States. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=75.52s)]
*  And now they're trying to install one of the critical pro-insurrection, pro-political [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=79.2s)]
*  coup actors in the House, if not the key one, as the speaker of the House. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=85.64s)]
*  So it's a remarkable moment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, in terms of the daily back and forth and the inside Machiavellian moves, we get [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  it secondhand, of course. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=98.48s)]
*  We're not there in the Republican conference. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=99.68s)]
*  But I will tell you that many of us were told on the way in today that at most the GOP defectors [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  amounted to around 10 or a dozen, and they got 20 votes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=108.96s)]
*  And I think that they were planning on going to the second or third ballot today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  And obviously, the pro-Jordan forces needed at least a day or a night to try and regroup [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  to go after the large numbers of unexpected votes against him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=123.36s)]
*  Yeah, I should note that the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, got more votes than [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=129.96s)]
*  Jim Jordan did today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, were it first passed the post-election, he would be the speaker. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not the way it works in the U.S. Constitution. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=141.6s)]
*  You need an outright majority of those seated. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  Here's what Hakeem Jeffries said about bipartisan conversations that are happening about resolving [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  this speakership crisis. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  I have no meetings planned with Henry, but high-level members on the Democratic side [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=155.12s)]
*  of the aisle are ready, willing and able to have those conversations. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  There have been ongoing informal conversations that have been undertaken over the last few [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=164.08s)]
*  days. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  I think there's a possibility those can accelerate now that Jim Jordan clearly does not have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  the votes to be speaker. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  Would you be open to some kind of pact, some sort of deal struck to elect a speaker that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  but in exchange for some sort of demands on rules or a vote on a CR or something like [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=189.2s)]
*  that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, obviously, we favor Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  This was the 16th time we've voted unanimously and passionately for Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=200.28s)]
*  He's a super well-organized, efficient, effective leader, and you can take him in his word. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  He's totally trustworthy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=211.28s)]
*  But if we can't get six Republicans to come over to our side, I've said from the beginning, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  there are a number of Republicans that I could support on a principled power-sharing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=218.0s)]
*  basis, assuming that our caucus were to endorse that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=223.04s)]
*  And we operate as a caucus. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=226.72s)]
*  We're not out there wheeling and dealing on our own. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=228.0s)]
*  But one of the things that I've said from the beginning is Liz Cheney would be a perfect [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=230.44s)]
*  choice herself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=234.84s)]
*  She was the chair of the Republican conference. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=235.84s)]
*  She was the number three Republican for several years while we're here, a very conservative [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=237.76s)]
*  Republican. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=243.36s)]
*  But she believes in the constitutional order. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=244.36s)]
*  And so we trust her. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=246.36s)]
*  Mitt Romney is another name that has been floated as someone who we could trust. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=248.52s)]
*  Angus King, who's the independent from Maine, is another person that we could look at. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=252.96s)]
*  And a lot of my colleagues, Chris, come from states where there have been state legislative [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=257.64s)]
*  power-sharing arrangements where gavels are shared, half of the committees to one side, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  half to the other side. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=268.2s)]
*  The parties can take turns holding the gavel during the week. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  It would be a very positive thing for us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=273.12s)]
*  We need to get aid to our Democratic allies in Ukraine and in Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=275.04s)]
*  We need to keep the government going. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  This is a very serious condition that the GOP chaos has plunged us into right now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=281.32s)]
*  As President Joe Biden prepared to head to Israel today, hundreds of people were killed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  at a hospital in Gaza City. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  Palestinian authorities say it was an Israeli airstrike that caused the carnage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=295.88s)]
*  The Israeli military says an errant rocket fired by Islamic Jihad militants was responsible. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=299.72s)]
*  That militant group denies it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=305.16s)]
*  Thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering at the Al-Athli hospital along with wounded [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=307.84s)]
*  patients and medical personnel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=311.88s)]
*  According to a member of Doctors Without Borders who was working in the hospital, quote, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=314.28s)]
*  we were operating in the hospital. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=317.4s)]
*  There was a strong explosion and the ceiling fell on the operating room. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=318.88s)]
*  This is a massacre. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=323.36s)]
*  Eamon Moeldin is the host of Eamon on MSNBC. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=324.96s)]
*  He reported extensively from Gaza, particularly during the 2014 war. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=327.52s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=331.4s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=332.4s)]
*  It's good to be here, Chris. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=333.4s)]
*  This is just an awful, awful and horrible situation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  The hospitals in Gaza tend to be locus of civilians precisely in hopes that there will [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=338.84s)]
*  be no bombing in those places. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=348.12s)]
*  And obviously, there are also places that can't be easily evacuated. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=354.0s)]
*  And this has been something that we've seen play out time and time again, where as a result [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=355.0s)]
*  of the evacuation orders that the Israelis gave, hospitals became de facto sheltered. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=358.76s)]
*  So not only are they treating the wounded as a result of the war, they are now also [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=364.68s)]
*  serving as a place where people felt that they can camp out and be safe for those that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=369.12s)]
*  couldn't make it all the way to the south or below the certain line that the Israelis [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=373.4s)]
*  had told them to try to get below in the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=377.88s)]
*  And we saw that at the Shifa hospital. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  There are about 35,000 people that are sheltered there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  This hospital had several thousand as well, not as many as Shifa, but this is a smaller [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=385.78s)]
*  hospital in the northern part of Gaza who coincidentally a couple of days ago when Israel [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=390.23999999999995s)]
*  told the northern part of the Gaza Strip to evacuate, they said, we can't evacuate. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=394.05999999999995s)]
*  We have people on machines. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=398.53999999999996s)]
*  We have people that physically we cannot take out of the situation that they're in medically. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  And so as a result, the hospital stayed open. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=405.21999999999997s)]
*  It was operating under stress because of a shortage of fuel and electricity, backup generators. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  And so people naturally who couldn't make it south ended up in the courtyard of that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=411.58s)]
*  hospital. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  And this is a Christian hospital. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  It's in the northern part. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  It's in that part that Israeli had instructed Palestinians to evacuate. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  Shifa hospitals in the south. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=423.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=424.46s)]
*  A little bit south. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=425.46s)]
*  Not all the way in the south, but a little bit south. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=426.46s)]
*  Yeah, in Gaza City. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=427.7s)]
*  Now, again, we do not know what happened here. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=428.7s)]
*  The Israeli defense forces say it was essentially an errant rocket from Islam al-Qihad, not [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=433.26s)]
*  that they were fired at their own hospital, but essentially they tried to fire it fell [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=438.26s)]
*  the Palestinian health ministry. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=442.18s)]
*  I think Hamas and Islam al-Qihad all say it was the Israeli defense forces. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  What we do know though is the news and the images that people have seen in the region [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=447.02s)]
*  are hundreds of people bleeding and dead in a hospital and that has had enormous consequences. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=453.54s)]
*  The image of the hospital officials, they held a press conference amidst the bodies [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=459.5s)]
*  of those that had died was one of the most jarring things I have ever seen. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=465.78s)]
*  They wanted the bodies there because they knew regardless of who is responsible, these [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  innocent people are killed as a result of this war. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  To your point, it did not take long for those images to have a ripple effect. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=476.78s)]
*  We have now seen protests in Jordan outside the Israeli embassy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=480.41999999999996s)]
*  We've seen protests in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Egypt. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=483.41999999999996s)]
*  I can assure you that tomorrow morning as more of this news spreads and more of these [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=487.41999999999996s)]
*  images spread, it is going to complicate the diplomatic efforts that are underway. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=490.82s)]
*  I think it puts the governments in the region in very dangerous positions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=495.29999999999995s)]
*  These are not, by the way, not democratic governments. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=499.42s)]
*  Let's be very clear about that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=501.42s)]
*  These are authoritarian governments that are sometimes the use force to suppress any kind [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=502.42s)]
*  of dissent or any kind of street protest. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=508.22s)]
*  But when it comes to this issue, these protests mobilize masses in places like Jordan where [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=510.38000000000005s)]
*  the population is 60 to 70 percent descendants of Palestinians in a place like Egypt that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=514.74s)]
*  is very emotionally attached to the Palestinian cause. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=519.1800000000001s)]
*  So you can expect that in the coming days these leaders of these countries and elsewhere [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=522.78s)]
*  are going to feel the pressure of what happened today in Gaza in their own capitals. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=527.26s)]
*  We should also just say here, and this is I think important, is again, independent of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=532.26s)]
*  what happened here, which we just do not know. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=535.84s)]
*  And I suspect there will be a projected conversation between U.S. officials and Israeli officials. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=537.88s)]
*  Independent of the hospital, as of I think four or five days ago, the Israeli Defense [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=544.72s)]
*  Forces said they dropped about 6,000 bombs on Gaza. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=549.48s)]
*  You know, Raqqa, which is the capital of the Islamic State when it was being taken, had [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=553.44s)]
*  4,000 bombs dropped on it, I think in a month. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  There is just no way this level of Arab bombardment is not going to result in many civilian casualties [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=561.12s)]
*  independent of this hospital strike. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=567.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when you're looking at the images, and again, we have to emphasize this, we don't [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=569.24s)]
*  have our own reporters on the ground to see this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=573.34s)]
*  So what we are relying on are the accounts of other journalists, credible organizations, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=575.82s)]
*  news organizations that have people there. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=580.2s)]
*  And what you can see, we're not talking about a building destroyed, we're talking about [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  whole neighborhoods destroyed, we're talking about multiple buildings being destroyed. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=586.68s)]
*  And one of the most complicated things in covering a war like this is that in many of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=590.36s)]
*  these residential areas, the Israeli government would take the position we're using precision [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=594.92s)]
*  weapons, we're using very guided munitions to hit specific targets. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=599.4s)]
*  That has not been the case according to the Israelis as a result in this particular war. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=604.52s)]
*  And so what we're seeing is that even in a residential neighborhood, if you're living [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=608.24s)]
*  in a building, if you're on a certain floor, but the floor below it has something that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=611.0999999999999s)]
*  the Israelis want to target, and if you're not there or you don't get the notice to evacuate, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=614.54s)]
*  you become a civilian casualty as a war. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=618.9799999999999s)]
*  Now, they've obviously been dropping the pamphlets, they've been making these phone calls, they [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=620.8599999999999s)]
*  have given the orders to evacuate. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=624.76s)]
*  But for some, it's just simply not enough. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=626.9799999999999s)]
*  People are not mobile, people can't get out of harm's way. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=629.5s)]
*  And when you're doing this kind of wholesale destruction of neighborhoods and buildings, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=633.14s)]
*  you can understand how it's impossible for some of these civilians to get out of harm's way. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=637.5s)]
*  Yeah, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, I think it's over 1,500 or 2,000. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=642.06s)]
*  As of now, it's hard to keep track. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=647.22s)]
*  They keep mounting them in Maldives. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=648.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysNN4edNZAo&t=650.38s)]
