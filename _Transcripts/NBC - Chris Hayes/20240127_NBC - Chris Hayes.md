# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Jan. 26
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0)
*  Today's verdict is due in large part to the tenacity of E. Jean Carroll who declared it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=0.0s)]
*  quote a great victory for everyone who stands up when she's knocked down. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=5.04s)]
*  A huge defeat for every bully who's tried to keep a woman down. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=8.76s)]
*  She went on to credit her amazing legal team for the win. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=12.34s)]
*  You can see her leaving the courtroom with key members of that team after the verdict [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=15.52s)]
*  came down. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  I'm all leaving the courthouse after the verdict. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  That's E. Jean Carroll in the middle with her lawyers Robbie Kaplan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=22.0s)]
*  Robbie Kaplan's on the right of your screen and Sean Crowley. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=25.12s)]
*  Sean Crowley joins me live here on set tonight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=30.96s)]
*  So great to be here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=31.96s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=32.96s)]
*  I'm feeling good. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=33.96s)]
*  You look, you came into the studio be beaming a smile that was clearly authentic and coming [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=34.96s)]
*  from the deepest part of you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=41.5s)]
*  It's been a good day. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=42.92s)]
*  I guess first did you anticipate this basically after the week that you had? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=45.1s)]
*  You know it's really hard to predict what juries are going to do. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=52.72s)]
*  I think we certainly anticipated that they would believe E. Jean Carroll's testimony. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=56.48s)]
*  It was credible. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=61.0s)]
*  It was moving. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=62.0s)]
*  Did we expect that the punitive damages award would be quite so high? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  I don't really know. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=67.8s)]
*  I mean the way that Donald Trump conducted himself throughout this case and then throughout [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=68.8s)]
*  this trial storming in and out of the courtroom, shaking his head, saying things very loudly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=72.88s)]
*  when he was sitting in the back, going, leaving the courtroom to repeatedly defame Miss Carroll [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=79.24s)]
*  while the trial was going on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=85.76s)]
*  The jury saw and heard all of those things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=87.56s)]
*  So we expected that there would be some award that would be high enough that they would [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=90.34s)]
*  think maybe we should actually penalize him and get him to stop doing this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=96.08s)]
*  So that was going to be my next question about his behavior here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=100.2s)]
*  And you're not a psychologist. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=102.88s)]
*  You just have to deal with it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=104.72s)]
*  But did you have like a tactical posture honestly about what to do about this? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=105.72s)]
*  Because I can't imagine as a litigator or even as a prosecutor you've ever faced something [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=111.56s)]
*  quite like this, have you? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=115.44s)]
*  I haven't, no. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=116.84s)]
*  I mean people don't do this in courtrooms. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=117.84s)]
*  They just don't. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=119.4s)]
*  Usually people who come into courtrooms for trials stay for the trial. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=120.4s)]
*  They don't walk out furiously and come in and say things when the jury can hear them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=124.24s)]
*  I haven't encountered anything like this before. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=129.2s)]
*  And so I guess the question becomes like to the extent there's any method to the madness, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=131.56s)]
*  I don't think there is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=136.44s)]
*  I think it's actually just incontinent ability to self-regulate. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=137.44s)]
*  What you do with it as attorneys and how you sort of keep on track, like was there [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=142.6s)]
*  a strategy for that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=147.56s)]
*  Our strategy was really just to remember that we were in a court of law and that we were [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=149.4s)]
*  trying this case to the jury and in front of a judge. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=153.12s)]
*  I think Donald Trump's strategy was much bigger than that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  He wasn't really as concerned with what was happening in the court of law and he was much [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=161.0s)]
*  more concerned with what was happening with his followers and fan base and at his rallies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=164.72s)]
*  So we just tried to focus on what we were actually doing and not get too distracted [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=169.84s)]
*  by the antics going on around outside. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=173.58s)]
*  I want to show you an image that one of our producers took a picture of this evening. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  I think we have it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=181.72s)]
*  Let me know if we do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=182.72s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=184.28s)]
*  This is outside Trump Tower here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=185.28s)]
*  E, 3.3 million. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=186.68s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=188.08s)]
*  Keep talking loser. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=189.08s)]
*  That was chalked outside the Trump International Television. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=190.08s)]
*  I thought you'd get a kick out of it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=193.08s)]
*  Tell me about what happens next year. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  His lawyer came out and said we've got great grounds for an appeal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=203.44s)]
*  Obviously lawyers always say that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=206.0s)]
*  They always say you're going to appeal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Obviously you get an appeal under due process in the same way you might in a criminal case. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  So what's the next step here? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=213.32s)]
*  We have every expectation that they will appeal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=215.22s)]
*  We feel very good about our arguments on appeal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=218.76s)]
*  We actually, as you said, there was a trial last year about the actual sexual assault [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=222.64s)]
*  and another defamation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=227.76s)]
*  And there the jury not only found that he sexually assaulted her but also awarded E. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=229.68s)]
*  Jean Carroll five million dollars. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=233.56s)]
*  That case is already on appeal. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=235.76s)]
*  The money has been paid into the court. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=238.56s)]
*  And so once we hope we win the appeal, that money will go to Miss Carroll. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=240.52s)]
*  This case likewise will be appealed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=246.12s)]
*  We feel confident in our arguments and ultimately she will collect that judgment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=248.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=252.16s)]
*  I don't want to be like this is a little minutiae but I actually want to get into it because [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=253.16s)]
*  I think there's always some sense. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=255.52s)]
*  It's like the road runner like above never falling where it's like is he going to have [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=257.88s)]
*  to pay up? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=262.92s)]
*  And so my understanding of the procedure is there's sort of basically like escrow where [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=263.92s)]
*  like you have to pony up the money into some account that sits there until the appeal is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=267.04s)]
*  done. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=270.84s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=271.84s)]
*  That's basically correct. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=272.84s)]
*  So like he's not going to be able to unless he wins on appeal, he's going to have to pay [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=273.84s)]
*  this money. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=276.56s)]
*  He's going to have to pay at least a big portion of this money before he even wins on appeal. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=277.56s)]
*  It has to be there to be certain that it's going to be there when we win the appeal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=281.84s)]
*  And then certainly after the appeal is we hope we're victorious on appeal, he's going [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=286.0s)]
*  to have to pay it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=291.0s)]
*  Can we talk about the pace of this? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=292.0s)]
*  So this starts in 2019. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=296.0s)]
*  One of the things I was talking about on this program last night is about the cliche that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=297.56s)]
*  the wheels of justice grind slow but exceedingly fine. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=301.12s)]
*  You've been a lawyer, you've worked in both criminal and civil contexts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=303.84s)]
*  I mean I'm just sort of awestruck by the endurance at some level. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=308.08s)]
*  Like four years of her life, E. Jean Carroll, what is your conclusion about how long this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=311.84s)]
*  takes to get this accountability? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=320.2s)]
*  So this case has been very long but sort of for extraordinary reasons. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=323.28s)]
*  E. Jean sued Donald Trump for something that he did first while he was president, for defaming [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=329.55999999999995s)]
*  her while he was president. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=334.96s)]
*  And because of that, he defended the case for many years, basically saying, first he [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=337.04s)]
*  got the Department of Justice to intervene on his behalf. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=343.64s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=346.84s)]
*  And then he claimed, well, you can't sue me for something that I did while I was president. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=348.0s)]
*  And then he claimed, well, I made those statements but I was acting within the scope of my employment [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=351.76s)]
*  as president. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=356.32s)]
*  My official duties. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=357.32s)]
*  It was my official duties to lie and defame this woman who accused me of sexual assault. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=358.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=363.0s)]
*  And so that took a while. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=364.0s)]
*  It wound its way through the courts here in New York. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=365.0s)]
*  It took a detour to D.C. for a while and it came back. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=367.04s)]
*  The other case actually moved extremely quickly. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=371.08s)]
*  Because he, just to be clear, and people probably don't know this, so the first is, E. Jean [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=374.16s)]
*  Carroll publishes the book, president defames her. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=377.32s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=379.68s)]
*  She sues him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=380.68s)]
*  Says, I want to go into court and prove this allegation that I'm telling the truth and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=381.68s)]
*  you're defaming me and you say I'm lying. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=385.24s)]
*  He used all of the powers of the presidency to protect himself. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=388.0s)]
*  Then he gets out of the White House and what happens? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=392.52s)]
*  A few days before his deposition in that case in October of 2022, he defames her again. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=395.16s)]
*  He says basically the same thing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=401.6s)]
*  And by that time, New York had actually passed a law that allowed survivors of sexual assaults [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=404.08s)]
*  that had happened a long time ago to sue. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=409.08s)]
*  It opened a one-year window where they could do that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=411.48s)]
*  So E. Jean filed another lawsuit in November of 2022 suing him both for the underlying [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=414.04s)]
*  sexual assault and for his defamation in October of 2022. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=419.68s)]
*  That case was filed November on Thanksgiving Day, I think, or the day after of 2022 and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=423.64s)]
*  went to trial last May. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=429.96s)]
*  Now this one comes back around. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=432.4s)]
*  He is no longer president. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=435.44s)]
*  Whatever civil immunity he may have had is gone. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=437.08s)]
*  Side note, you can understand why a person who has just had an $83 million judgment would [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  love to be president again with the cloak of legal protection that gave him in the past. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=446.56s)]
*  Just a note. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=452.94s)]
*  Ultimately, what is the lesson here though about accountability? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=455.38s)]
*  I hope and I believe very strongly after today that the lesson is that actually no one's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  above the law and that your behavior and your statements and your threats and your lies [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=465.18s)]
*  are going to catch up to you someday. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=473.14s)]
*  I have to say just I've not had an opportunity to meet your client, but I just I am completely [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=476.98s)]
*  in awe of her fortitude and endurance and ecstatic on her behalf. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=483.74s)]
*  Although I think and I think you've said this, it's like she would trade it to not have been [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=490.70000000000005s)]
*  defamed in the first place. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=494.06s)]
*  Yeah, she said that on the stand. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=495.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think it was certainly very important to her to come forward and then to defend [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=497.58000000000004s)]
*  herself when he called her a liar and defamed her. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=501.94s)]
*  But the reputation that she has now is among a very large group of people really ruined [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=506.24s)]
*  by Donald Trump. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=512.76s)]
*  And what she really wants is to be that journalist and advice columnist that she was before he [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=514.24s)]
*  lied about her. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  Sean Crowley, you and Robbie Kaplan did amazing work. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=520.92s)]
*  Congratulations on a well-earned victory from my perspective. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=524.4s)]
*  Happy birthday to this birthday gift. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=526.88s)]
*  Donald Trump just had his worst ever day in court for now. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=529.52s)]
*  Politically speaking, though, the ex-president shouldn't be riding high. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=532.76s)]
*  He just handily won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=536.04s)]
*  He's cruising right now towards his third nomination for president. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=540.0s)]
*  Polls show he has a real chance of winning back the White House. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=543.9599999999999s)]
*  But instead of spending his time focused on all that, focused on his race, he has been [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  showing up to and storming out of a New York courtroom. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=550.38s)]
*  He has been spending his days effectively, doggedly, reminding everyone that he was already [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Keep in mind, this comes in the context of Trump once again becoming the standard bearer [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=563.32s)]
*  for a Republican party that has a glaring problem with women voters. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=567.72s)]
*  Of course, that's long been true. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=572.6s)]
*  It was true from the moment Trump was inaugurated when millions of people joined the first women's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  marches in protest against him, in large part due to his history of rampant misogyny and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=578.36s)]
*  allegations of sexual abuse. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=583.44s)]
*  And this righteous anger was supercharged when Trump's three hand-picked Supreme Court [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=585.7600000000001s)]
*  justices overturned a half century precedent, allowing Republican states to criminalize [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=590.52s)]
*  abortion. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=595.8199999999999s)]
*  And we are now every day seeing the dire consequences of that decision. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  Women forced to flee their home states to get the medical care they require. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=602.78s)]
*  Women forced to give birth to babies who will not survive outside the womb and to watch [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  their death in their arms. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=612.48s)]
*  Women forced to carry non-viable pregnancies until they are in dire enough medical condition [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=614.36s)]
*  to get treatment. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=620.28s)]
*  Women forced to give birth to the children of the men who raped them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=621.88s)]
*  That's not an edge case, by the way. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=625.8s)]
*  In fact, a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=627.6s)]
*  in Texas alone, more than 26,000 women have become pregnant as a result of rape since [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=631.92s)]
*  the state outlawed abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=638.8199999999999s)]
*  Take a second to think about that number and what each one of those women has had to go [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=643.64s)]
*  through. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  It's maddening and unthinkably cruel. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=650.06s)]
*  It is the reality in this country because of Donald Trump and Republican men like him. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=652.3399999999999s)]
*  To this day, their effort continues, day in, day out, to take away women's bodily autonomy, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=658.6999999999999s)]
*  to have the state control them and their bodies like vessels. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=662.9799999999999s)]
*  In Wisconsin, latest example, a 50-50 state politically, Democratic governor, and a Republican [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=666.6199999999999s)]
*  supermajority in the state Senate, the MAGA movement is trying to outlaw abortion after [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=672.42s)]
*  just 14 weeks. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=677.28s)]
*  And just take a listen, seriously, listen to their justification for it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=678.66s)]
*  If you believe that a fetus is a human life, then abortion is not health care. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=684.98s)]
*  In my veterinary career, I did thousands of ultrasounds on animals, determining pregnancy [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=692.5s)]
*  and that kind of thing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=701.02s)]
*  I think I know mammalian fetal development better than probably anyone here. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=702.02s)]
*  And in my mind, there's absolutely no question that's a life. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=707.16s)]
*  And I think the science backs me up on that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=711.24s)]
*  Oh, thank you, veterinarian Joel Kitchens, comparing women to animals. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=713.6s)]
*  These kind of naked leap misogynistic comments used to end careers are like when Republican [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=720.88s)]
*  Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin said this about pregnancy as a result of rape back in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=725.0799999999999s)]
*  2012. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=729.3199999999999s)]
*  First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=731.2600000000001s)]
*  If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=734.86s)]
*  But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=740.34s)]
*  You know, I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be in the rapist [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=743.2600000000001s)]
*  and not attacking the child. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=747.36s)]
*  Akin became a national embarrassment, rightly, after those comments. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=749.7600000000001s)]
*  He lost his Senate race by 15 points. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=752.62s)]
*  Today, in Donald Trump's MAGA party, men like that have been empowered. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=754.7s)]
*  They got their hands on the reins. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=759.52s)]
*  When Trump defames E. Jean Carroll over and over, or calls the woman currently challenging [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=762.22s)]
*  him for the nomination, Birdbrain, it gives permission to other MAGA men to behave the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=766.06s)]
*  same way. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=770.22s)]
*  And they do. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=771.22s)]
*  To decide that they are experts in, let me see here again, mammalian fetal development. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=772.34s)]
*  And they can tell you what you're going to do with your mammalian uterus. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=778.6999999999999s)]
*  That is the agenda to control women across this country, either by bullying and defamation [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=785.34s)]
*  or through legislation. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQlZ6UUx-0&t=791.6s)]
