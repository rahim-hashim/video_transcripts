# Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su How Bidenomics is fueling union power
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA)
*  The writers and actors strike has basically frozen all TV and movie production. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=0.0s)]
*  There have been some talks between the production companies and the two unions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=4.72s)]
*  As of now, there still appears to be no end in sight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=10.28s)]
*  And it's not just the entertainment industry. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=12.76s)]
*  Auto workers, flight attendants, New Jersey transit engineers all have voted [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=14.72s)]
*  to authorize their unions to strike. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=19.28s)]
*  Part of the reason we're seeing this huge [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=22.16s)]
*  uptake in labor, militancy and strikes right now is that the economy is booming. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=23.64s)]
*  Labor market is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=27.64s)]
*  Today, we got the latest example of that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=29.04s)]
*  We got the August jobs report. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=31.12s)]
*  The U.S. added one hundred eighty seven thousand new jobs, exceeding expectations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=32.84s)]
*  once again, bringing the labor participation rate up to its highest level since February 2020. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=36.68s)]
*  And joining me now is acting Labor Secretary Julie Hsu. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Secretary, the jobs number today came in above expectations, though does show [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=48.64s)]
*  deceleration in the in the job growth overtrend. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=53.92s)]
*  Are you are you concerned about that or do you think this is coming in for the kind [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=58.96s)]
*  of much vaunted soft landing people are really, really hoping for? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=62.32s)]
*  Exactly, Chris. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=65.84s)]
*  This is what you'd want to see if you want to see a soft landing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=67.12s)]
*  This is what is we know is strong and steady growth after the very hot and rapid [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=71.12s)]
*  recovery under President Biden, 13.5 million jobs created, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=78.84s)]
*  record low levels of unemployment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=82.48s)]
*  This is the transition to the kind of strong, stable economy that we want. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=84.16s)]
*  So there's a lot of labor activity and labor [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=88.84s)]
*  militancy going on this summer, of course, as I mentioned before, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=91.36s)]
*  you've got the writers and the actors on strike. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  You've got the strike authorization vote for the the auto workers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=96.64s)]
*  I think that deadlines in two weeks. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  Do you see a role for the Department of Labor, the White House, the president in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  those negotiations? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=107.16s)]
*  Well, the president has said that he is the most pro-union, pro-labor president [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=108.76s)]
*  that we've had, and part of that is economic policies that have created a tight labor [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=114.12s)]
*  market, which give workers more power. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=118.6s)]
*  Part of that is our recognition of the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=121.27999999999999s)]
*  collective bargaining process, why it's important, how it works and respecting the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=123.72s)]
*  parties. So we get involved if we think we can be helpful, but we also respect the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  parties and their need and willingness to grapple through some hard issues and find [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  win-win solutions themselves. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=137.24s)]
*  Well, I want to come back to one of the more high profile labor battles that's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=139.4s)]
*  happened under the Biden administration, for which the president took some some [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=143.6s)]
*  criticism, and that was the the railroad unions and the railroad companies, a number [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=146.92s)]
*  of unions, because of the way that railroad labor disputes are sort of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  statutorily governed, it's possible to basically unilaterally [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  sort of foist an agreement on the parties in order to avoid a railroad strike. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=160.88s)]
*  That was done. And at the end of that process, the big ask from the railroad labor [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=165.44s)]
*  unions was for sick paid sick days, which they didn't have. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=170.11999999999998s)]
*  My understanding is that subsequent to that, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  there actually have been additional rounds of bargaining that have led to a number of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=175.72s)]
*  those companies and unions actually securing paid sick days now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=181.12s)]
*  Is that right? That's exactly right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=184.52s)]
*  So that demonstrates, too, that the collective bargaining process sort of, you know, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=186.72s)]
*  it's not it's not like a one and done situation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened is workers wanted paid sick days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=193.56s)]
*  And one thing that we saw, certainly through the pandemic, is just how untenable it is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  to have workers not having any kind of paid days where they can just take off when [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=203.48s)]
*  they need to because they're sick, because a family member is sick. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=208.48s)]
*  And so the rail workers have gotten that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=211.48s)]
*  And that's just one example of many in which unions and employers have come [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=214.24s)]
*  together to the bargaining table and reached really historic wins. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=219.28s)]
*  We see that in the West Coast ports, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=222.56s)]
*  Twenty nine ports. I'll WU made historic demands. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=224.44s)]
*  And they just ratified that contract. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, the teamsters and UPS, same thing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=230.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And that was another one that looked like it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=234.72s)]
*  I think there was also a strike authorization vote there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  They did not have to go to strike. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=240.72s)]
*  They came to a deal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  You've been around labor your whole life and career. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  You worked representing folks that were workers, garment workers. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=248.2s)]
*  You're now you've been a policy person. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=252.88s)]
*  You're now the acting secretary of labor. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=254.92s)]
*  What do you what is your belief about why [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=257.12s)]
*  we are seeing the level of labor activism, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=259.72s)]
*  militancy organizing that we're seeing this year in the last two years? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=262.88s)]
*  I think it's a few things. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=268.36s)]
*  One is that we are coming off a global [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=269.88s)]
*  pandemic and the pandemic induced economic catastrophe that has given a lot [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=272.12s)]
*  of people some room to take stock and workers are realizing that for a long [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=276.92s)]
*  time, workers have not gotten their fair share, that there has been growing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=282.16s)]
*  inequality, that there's been declining unionization for the last about four [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  decades, stagnant wages, and workers are realizing that in this moment [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=291.36s)]
*  they want better and they deserve better. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  Another part of it is that a strong labor [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  movement and a worker centered economy is very much part of Bidenomics. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=303.12s)]
*  It's the president's entire vision for how we build a strong workforce, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=307.6s)]
*  profitable employers and a strong nation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  Final question for you is about a regulation the Department of Labor just [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=316.04s)]
*  promulgated, if I'm not mistaken, on overtime pay. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=318.92s)]
*  This is one of those things where, again, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=321.48s)]
*  these things can happen sort of deep in the administrative state. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=323.52s)]
*  They sort of wind through. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  They get announced, but they have incredibly important tangible [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=327.04s)]
*  consequences for people. Explain to me the new rule, which my [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=330.12s)]
*  understanding would make several million more workers eligible for overtime pay. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=333.04s)]
*  That's right. So all of our rulemaking is extremely transparent, Chris. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=337.6s)]
*  You know, they go through a process. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=341.64s)]
*  It was publicly announced. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=343.32s)]
*  And now there's a comment period before it gets finalized. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=344.84s)]
*  But the overtime rule is really about that American promise that if you put in a fair [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  days, a hard day's work, you should get just days pay, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=355.52s)]
*  A fair day's pay for a hard day's work. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=358.84s)]
*  And it will when finalized, if at this standard, it would get about three point [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=361.2s)]
*  six million workers who are currently not eligible for overtime, overtime. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=367.24s)]
*  And that's just to protect people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=372.0s)]
*  If you work over 40 hours in a week, you should be paid for it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=373.12s)]
*  Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su on this Labor Day weekend. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=376.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for making some time for us. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much, Chris. Happy Labor Day to you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKH7hmgFKA&t=381.76s)]
