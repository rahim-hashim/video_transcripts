# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Dec. 8
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4)
*  At the highest levels of the Republican Party, there's all this talk recently about how reasonable they're going to be about abortion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=0.0s)]
*  Nikki Haley talking about humanizing her position to Donald Trump portraying himself as a moderate, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=6.0s)]
*  ludicrously and pointing to exceptions as a way to sell Republican abortion bans, a sentiment echoed by other politicians. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=12.0s)]
*  I do believe that there should be exceptions that are made. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=20.0s)]
*  Probably most people are about 15 weeks with all the exceptions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=23.0s)]
*  Of course you have to have some reasonable exceptions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=26.0s)]
*  That's the way they all talk now, Republicans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=29.0s)]
*  Exceptions, of course there are always exceptions. You guys want exceptions, we'll give you exceptions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=31.0s)]
*  You don't want to be harmed by abortion bans. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=34.0s)]
*  What do they actually do though when they have the power? What do they do? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=36.0s)]
*  We can look. Here's a test case in Texas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=39.0s)]
*  A state with a near total ban on abortion controlled entirely by Republicans with criminal penalties for doctors up to life in prison. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=42.0s)]
*  And Kate Cox lives in Texas with her husband and two children near Dallas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=49.0s)]
*  She is 20 weeks pregnant. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=54.0s)]
*  But doctors tragically just discovered the baby she is carrying has a rare genetic condition that will almost certainly result in a still birth or death soon after birth. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=56.0s)]
*  Kate Cox asked a judge to make an exception to Texas law to allow her to get an abortion so she can protect her health and crucially also her future fertility, which is threatened. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=66.0s)]
*  Yesterday, a judge under extraordinary circumstances agreed issuing an order allowing her to obtain that medical care. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=76.0s)]
*  And then immediately the Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, threatened to jail her doctor and sue the hospital or any hospital that performs it if they provide this abortion care. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=83.0s)]
*  He is now petitioning the Texas Supreme Court to prevent Kate Cox from getting the reproductive care that her doctor say she needs from getting an exception to the state's abortion ban. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=95.0s)]
*  Eleanor Klebenoff is the women's health reporter for the Texas Tribune where she's been closely following this story and she joins me now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=108.0s)]
*  Eleanor, can you just tell me a little bit more about Kate Cox and how this sort of came about? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=116.0s)]
*  Sure. So Kate Cox is 31 years old. She lives in Dallas. She already has two kids. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=123.0s)]
*  She and her husband really wanted this pregnancy. They were excited when they found out they were pregnant. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=128.0s)]
*  And then they learned that, you know, they've received the diagnosis that no parent wants to receive, you know, that they're this much wanted pregnancy would not result in a happy, healthy baby. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=134.0s)]
*  In fact, probably, you know, if she delivered a baby, it would survive just hours or days. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=144.0s)]
*  She is asking, as you said, or she asked a judge to give her an abortion and or allow her to have an abortion. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=151.0s)]
*  And this is sort of the case that I think lawyers and advocates have been waiting for in Texas to challenge these laws and see what we do now that we've got this test case. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that's so pernicious, I think, from my perspective about how these laws function is that the criminal penalties are so severe, along with possible civil penalties, that there's a there's a sort of just suffocating risk aversion for anyone that might try to practice this reproductive care. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=171.0s)]
*  And people in the anti-abortion movement and said, well, they're being too cautious. And actually, they're these are ridiculous stories that shouldn't happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=189.0s)]
*  But then you've got Paxton making it clear that he intends to use every available tool of law for retribution against the practitioner, the doctor who might actually provide Kate Cox the care she needs. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=195.0s)]
*  Right. The state's argument is, you know, the problem is not the law. The problem is the doctors and how they're choosing to interpret the law. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=211.0s)]
*  Then, you know, we've got this case. And as you said, this doctor has basically was told by a judge that she I mean, the doctor is named in the lawsuit that said she'll be protected if she performs this abortion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=217.0s)]
*  And Attorney General Ken Paxton, as the Center for Reproductive Rights has framed it, you know, really trying to cow these hospitals and convince them to not take on the risk of performing this abortion and sort of closing all the doors available to the patient. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=229.0s)]
*  And that's not possible to this woman if she were to try to seek this abortion in Texas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he could obviously he doesn't have to write the letter he wrote yesterday or file the petition. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=250.0s)]
*  He the rid of mandamus today. This is the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Ms. Cox saying that the state's mandamus position is stunning in its disregard for Ms. Cox's life, fertility and the rule of law. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=255.0s)]
*  We should also note that this is not only happening in Texas. You're a Texas reporter. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=267.0s)]
*  We've seen similar stories in Florida. We saw a story of a woman in a similar situation who was forced to carry to term her a fetus that that that gasped for air and lived very briefly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=272.0s)]
*  That was the law. And then Kentucky, you've got a class action suit that's asking a judge to block enforcement of Kentucky's trigger law and six weeks abortion ban. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=288.0s)]
*  The one of the plaintiffs and other pregnant women who wish to no longer be pregnant are suffering mental constitutional reprobable harm because they are denied the ability to obtain an abortion. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=296.0s)]
*  We've seen a lot of legal challenges. Where does this go next? Is the Texas State Supreme Court going to weigh in on this? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=303.0s)]
*  Yes, we are essentially waiting for the Texas Supreme Court to tell us what happens next here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=312.0s)]
*  You know, everyone is on the edge of their seat. You know, the Texas Supreme Court is also considering this larger case that has 20 plaintiffs that, you know, they've already heard arguments in that case that sort of proceeding on the normal timeline. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=317.0s)]
*  It'll be weeks or months before we get a ruling on that case. This case, for obvious reasons, moving a lot faster. We expect a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court tonight, this weekend. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=330.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=340.0s)]
*  Is there, I mean, obviously Paxton is a special snowflake. You know, he is notorious in Texas politics. He just survived an impeachment. He's had an indictment for a very long period of time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=341.0s)]
*  He's an incredibly polarizing and I would dare say a reviled figure by many, even in Republican politics in the state of Texas have other state leaders. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=355.0s)]
*  Greg Abbott, the senators in that state, Cornyn and Cruz, have they as ever other people chimed in to say what they think should happen to this woman who is fighting to obtain the reproductive care that she needs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=365.0s)]
*  We have not heard widespread commentary on this case from elected leaders. I'll be honest, abortion in some ways has become a little bit of a radioactive topic. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=381.0s)]
*  Now that we're sort of seeing how some of this plays out early on, right after the Dobbs decision, Governor Greg Abbott said, you know, he'd like to see some clarity in the law and in the exceptions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=391.0s)]
*  Now that that's sort of playing out in front of the courts, we're probably hearing people saying, you know, they just want to wait and see what the courts do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=401.0s)]
*  But I'll say we had a legislative session earlier this year. Texas has spent most of this year in special sessions and there has not been any talk about adding to the exceptions, clarifying the exceptions or really changing anything to do with the law. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=407.0s)]
*  So the legislators seem to be pretty much content with the way things are or at least content to see what the Texas Supreme Court does. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=421.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is this is the policy of the state of Texas, its legislators, its governor, its attorney general who have put this regime together that now has Ms. Cox in the situation. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=429.0s)]
*  She's in Eleanor, Cleveland. Thank you very much. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=439.0s)]
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today, a Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals panel upheld a gag order against Donald Trump in the criminal case about his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=442.0s)]
*  The three-judge panel narrowed the original order from District Court Judge Tonya Chetkin somewhat, ruling that special counsel Jack Smith, originally included in that order, is now fair game. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=454.0s)]
*  But crucially, the judges barred the ex-president from talking publicly about Smith's staff, court staff or other lawyers on the case. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=464.0s)]
*  He is also prohibited from making, and I quote here, public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=472.0s)]
*  So as of this ruling, Donald Trump is legally restricted from attacking any of the potential witnesses against him in the coup trial. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=484.0s)]
*  This is a big ruling with big implications. We're going to talk all about that shortly. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=492.0s)]
*  But one of those witnesses could very well be this man, Kenneth Chesbrough, unindicted co-conspirator number five in Jack Smith's federal indictment of Donald Trump. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=496.0s)]
*  And of all the characters in the coup plot, and we've followed them all, Chesbrough may be the most mysterious with the most obscure motives. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=507.0s)]
*  He also may prove to be one of the most important. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=515.0s)]
*  Kenneth Chesbrough had an unexpected path to plotting Donald Trump's coup. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=518.0s)]
*  He's a graduate of Harvard Law, where he worked as a research assistant for the liberal constitutional law scholar Lawrence Tribe. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=522.0s)]
*  He later helped Tribe represent Al Gore after the 2000 election. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=529.0s)]
*  He was a registered Democrat, donated to Democratic candidates, but Chesbrough's political leaning started to shift after he made a fortune investing in cryptocurrency. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=533.0s)]
*  He joined the conservative legal movement representing Republican politicians, and he got pulled into the Trump election scheme by the lead attorney for Trump in Wisconsin, who Chesbrough had worked with in recent years. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=542.0s)]
*  Chesbrough became one of the masterminds of the coup plot, working in the inner circle with lawyers like John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani, who are also indicted in Georgia. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=553.0s)]
*  He devised what became known as the fake electors plot, as the January 6th Committee explained last summer. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=563.0s)]
*  On November 18th, a lawyer working with the Trump campaign named Kenneth Chesbrough wrote a memo arguing that the Trump campaign should organize its own electors in the swing states that President Trump had lost. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=571.0s)]
*  Mr. Chesbrough wrote to Mayor Giuliani that the vice president is charged with, quote, making judgments about what to do if there are conflicting votes, close quote. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=583.0s)]
*  Mr. Chesbrough wrote that when the joint session of Congress got to Arizona in the alphabetical list of states, the vice president should not count the Biden votes, quote, because there are two slates of votes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=595.0s)]
*  That was a big innovation, right, in this desire and plot to overturn a free and fair election. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=608.0s)]
*  You'll also note that Kenneth Chesbrough was still so obscure a character at that point that no one knew how to pronounce his name properly. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=615.0s)]
*  We went back and forth here for like six months. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=622.0s)]
*  We only learned it when he said it himself in front of a Georgia judge. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=624.0s)]
*  In August, Chesbrough was one of 19 co-defendants indicted in the Georgia election interference case. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=628.0s)]
*  At first, he tried this gambit to basically jam up the prosecution by demanding, as was his right under federal law, a speedy trial, like a real speedy trial, in a few months. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=634.0s)]
*  But then just days before that speedy trial was set to begin, Chesbrough accepted a plea deal. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=644.0s)]
*  Please lower your hand and state your true and correct legal name. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=652.0s)]
*  Kenneth John Chesbrough. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=654.0s)]
*  Do you understand that this is a negotiated plea, which means your attorneys and the state have reached a negotiated recommendation to make to the court? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=656.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=663.0s)]
*  Chesbrough, we all said in the newsroom. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=664.0s)]
*  Chesbrough pleaded guilty to one felony charge. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=666.0s)]
*  He was sentenced to five years probation. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=669.0s)]
*  He was also able, crucially, as a condition of this plea, to keep his law license because of how that crime was categorized. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=671.0s)]
*  Now, when Chesbrough pleaded, he also agreed to testify against his co-defendants, but it was not clear if he had flipped in the way we colloquially understand. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=678.0s)]
*  Was he now going to tell all like Michael Cohen, or was this a begrudging move to avoid a worse legal fate? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=687.0s)]
*  Chesbrough's lawyers indicated that it was, in fact, the latter, that Donald Trump had nothing to fear from his client. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=694.0s)]
*  I want to make something clear. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=700.0s)]
*  He did not implicate anyone else. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=703.0s)]
*  He implicated himself in that particular charge. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=705.0s)]
*  Someone asked me earlier, if you were Donald Trump, would you be worried? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=709.0s)]
*  And I could personally, honestly answer, no. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=713.0s)]
*  And it's not that Mr. Chesbrough is trying to protect Donald Trump or anyone else. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=715.0s)]
*  He's not. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=720.0s)]
*  He's ready to move on with his life. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=721.0s)]
*  So that sort of seemed to close the book on Chesbrough until late last month when we started hearing about his possible cooperation in other inquiries. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=723.0s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, among Chesbrough and his 18 co-defendants in Georgia are some of the actual fake electors, the people who showed up to swear, sign an affidavit saying, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=732.0s)]
*  I am the duly elected elector, despite the fact they were not. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=742.0s)]
*  Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote in their state. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=746.0s)]
*  That's what they were claiming, right? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=749.0s)]
*  Several other states are prosecuting those groups of fake electors as well in these individual states in which they met. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=751.0s)]
*  The state of Michigan charged 16 people in the fake electors scheme in July. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=757.0s)]
*  According to a new report, Chesbrough is cooperating with prosecutors in Michigan whose investigation may be broader than previously known. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=761.0s)]
*  We just learned that Chesbrough is also cooperating in Wisconsin, indicating that the attorney general there may also be investigating their fake electors. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=769.0s)]
*  This week, 10 Wisconsin Republicans who posed as fake electors settled a civil lawsuit, not criminal trial, civil lawsuit. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=777.0s)]
*  And to settle it, they had to acknowledge that Joe Biden did win their state. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=784.0s)]
*  Now, we've got criminal investigations also brewing in other states, both Nevada and Arizona, where Kenneth Chesbrough has reportedly become a key cooperator. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=788.0s)]
*  In fact, he testified before a grand jury in Nevada where six fake electors, including the state Republican Party chair, were indicted this week. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=797.0s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that Chesbrough is scheduled to meet with investigators in Arizona on Monday. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=805.0s)]
*  So all this really makes you wonder whether Chesbrough actually has flipped in some meaningful sense and what that could mean for Donald Trump who remains in serious legal peril. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=812.0s)]
*  Christy Greenberg serves as federal prosecutor in the southern district of New York where she was deputy chief of the criminal division. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=821.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Tubin is an attorney and legal analyst who studied with Chesbrough at Harvard Law School in the 1980s. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=826.0s)]
*  And I'll start with you, Jeffrey, because of all the characters here, I feel like I got a good beat on John Eastman. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=831.0s)]
*  I know Rudy Giuliani has been the public eye for a very long time. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=835.0s)]
*  Chesbrough remains the most mysterious. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=839.0s)]
*  The only person I've ever seen write anything on like, what's the deal with Kenneth Chesbrough, is you. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=841.0s)]
*  What's the deal with him? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=846.0s)]
*  The correct pronunciation is the cheese, because that's how he was known in law school. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=847.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=852.0s)]
*  It is, yes. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=853.0s)]
*  He's from Wisconsin, so there's kind of a cheese thing going on there. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=854.0s)]
*  It's a very weird story. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=857.0s)]
*  I mean, Ken, whom I did know pretty well in law school, hadn't had a lot of context since then. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=859.0s)]
*  I then wrote about him for Air Mail. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=864.0s)]
*  He is a very low key person. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=866.0s)]
*  He is not someone who seeks a lot of attention. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=869.0s)]
*  He has been an individual appellate lawyer, never with a full law firm in all the years since we graduated from law school. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=871.0s)]
*  But he did go through what seems to be a very consequential midlife crisis a few years ago. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=879.0s)]
*  He got divorced from his longtime wife, part of a midlife crisis. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=886.0s)]
*  He started investing in crypto, made a fortune, tried to get Larry Tribe, his mentor, to invest in crypto as well. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=890.0s)]
*  And most significantly, as far as we're concerned here, went from being a pretty serious Democrat. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=899.0s)]
*  He worked with a lot of plaintiffs' lawyers who tend to be Democrats, to being a right-wing activist, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=906.0s)]
*  big contributor to Ron Johnson, the senator from Wisconsin, to President Trump. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=913.0s)]
*  And now, a major figure in the sham electors. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=919.0s)]
*  It's bizarre. Can I give you the inside story of why I don't? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=925.0s)]
*  But that's more than most people. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=930.0s)]
*  I mean, it's the classic divorce to crypto to coup trajectory that you see so often in midlife crisis. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=932.0s)]
*  Since President Biden took office nearly three years ago, we've been inundated with a seemingly never-ending series of moral panics in the media. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=940.0s)]
*  It should come as no surprise that this trend was particularly pronounced in right-wing media, like with the so-called shoplifting epidemic. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=947.0s)]
*  Obviously, no one denies shoplifting exists. Of course, it happens. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=954.0s)]
*  But perhaps the reality doesn't merit the breathless coverage it receives on Fox News. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=957.0s)]
*  In fact, as the New York Times reported last month, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=963.0s)]
*  it appears less common in most of the country than it was before the pandemic. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=977.0s)]
*  Less common. You hear that? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=981.0s)]
*  Now, among the loudest voices in this propaganda campaign were the retail companies themselves, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=983.0s)]
*  who took every opportunity to complain about the so-called shoplifting epidemic. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=988.0s)]
*  If you look a little deeper, though, you'll find multiple occasions retailers have cited shoplifting as a major reason for declining profits, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=993.0s)]
*  only for the reality to be more complicated. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1000.0s)]
*  Like, for instance, when Target announced it was closing a flagship location in Manhattan due to shoplifting, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1003.0s)]
*  only for the building's landlord to reveal the company was actually moving to a smaller location nearby, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1009.0s)]
*  adding, quote, the retailer didn't raise theft as an issue leading up to the announcement. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1014.0s)]
*  Sometimes the concession comes from the company itself, like when the CFO of Walgreens told investors earlier this year, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1019.0s)]
*  and I quote him here, maybe we cried too much about shoplifting in 2022. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1026.0s)]
*  The silver bullet argument for proponents of the shoplifting epidemic was an analysis from the National Retail Federation released earlier this year, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1032.0s)]
*  which said that organized theft accounted for nearly half of all retail losses in 2021. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1040.0s)]
*  So not just petty thieves, but there was this new epidemic of organized crime ring storming stores and taking everything. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1045.0s)]
*  That report was widely cited in the media, and fear-mongering about organized retail crime was everywhere. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1052.0s)]
*  But the facts in that study were way wrong, and it's important to unpack just what happened. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1059.0s)]
*  As I mentioned earlier, the National Retail Federation released a report saying that organized theft accounted for nearly half of all retail losses. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1064.0s)]
*  Now, they got that stat from the Senate testimony of an anti-shoplifting expert in 2021. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1073.0s)]
*  I want to share firsthand today what I've experienced over 30 years of working on this problem. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1081.0s)]
*  Organized retail crime represents a massive and growing threat to the tune of $45 billion a year. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1087.0s)]
*  Well, he seems credible. He's up there. He's got the microphone. He's a witness. He's sworn in. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1093.0s)]
*  Except it seems the facts may have been flubbed. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1098.0s)]
*  As the New York Times now reports, quote, that man was citing a, get this, 2016 survey, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1101.0s)]
*  which was actually referring to the overall cost of shrink in 2015, not the amount lost to just organized retail crime. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1108.0s)]
*  That's a huge distinction. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1116.0s)]
*  The source for the widely shared claim that there was this new trend, this new phenomenon, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1118.0s)]
*  organized retail theft that accounted for half of all retail losses in 2021 coming out of the pandemic, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1125.0s)]
*  in Joe Biden's chaotic America, was actually a statistic about all retail inventory loss, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1131.0s)]
*  everything from lost merchandise to damaged product, from six years earlier. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1137.0s)]
*  They have nothing to do with each other. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1141.0s)]
*  The claim has been totally debunked. In fact, get this, the National Retail Federation was forced to retract it, but not before. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1144.0s)]
*  We are learning tonight that organized crime is behind the $70 billion retail theft crisis in this country. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1159.0s)]
*  Perfect example of why you should be skeptical of the way some bad faith actors try to frame news [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1166.0s)]
*  about particularly the economy and crime. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1172.0s)]
*  I'll have much more to say to help some of the same characters who are trying to undermine some good news for Bidenomics next. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1175.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvNlEZx4v4&t=1202.0s)]
