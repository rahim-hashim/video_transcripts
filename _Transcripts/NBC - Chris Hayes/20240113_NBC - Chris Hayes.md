# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Jan. 12
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It is here. Well, almost here. On Monday, Republicans will cast their ballots in the Iowa caucuses. It will be the first time since the January 6th insurrection. The voters will see Donald Trump's name on the ballot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=0.0s)]
*  And a whole lot of those voters are going to support him. They're going to say, yeah, yep, we want the guy that tried to steal the last election and is now facing years in prison for doing it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=15.0s)]
*  It's already been a very weird campaign for a lot of reasons. I mean, we started with a huge field of candidates. Remember that? And most of them have either dropped out or just faded into the background before the votes are cast. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=25.0s)]
*  Like they got winnowed out fast. And when they are cast in three days, voters will be breathing snow and sub-zero temperatures in what is expected to be the coldest caucuses ever, which is saying something because there's been a lot of cold caucuses. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=36.0s)]
*  Despite the cold, leading challengers Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are dutifully trudging across the state trying to drum up support. They will most likely still lose if polling is any indication that we don't know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=50.0s)]
*  They could lose by historic margin to a frontrunner who, let's be clear, has spent more time in court attending his civil fraud trial this week than he has in the state of Iowa. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=62.0s)]
*  And even if now it feels inevitable that we would come to this, it was not inevitable. It really wasn't. There was a time in winter 2021 after January 6 when Donald Trump was being impeached for inciting the Capitol insurrection, his approval rating hit an all-time low. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=74.0s)]
*  It looked like he could very well be sent into a sort of permanent political exile. And then he sort of came back and then the 2022 midterms, the elections worked out poorly for most Trump endorsed candidates. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=91.0s)]
*  He backed losers in a ton of winnable races and there seemed to be a dawning awareness in the Republican Party that he was politically toxic. And 2024 could be a wide open race for Republicans. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=104.0s)]
*  All those folks got in because they thought he was beatable. Not now. Now Trump is polling at 54%, more than 30 points ahead of Haley, his closest challenger. It is not even close enough to say it's not even close. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=114.0s)]
*  Of course, the only poll that matters is the one on election day, as we like to say here. But there's already a lot of discussion about sort of how we got here, right, on the threshold of this moment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=125.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of factors that have brought us to this point in which Trump is, you know, leading by 30 or 40 points. There is the terrible, I mean truly almost historically terrible campaign of Ron DeSantis, who once looked like a formidable challenger. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=136.0s)]
*  There's the growing desire in the Republican electorate for authoritarian politics. And that's fueled by this ever sort of radicalizing conservative media industry. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=150.0s)]
*  There is, of course, the complete personal cowardice of Republican leaders who could have voted to convict Trump during impeachment. We wouldn't have this problem, but who've also run interference for Trump all along. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=161.0s)]
*  So all of those factors are here. But there is one factor on the eve of this first contest. There's one factor I think does not get enough play. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=170.0s)]
*  And that's the tools of mob menace, the coercion, the threats of violence the Trump and MAGA movements employ that are constantly shaping the space in which the race is itself contested. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=180.0s)]
*  I talked yesterday about this, about the bomb threat at the home of the judge in Trump's civil trial and how it was not an isolated incident. It wasn't just business as usual. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=192.0s)]
*  From the MAGA bomber to the Cincinnati FBI shooter, remember that? The guy that showed up at the FBI after the indictments. The death threats, the fake emergency calls against investigators and prosecutors, just a few in the past week. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=202.0s)]
*  Judges, election officials. There has just been a constant stream of threats of violence and actual attempts at violence against people that have tried to hold Donald Trump to account. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=214.0s)]
*  The intimidation hangs over all of his endeavors is a big part of his strength. But the place where this kind of politics is the most effective, the most acutely present, is within Republican Party circles. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=223.0s)]
*  Because for people who exist in that world, inside the Republican Party, inside professional conservative politics, the harassment and threat of violence is much, much more intimate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=238.0s)]
*  There were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security, afraid, you know, in some instances for their lives. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=247.0s)]
*  Colleagues who are now traveling with armed escorts out of the fear for their safety. Many of us are altering our routines, working to get body armor. Our expectation is that someone may try to kill us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=253.0s)]
*  The threats are constant. They've increased. You know, I even heard a voicemail just this morning that we got last night threatening execution. That's kind of seems to be the normal thing nowadays was just threaten execution. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=265.0s)]
*  Again, that all happened not a long time ago. It's regrettably easy to forget now that Republicans who voted to impeach or convict Trump were, they thought at least, and I think credibly, kind of putting their lives at risk. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=279.0s)]
*  At least their family safety in themselves. Certainly their peace of mind was put at risk. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=293.0s)]
*  Do you remember this? We just learned this a few months ago. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=298.0s)]
*  Senator Mitt Romney revealed that he had to spend $5,000 a day on protective security after January 6th. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=301.0s)]
*  In fact, as he later revealed to Atlantic reporter, McCabe Coppens, in a biography of Romney, a reckoning, one Republican congressman confided to Romney he wanted to vote for Trump's second impeachment, but chose not to out of fear for his family's safety. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=307.0s)]
*  And when one senator, a member of leadership, said he was leaning towards voting to convict, the others urged him to reconsider. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=320.0s)]
*  You can't do that, Romney recalled someone saying. Think of your personal safety, said another. Think of your children. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=326.0s)]
*  The senator eventually decided they were right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=332.0s)]
*  And this extends past people that are at the upper echelons of political power, past politicians or public officials, more than just they have been subjected to this mob intimidation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=335.0s)]
*  I mean, election officials and even like writers, just people with opinions, conservative writer and Trump critic David French has recounted how they went after him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=346.0s)]
*  And individual calls and said, I'm sorry, but I've been asked by the Trump campaign to make sure that, you know, David knows that this will be really, really bad for him. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=355.0s)]
*  The assaults on my family have been overwhelming just as a writer. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=365.0s)]
*  I have a multiracial family. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=369.0s)]
*  And so they have gone after my youngest daughter in the worst way imaginable. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=371.0s)]
*  That was back in 2016. Today, French, who's still conservative, strongly staunchly conservative and also strongly staunchly empty Trump wrote in the New York Times that things are even worse. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=376.0s)]
*  Quote, eight years of bitter experience have taught us that supporting Trump degrades the character of his core supporters. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=386.0s)]
*  Never before have I seen extremism penetrate a vast American community so deeply, so completely and so comprehensively. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=392.0s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you, this is all stuff that's sort of on the record and documented for every example of this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=400.0s)]
*  There is stuff not on the record that people discuss about their security situation, which they can't talk about publicly for obvious reasons that anytime they're in the crosshairs, they're dealing with a security issue. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=405.0s)]
*  A cautious of Trump. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=416.0s)]
*  And that's particularly true for people whose life is Republican Party politics, whose constituents are conservatives and neighbors who are Trump devotees. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=419.0s)]
*  This extremism, this acceptance of coercion, of political violence or the threat thereof, of terror, of just insane harassment as a tactic, it's really powerful. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=426.0s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, I really believe this, that it has completely subverted the ability of the Republican Party themselves to genuinely run a free and fair election within their own party to choose their own nominee. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=441.0s)]
*  Because not only is there this ever present threat, you know, everyone in the upper echelons of the party also understands that Donald Trump will never accept defeat. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=454.0s)]
*  I mean, you're having a contest with a guy who, is he going to accept defeat? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=464.0s)]
*  They understand it because of January 6th, but they understand it before that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=468.0s)]
*  They understand it because of 2016 when Trump lost the Iowa caucuses and he reportedly pressured state Republicans to invalidate the results. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=471.0s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=480.0s)]
*  He ran around afterwards saying it was rigged. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=483.0s)]
*  So just take a second to imagine what it would look like if Nikki Haley or someone else actually were to start beating Donald Trump for the nomination this year. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=485.0s)]
*  If we started seeing some surprises, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=492.0s)]
*  And that has happened before in American politics. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=495.0s)]
*  It's just almost impossible not to imagine a situation in which you end up with a scene that looks like January 6th outside the Republican National Convention. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=499.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=513.0s)]
*  Like, if Trump starts losing, what's going to happen? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=514.0s)]
*  Play that out. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=517.0s)]
*  They all have. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=518.0s)]
*  They all understand what they're dealing with. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=519.0s)]
*  It is under those conditions. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=520.0s)]
*  Those are the conditions under which we are having this contest, this election for the Republican nominee. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=523.0s)]
*  Whatever happens on Monday in Iowa and later in New Hampshire and South Carolina and Super Tuesday, you just cannot separate Trump's performance from these ever-present, deeply ominous, anti-democratic threats of harassment and violence. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=529.0s)]
*  It's just a central part of what Donald Trump stands for, how he and his movement pursue political power. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=541.0s)]
*  If you have documented receipts of foreign governments writing checks or giving credit card payments to Joe Biden, show it to us. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=549.0s)]
*  We've been at this for a year now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=559.0s)]
*  We haven't seen anything. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=561.0s)]
*  Then we show you in our more than 100-page report the documented receipts of money going into Donald Trump, but you don't care about it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=562.0s)]
*  In other words, you don't care about the principle that our government leaders should not be on the take from foreign governments. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=569.0s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=576.0s)]
*  Amidst House Republicans' as yet utterly unproven and undemonstrated claims of President Joe Biden taking illicit funds, again, which they accuse he was doing not when he was president, to be clear, Congressman Jimmy Raskin and other House Democrats issued a 100-page report showing that, quote, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=577.0s)]
*  as president, Donald Trump accepted more than $7.8 million from foreign states and their leaders, including some of the world's most unsavory regimes. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=591.0s)]
*  Today, Raskin wrote a letter to Donald Trump himself. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=600.0s)]
*  Please, sir, quote, immediately return to the American people the $7,886,072 we know you've accepted from foreign governments in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=603.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Congressman Jimmy Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, and the ranking member on the Oversight Committee. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=616.0s)]
*  Congressman, we played that clip of Trump asked about it, sort of asked about it, at the sort of campaign rally he did in coordination with Fox. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=622.0s)]
*  And I mean, he doesn't deny it, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=630.0s)]
*  Like, this is not, I don't think the facts are in dispute here. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=632.0s)]
*  I don't think anyone disputes the facts as documented in your report. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=635.0s)]
*  Now, he was bragging about it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=641.0s)]
*  His narcissism always interferes with his legal defenses. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=642.0s)]
*  But he openly embraced it and said he did a lot for that money. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=646.0s)]
*  And indeed, he did. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=649.0s)]
*  If you read our report, you will see how he basically killed an investigation and sanctions against ICBC, the Chinese state-owned company that was renting space from him and paying him lots and lots of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=650.0s)]
*  You know, everybody knows the way he covered up for the homicidal crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who also was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year at Trump's hotels, golf courses and so on. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=668.0s)]
*  And of course, the big payoff came later with the $2 billion to his son-in-law, to Jared Kushner. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=681.0s)]
*  But the bottom line is there's really no defenses out there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=689.0s)]
*  I mean, his sons have said a couple of things like, well, he didn't take his federal salary. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=693.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, but that's all you're allowed to take. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=697.0s)]
*  $400,000 from American citizens, not from Saudi monarchs and Chinese government bureaucrats. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=700.0s)]
*  You know, you can't take money from United Arab Emirates and Kuwait and Qatar and all of the countries that we enumerate in our report. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=708.0s)]
*  We're talking about millions of dollars. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=715.0s)]
*  So we want it back. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=717.0s)]
*  He's not allowed to keep a dime of it without coming to Congress first. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=719.0s)]
*  He never came to Congress, and they've been covering up for this for seven years. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=723.0s)]
*  And when we finally got the Supreme Court to rule for us and then the district court to do an order, we had four months of compliance before Chairman Comer shut it down, at least according to Trump's lawyers who said he shut it down. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=728.0s)]
*  We're getting now a mixed message on that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=742.0s)]
*  Maybe Trump's lawyers lied, in which case Chairman Comer should make it very clear that Mazar's has to continue to comply. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=745.0s)]
*  In any event, we know of $7.8 million that belongs to the American people and not in Donald Trump's pockets. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=752.0s)]
*  In 1994, writer Isabel Wilkerson became the first black woman to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Journalism for a feature article she wrote in the New York Times on a 10-year-old black boy on Chicago's South Side and her coverage of the 1993 Midwestern floods. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=759.0s)]
*  Nearly 20 years later, in 2010, she wrote The Warmth of Other Suns, an instant classic, won a whole bunch of awards. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=773.0s)]
*  It's about the black migration north through much of the 20th century, an incredible book. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=780.0s)]
*  Can't recommend it highly enough. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=784.0s)]
*  Then in 2020, she followed that up with Caste, The Origins Are Discontents, an epic exploration of the nature of not just American racial hierarchy, but hierarchy across the world over spans of time and place. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=786.0s)]
*  And I was lucky enough to talk to her about her hopes for the book on my podcast, Why Does This Happen? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=798.0s)]
*  This actually is not an argument. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=805.0s)]
*  This is an invitation to look at ourselves differently, an invitation to understanding what we might not have seen or known about ourselves before. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=808.0s)]
*  In fact, could not have known because these things are not taught, the connections have not been made, and this is an attempt to make connections that otherwise we would not see. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=818.0s)]
*  So that's how I look at it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=827.0s)]
*  And it's filled with stories to allow a person to be able to see for oneself what I'm presenting. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=829.0s)]
*  And then an amazing turn of events, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Ava DuVernay got the rights to the book, Caste. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=839.0s)]
*  And then rather than make a documentary or a series like her 13th for Netflix, about the 13th Amendment, she's produced an original feature film titled Origin that sort of tracks the story of Wilkerson writing the book. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=845.0s)]
*  In her lace with its themes. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=856.0s)]
*  Slavery lasted 246 years. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=859.0s)]
*  That's 13 generations of people. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=863.0s)]
*  Plus another 100 years of Jim Crow segregation, violence and murder. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=866.0s)]
*  It is, of course, horrific. I am not downplaying any of it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=872.0s)]
*  There were so many millions of African Americans who were murdered. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=875.0s)]
*  From the middle passage until the end of legal segregation, that it goes beyond the realm of an official number. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=883.0s)]
*  There is no number. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=895.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=897.0s)]
*  Stunning. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=899.0s)]
*  Origins are getting Oscar buzz and rave reviews from everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Lin-Manuel Miranda is set for wide release next week, January 19th. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=901.0s)]
*  And Ava DuVernay, the writer, director and producer of the film joins me now. Great to have you here. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=909.0s)]
*  Happy to be here. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=913.0s)]
*  What a phenomenal film that I got to watch today that's I would say very almost unlike any other thing I've seen. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=915.0s)]
*  I want to start with occasionally I will hear news in Hollywood that so and so is making a film out of this thing. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=920.0s)]
*  There's two that I thought of. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=927.0s)]
*  The big short when Adam McKay was going to make sure. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=929.0s)]
*  I was like how are you going to make that? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=931.0s)]
*  And Barbie, I was like how are you going to make that? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=933.0s)]
*  And Cass, which I had read, I was like how are you going to make that into a movie? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=935.0s)]
*  How did you conceptualize it? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=937.0s)]
*  Well, that's the beautiful thing about film and about creativity. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=939.0s)]
*  We can figure it out when everyone says how do you do it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=941.0s)]
*  And on this one, you know, this is an anthropological thesis, truly. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=943.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a call to action in many ways. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=947.0s)]
*  But it's facts, it's figures, it's some anecdotes that have a few characters here and there. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=951.0s)]
*  But not a story in the sense of I can adapt a beginning, middle and end. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=954.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=958.0s)]
*  So I was hunting for the way in. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=959.0s)]
*  I know I didn't want to make a documentary. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=962.0s)]
*  Documentaries are what I use to convey information. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=964.0s)]
*  I wanted people to feel emotion and empathy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=966.0s)]
*  And so the best way to do that is with actors. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=969.0s)]
*  So I started searching for characters in the book. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=971.0s)]
*  I thought maybe I'll make it like Crash, you know, that film, Interlocking Stories. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=973.0s)]
*  I was trying to think of all the ways to do it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=977.0s)]
*  And then Isabel started to rise from the pages because occasionally she'll use first person. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=979.0s)]
*  To describe her research and what she's doing to put these pieces together. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=983.0s)]
*  So I started to look in the places where she said I did this, my journey here and started to think, wow, what if she guided us through? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=987.0s)]
*  And what I love about it is that the story ends up becoming her putting the pieces together in some ways. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=993.0s)]
*  I was sort of emerging from a wreckage of a whole bunch of personal tragedy she went through. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=997.0s)]
*  And then it kind of interweaves. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1002.0s)]
*  So you sort of transport from Nazi Germany to India, to her, you know, her vision of it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1004.0s)]
*  The other question I have was like how you got the film made? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1011.0s)]
*  Because again, like you're like, oh, I have cast, right? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1014.0s)]
*  This is like it's not the hot studio pitch. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1017.0s)]
*  It's not the studio pitch. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1019.0s)]
*  It's not like it's not transparent. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1020.0s)]
*  No, it's no cape. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1022.0s)]
*  No one's in a cape. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1023.0s)]
*  There's no superhero. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1024.0s)]
*  Exactly. But there is a superhero. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1025.0s)]
*  She is sort of. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1026.0s)]
*  She is a superhero. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1027.0s)]
*  Anjanu Ellis-Taylor, who is the outstanding lead in this film. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1028.0s)]
*  She does a remarkable job. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1031.0s)]
*  She's incredible. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1032.0s)]
*  She said that she felt like an intellectual Indiana Jones. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1034.0s)]
*  Yeah, it has that right. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1036.0s)]
*  It's like a caper. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1037.0s)]
*  Yeah, a bit of it because it's with globe shotting. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1038.0s)]
*  We shot this film in, you know, 37 days in three continents on three continents. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1041.0s)]
*  And so we're moving around the world, moving around time. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1045.0s)]
*  And that is not the real viable pitch for studios. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1048.0s)]
*  I want to make a film about cast. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1053.0s)]
*  And so we just bypassed that. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1055.0s)]
*  You know, we didn't do a whole bunch of studio pitches. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1058.0s)]
*  We just started to think of who were like-minded individuals, organizations that were interested in this kind of fare. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1060.0s)]
*  And we came up with a few places like the Ford Foundation. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1067.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Ford Foundation. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1072.0s)]
*  And Melinda Gates and Lorene Powell Jobs and like-minded folks that are interested in this. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1073.0s)]
*  It's awesome because it looks and has a feel, the aesthetics of like a big film. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1078.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1082.0s)]
*  It's a big film made by philanthropists. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1083.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1085.0s)]
*  You know, the thing that I, the sort of unlocking moment in that book, which I read and I had, Wilkerson, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1086.0s)]
*  is the sort of notion of we tend to think in narrow terms about racial hierarchy in the U.S. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1093.0s)]
*  and the experience of slavery for obvious reasons. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1098.0s)]
*  But the experience of hierarchy according to cast is a much broader and global phenomenon through times and space and different history. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1100.0s)]
*  What do you want people, that to me was the kind of like key juxtaposition I walked away. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1107.0s)]
*  How do you think about this hitting your audience? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1112.0s)]
*  I just think, you know, the knowledge of the interlocking kind of connective tissue between oppressions, subjugations, you know, environments where folks are degraded and demeaned. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1115.0s)]
*  The reason why there's so much pain around those issues is because you feel isolated. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1128.0s)]
*  You know, I know African Americans feel like no one understands, you know, you know, Dullet people feel like they're in a very unique position. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1134.0s)]
*  Jewish people as it relates to the Holocaust feel, you know, very isolated from what I've heard in terms of folks really understanding the pain. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1142.0s)]
*  All of our pains are so specific. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1150.0s)]
*  And yes, there's yet there's a universality to it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1152.0s)]
*  If you understand that there's something underneath connecting it, it makes you feel a bit less alone. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1154.0s)]
*  That's how I feel when I read the book, that I'm connected to these people through this social phenomena. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1159.0s)]
*  And it provided a bit of, I don't know, it had a liberating quality. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1165.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the things that struck me about the book and this comes up in the movie as well is the idea that like when you are presented with another society's caste system, it seems ludicrous on its face. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1171.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1185.0s)]
*  Where someone says like, oh, those are, we call them untouchable. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1186.0s)]
*  And you're like, why? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1189.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1190.0s)]
*  When you're in your own version of it, like you're so acculturated to it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1191.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1195.0s)]
*  And so the sort of transport across these different boundaries allows you to kind of like step outside your own society. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1196.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's an empathy machine. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1202.0s)]
*  But also, I mean, shocking. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1203.0s)]
*  I had no clue. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1204.0s)]
*  And I'm an African-American studies major, have a degree in African-American studies. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1206.0s)]
*  I had never heard about the fact that, you know, that American segregation and miscegenation laws were the blueprint for non-breed protocols. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1210.0s)]
*  That's not something that is widely taught. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1220.0s)]
*  I remember reading that in the book and having my mind blown. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1223.0s)]
*  And so we explore that moment in the film where she puts those pieces together. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1225.0s)]
*  We explore, you know, how the Trayvon Martin case was really the catalyst for her to start thinking about, wait, everyone's calling this race. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1229.0s)]
*  But there's something else going on here. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1237.0s)]
*  It's a Latino man who stalks and kills a black boy to protect an all-white neighborhood. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1240.0s)]
*  Does that feel neatly in the box of race? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1245.0s)]
*  There's something else. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1248.0s)]
*  So in just being with her and watching her investigate, explore, and kind of peel back the layers of the mystery, you learn along the way. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BOQwRQXLg&t=1249.0s)]
