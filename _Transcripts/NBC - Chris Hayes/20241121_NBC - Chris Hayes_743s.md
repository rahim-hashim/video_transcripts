# Sen. Duckworth: I’d be worried about Hegseth ‘running a McDonalds,’ let alone the Pentagon
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q)
*  The second day in a row, Senator JD Vance, the vice president-elect, spent the day chaperoning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  an unqualified man seriously accused of sex crimes around the Capitol. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=5.2s)]
*  Two days in a row. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=9.24s)]
*  Asking senators to look past it all and vote for the guy to take one of the most powerful [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=10.44s)]
*  jobs in the entire world. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=13.72s)]
*  Yesterday, Vance accompanied Matt Gaetz and tried to sell fellow Republican senators on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=16.72s)]
*  his bid to be attorney general. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=21.36s)]
*  And as we were just reporting, that didn't go so well. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=23.44s)]
*  Today, Vance was doing the same for Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to be secretary [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=25.76s)]
*  of defense. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=31.28s)]
*  In fact, it was outside Vance's Senate office that Hegseth gave this very lawyerly response [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=32.28s)]
*  to a reporter asking about the latest troubling allegations against him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=37.24s)]
*  As far as the media is concerned, it's very simple. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=41.8s)]
*  The matter was fully investigated and that was completely clear. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  You'll be shocked to learn it isn't quite that simple. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=55.6s)]
*  Hegseth has not been charged, but he wasn't completely cleared in his words. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=58.68s)]
*  In fact, the allegations are as serious as they come. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  In 2017, the allegation is Hegseth sexually assaulted a woman. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=64.84s)]
*  He met at a political conference he spoke at in California for Republican women. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=69.72s)]
*  This is a conference that, you know, fellow conservatives, fellow Republicans. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=73.36s)]
*  Now, those allegations first came to light last week after the Washington Post obtained [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=76.2s)]
*  written by a friend of the accuser and sent to the Trump transition team to alert them [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=81.54s)]
*  of the case. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  Like, heads up here, guys. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  The memo sent to the Trump team said that the woman identified in the memo only as Jane [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=90.26s)]
*  Doe was there with the California Federation of Republican Women. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=95.06s)]
*  The woman was staying at the hotel with her small children and her husband, according [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=99.22s)]
*  to the memo, which laid out the woman's complaint. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  The Trump team did not even know about the allegation before Hegseth was announced as [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=107.46s)]
*  the Pentagon nominee, according to the Post. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=111.13999999999999s)]
*  But since then, Hegseth's attorney has said in a statement that the nominee did in fact [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=114.17999999999999s)]
*  have sex with the 30-year-old married conservative staffer, but that it was consensual. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=117.82s)]
*  And he added that Hegseth paid the woman an undisclosed amount as part of a non-disclosure [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=123.58s)]
*  agreement because he feared that revelation of the matter would result in his immediate [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=128.22s)]
*  termination from Fox. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=132.04s)]
*  Hegseth did not get an NDA, however, with the Monterey, California, city attorney's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=134.78s)]
*  office, and while they pressed no charges against him, they did provide reporters with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=138.62s)]
*  a 22-page police report on the incident. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=142.78s)]
*  That complaint originated with an emergency room nurse who was required to report the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=147.3s)]
*  incident to police after the accuser went to the hospital to request a sexual assault [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=153.8s)]
*  examination. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=160.18s)]
*  And the details in that complaint are upsetting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=162.26s)]
*  The accuser, who's called Jane Doe on the report, was socializing with other women at [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=165.06s)]
*  the conference when Hegseth joined them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  She quote, stated she observed Hegseth acting inappropriately with the women at the conference. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=170.98s)]
*  Hegseth rubbed the women on their legs, and Jane Doe thought his actions were inappropriate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=176.22s)]
*  In fact, the accuser had texted an unnamed friend quote that Hegseth was giving off a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  creeper vibe. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  The woman said she remembered walking out of the bar and assumed Hegseth followed her [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=187.42s)]
*  because she argued with Hegseth near the pool. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=191.06s)]
*  The argument was about Hegseth's actions with the women at the conference. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  At that point, she remembered Hegseth telling her that he was a nice guy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=198.17999999999998s)]
*  She said quote, the next memory she had was when she was in an unknown room. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=202.33999999999997s)]
*  Jane Doe did not know where she was and how she got to the room. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  Hegseth was in the room with her. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=210.78s)]
*  She said she got up and tried to leave the room, but Hegseth blocked the door with his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  body. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=216.5s)]
*  Jane Doe remembered saying no a lot. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=217.58s)]
*  The report then details the woman's recollection of being underneath him as he sexually assaulted [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=221.06s)]
*  her. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=226.14s)]
*  I'm not going to read you that part of the report, but according to her account, Hegseth's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=227.14s)]
*  dog tags from his military service were hovering over her face. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=230.66s)]
*  Now again, Hegseth denies all this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=234.1s)]
*  He says they had consensual sex. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=236.7s)]
*  He's even suggested that the woman was the aggressor in this encounter. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=240.02s)]
*  Hegseth clearly knows what a liability this story is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=244.9s)]
*  There's a police report, an accusation of sexual assault, a woman going to a hospital. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=247.5s)]
*  And he knows it because he literally paid for it to go away to preserve his job on the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=253.46s)]
*  Fox and Friends couch. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=256.38s)]
*  The Trump team was reportedly completely blindsided by the allegations and then blindsided again [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=259.14s)]
*  by the police report. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=264.9s)]
*  People familiar with the discussions told the Wall Street Journal today that Trump's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  transition team did not know that Hegseth had gotten a copy of that police report, something [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=270.86s)]
*  he apparently hadn't told them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=275.18s)]
*  They did not know this about the guy Trump picked to run the entire United States Department [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=278.06s)]
*  of Defense, largest employer in America, one of the largest bureaucracies in human history. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=282.54s)]
*  What else didn't they know? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=288.86s)]
*  But here's the thing, as with Matt Gaetz, putting all of this beside, even before these [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=291.18s)]
*  allegations came out, because Hegseth was manifestly unqualified to manage the Pentagon [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=295.5s)]
*  and its nearly three million civilian and military employees. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=300.3s)]
*  A man who's never run anything bigger than a right-wing astroturf veterans group funded [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=303.5s)]
*  by the Koch brothers, a man who was removed from the security detail protecting Joe Biden's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  inauguration and ultimately left the National Guard after the D.C. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=310.94s)]
*  Guard's head of physical security flagged Hegseth as a potential insider threat, setting [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  a tattoo of Hegseth as a symbol common among white supremacists and militant groups. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=319.34s)]
*  Hegseth says it's merely a Christian tattoo. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=324.94s)]
*  This week, a military official familiar with Hegseth's service in the D.C. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=328.34s)]
*  Guard told NBC News that, quote, he had zero leadership capability. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  He had his own agenda. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=336.02s)]
*  He didn't care what the rules were. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=337.14s)]
*  He didn't care what the parameters were. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=338.58s)]
*  He was just doing what he needed to get ahead. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  Senator Tammy Duckworth is a Democrat from Illinois who served on the Armed Services [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=344.38s)]
*  Committee. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  She's an Iraq war veteran and Purple Heart recipient, and she joins me now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  Senator, first, I want to start on some of the revelations around these allegations, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=352.17999999999995s)]
*  which I think both speak to character, clearly, if they're true, and he denies them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=356.74s)]
*  But also, there's an institutional issue here with how the Department of Defense deals with [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=361.62s)]
*  such accusations and injustice in those cases. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=365.42s)]
*  What is your reaction to what's been reported so far about the allegations against Mr. Hegseth? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=369.54s)]
*  I mean, it's insane. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=375.86s)]
*  He already was manifestly unqualified to be Secretary of Defense, but it's insane that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump wants this man who admits, as you said, he paid off a woman who accused [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=382.9s)]
*  him of rape to lead the Department of Defense. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=389.06s)]
*  Remember now, we've been working for over a decade on military sexual trauma, getting [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=391.06s)]
*  to finally a place where the military is doing better. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=397.02s)]
*  And it is really a slap in the face of the men and women who wear the uniform of this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=400.29999999999995s)]
*  great nation should this man be confirmed to be Secretary of Defense, not just because [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=404.97999999999996s)]
*  he's unqualified, but these sexual assault allegations are something that's going to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=410.82s)]
*  give a lot of people pause. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=415.54s)]
*  And let me tell you, if I'm, you know, if my girls are six and 10 now, but, you know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=416.82s)]
*  if they were to come to me at 18 and say, hey, I want to go join the military, I'd think [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=422.58s)]
*  twice if that's who the Secretary of Defense is. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=426.78s)]
*  Speaking of them joining the military, he has some pretty sharp views on the role of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=429.7s)]
*  women in the armed forces, particularly women in combat. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=436.1s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen this clip. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure it played for you, but I'm going to play it again for the audience. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=440.70000000000005s)]
*  This is him speaking on a podcast about his views on women in combat. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=442.94s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  You got to fire. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  You got to fire the chairman, joint chiefs and you got to fire this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=450.26000000000005s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you can bring in a new secretary of defense, but any general that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=452.74s)]
*  was involved, general admiral, whatever that was involved in any of the DEI woke, it's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=455.62s)]
*  got to go. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=460.34000000000003s)]
*  You don't like women in combat. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=461.1s)]
*  No, I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=462.5s)]
*  Obviously, you served in combat quite famously. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=466.98s)]
*  I think I know where you stand on this, but what does it mean for the institution to have [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=472.54s)]
*  a secretary of defense on the record saying that? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=476.62s)]
*  What it means is you have a secretary of defense who does not understand modern warfare. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=480.14000000000004s)]
*  This is not the Revolutionary War. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=483.74s)]
*  This isn't even like Vietnam where you have front lines. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  The most casualties we took in Iraq was during convoy operations. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=489.54s)]
*  Over 50 percent of our casualties in Iraq was during performing convoy operations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=494.3s)]
*  Driving a truck is a job that women have been doing since World War I. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=498.9s)]
*  If you were in the green zone in Baghdad, doing, you know, if you were a cook in the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=502.82s)]
*  green zone, you were in combat. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=507.18s)]
*  You took incoming missile fire all the time. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=508.62s)]
*  And so this just shows us not only is it a morale issue, but it's the fact that he doesn't [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=511.82s)]
*  understand modern warfare. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=515.62s)]
*  If he thinks that there's a way to keep women out of combat, not to mention that there are [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=516.62s)]
*  over 200,000 women serving in uniform today in the military. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=520.62s)]
*  We couldn't go to war without our women. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=524.14s)]
*  So it really just points to how deeply unqualified he is to lead the Department of Defense. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=526.78s)]
*  You know, it also strikes me, I mean, again, aside from his views, aside from the allegations, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=532.26s)]
*  just purely on experience. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=536.22s)]
*  Like I can think of, I mean, a lot of folks that I know that are very, very sharp and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=539.8199999999999s)]
*  who have served, I wouldn't necessarily say they should run the Department of Defense. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=543.6999999999999s)]
*  the largest, basically the largest entity you could run anywhere in the U.S. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=548.98s)]
*  And I guess, you know, what do you think the qualifications are, affirmatively, like that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=555.34s)]
*  he lacks? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=559.46s)]
*  You know, obviously past secretaries have been people who have had some experience basically [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=560.46s)]
*  managing large bureaucracies. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=564.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was a platoon leader, which is 35 guys. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=566.66s)]
*  We're talking about going from managing 35 people to 3 million people with a budget in [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=572.7s)]
*  this year's NDA's budget is $923 billion. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=579.38s)]
*  Pretty high. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=583.74s)]
*  Pretty high. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=585.46s)]
*  You can't just put the, you know, anybody to go do that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=586.86s)]
*  I would be worried about Hexbeth running a McDonald's, something, you know, let alone [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=589.9000000000001s)]
*  the Department of Defense. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=594.82s)]
*  This is absolutely insane. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=596.5400000000001s)]
*  My question is for him. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=598.0200000000001s)]
*  You talked about advice and consent. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=599.0200000000001s)]
*  When he comes in front of me as part of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it's going [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=600.66s)]
*  to be focused on what experience do you have? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=603.74s)]
*  Have you done logistics? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=606.54s)]
*  Do you understand how to do supply chain? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=607.54s)]
*  Do you understand manufacturing? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=609.22s)]
*  What do you know about targeting? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  What do you know about battalion, division, army operations? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=612.74s)]
*  And he's not going to answer any of that because he operated at such a low level and he has [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=618.86s)]
*  no experience even in the civilian world. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=623.54s)]
*  You know, it's not like he's been CEO of a major corporation. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=625.58s)]
*  He's done none of that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=627.78s)]
*  And we're going to entrust this man with the lives of the most patriotic, heroic Americans [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  we have, the men and women who wear the uniform of this great nation. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=634.54s)]
*  It would be malpractice and it would be a crime to confirm this man to be Secretary of Defense. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=637.5799999999999s)]
*  I want to just show, you know, so today Matt Gaetz, who I think a lot of people on Capitol [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=643.0999999999999s)]
*  Hill across the ideological spectrum thought was a poor choice to be attorney general of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=647.0999999999999s)]
*  the United States. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=651.0999999999999s)]
*  And there are many people on both sides of the aisle, particularly Republicans, who hold [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=652.54s)]
*  him in ill will. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=656.42s)]
*  There were basically at least five no votes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=659.38s)]
*  Susan Collins, the new senator-elect, John Curtis, who was replacing Mitt Romney, comes [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=661.9s)]
*  out of Utah. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=666.3399999999999s)]
*  Mitch McConnell, of course. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=667.3399999999999s)]
*  Mark-Wayne Mullen, who quite famously went on that long rant about essentially what a [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=668.3399999999999s)]
*  scumbag he thought Matt Gaetz was. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=672.86s)]
*  And Lisa Murakowski. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  I guess my question to you is, where do you see this right now? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=675.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think this is for you, this is pretty existential. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=679.0999999999999s)]
*  This is a person who just has no business having this job. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=681.78s)]
*  He doesn't quite have the same reputation on Capitol Hill because Matt Gaetz is a singular [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=685.94s)]
*  entity. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=692.1s)]
*  But where do you think this stands? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=693.3800000000001s)]
*  Well, let me say this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=695.46s)]
*  As the mom of two young girls, as I said, ages six and 10, I don't think Hexbeth could [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=697.3800000000001s)]
*  pass a background check to be a babysitter, let alone pass a background check to be Secretary [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=701.7800000000001s)]
*  of Defense, especially since he has admitted to paying off an accuser who accuses him of [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=706.74s)]
*  sexual assault. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=713.6600000000001s)]
*  Would you want to put this man in charge of taking care of your kids, let alone three [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=714.78s)]
*  million personnel in the Department of Defense? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=718.74s)]
*  I think not. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPf0zIRef2Q&t=721.86s)]
