# Republicans find scapegoat for auto workers strike: Woke cars
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc)
*  So Donald Trump has made his counter-programming plan for next week's second Republican debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=0.0s)]
*  He's going to head to Detroit, where he's going to deliver a speech in front of hundreds [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=6.04s)]
*  of autoworkers who, of course, remain on strike from the nation's three biggest manufacturers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=9.36s)]
*  It is a notable play for the frontrunner of the Republican nomination because for the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  better part of the last century, the Republican Party has been the party of the bosses. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=19.88s)]
*  It's the party of management over labor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=24.92s)]
*  It's a core, core part of the identity, a central Republican belief. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=27.0s)]
*  For decades, decades, it has been the case if you elect a Republican president, you will [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=32.68s)]
*  get a federal government that is much more hostile to organized labor. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  And crucially, this is important, this was also true under the last Republican president, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=41.32s)]
*  a guy by the name of Donald Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=47.2s)]
*  Donald Trump appointed anti-labor members to the National Labor Relations Board. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=49.8s)]
*  He chose Eugene Scalia, son of conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=54.0s)]
*  longtime corporate lawyer, to lead the Department of Labor. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=58.88s)]
*  He elevated anti-worker judges to the federal courts, who consistently have been ruling [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=62.58s)]
*  against labor in their perches on the bench. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=66.76s)]
*  Now Donald Trump and his party of bosses have a bit of a political problem. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=70.2s)]
*  You see, something is happening in America. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=75.4s)]
*  We are witnessing an enormous resurgence of pro-labor enthusiasm. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=77.92s)]
*  Nearly 70% of Americans support labor unions, a number that has been steadily rising for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=82.36s)]
*  the past decade. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=88.32s)]
*  75% of Americans, 75% say they side with the autoworkers in their current dispute. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=89.8s)]
*  So when you look at those poll numbers, what is a Republican to do in the face of that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=96.56s)]
*  clear public opinion and a strike with no end in sight? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=100.84s)]
*  Now some, like presidential hopefuls Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, notably both from one [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=104.48s)]
*  of the most anti-union states in the country, South Carolina, are sticking to the old party [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=109.54s)]
*  line. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  You almost have to respect it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  Scott even suggested firing workers who go on strike. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=117.06s)]
*  But the more sophisticated political operators have managed to reverse engineer a perfect [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=121.14s)]
*  scapegoat for the whole situation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=127.94000000000001s)]
*  Woke cars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  I think the workers are right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  They need higher wages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=134.18s)]
*  And importantly, we need to stop the premature push to electric vehicles that's putting a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=135.82s)]
*  lot of Ohio autoworkers out of a job. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=139.66s)]
*  I guarantee you that one of the things that's driving that strike is that the Bidenomics [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=141.9s)]
*  and their green energy electric vehicle agenda is good for Beijing and bad for Detroit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  They want to destroy the autoworkers in this country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=155.9s)]
*  They want to have cars made all electric. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  They're all going to be made within three years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=161.22s)]
*  They're all going to be made in China. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=163.18s)]
*  The electric vehicles are the problem, not the corporations, the bosses, or the record [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  profits not translating to record contracts or the two tier system put in when Detroit [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=169.38s)]
*  was flat on its back and the American people rescued them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=174.66s)]
*  No, it's the woke environmental agenda. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  It's the electric cars, which of course we need for the future to mitigate the biggest [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=179.62s)]
*  civilizational threat we've ever met. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=183.18s)]
*  This line is a great way for Republicans to avoid sounding like the anti-union bosses [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=186.58s)]
*  lackeys that they in fact are. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=192.22s)]
*  And they are helped by the fact it does contain a kernel of truth. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=194.78s)]
*  There's a lot of anxiety among the autoworkers union about the transition to electric, especially [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=197.54s)]
*  with the country's biggest electric automaker, Tesla, not being unionized. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=202.38s)]
*  Would be great if it was unionized. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=207.26s)]
*  I'm not sure Donald Trump would support that one. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=209.1s)]
*  Now you can be sure that Donald Trump will harp on electric vehicles again in Detroit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=212.14s)]
*  when he speaks in front of the striking autoworkers next week. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=216.46s)]
*  And it will be a real test of the political press. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=219.54s)]
*  Will they just focus on the optics, Donald Trump courts union voters, or will they dig [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=225.14s)]
*  into the actual substance of Trump's actual record on labor when he was actually the president [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=231.38s)]
*  of the United States, as well as the record of his party versus that of President Joe [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=237.82s)]
*  Biden, a president who's filled the national labor relations board with some of the most [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=243.54s)]
*  pro-labor appointees in memory? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=248.18s)]
*  Now I have to say, this is exactly what Politico just did, meeting the test when they followed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=250.34s)]
*  up on a story about the optics of Trump's speech with this piece about his clear and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=254.9s)]
*  consistent anti-labor record in office. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=260.42s)]
*  Kudos to Politico for that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=264.42s)]
*  But this is a key test a whole lot of outlets failed in 2016. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=267.22s)]
*  And if we do not want that to happen again, we cannot just report on what Donald Trump [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=272.1s)]
*  says on its face. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=276.06s)]
*  Donald Trump was the president of the United States. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=278.5s)]
*  In that position, he wielded real power. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=280.5s)]
*  He has a substantive record beneath his words, and everyone has a responsibility to tell [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=282.94s)]
*  the full truth about that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqWkYQZ-QWc&t=287.78000000000003s)]
