# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights June 23
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. A lot going on on this Friday night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we have some big developments in both of special counsel Jack Smith's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=3.6s)]
*  investigations into Donald Trump. First in the documents case just minutes ago [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=7.68s)]
*  we learned that Smith has filed three motions. He's asked that the ex-president's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  trial date originally set for this August be delayed until December 11th of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=17.12s)]
*  this year. That is to give the government more time to address procedures involving [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=22.32s)]
*  the classified documents that are crucial to the prosecution's argument. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=26.84s)]
*  Smith also requested a pre-trial conference regarding those classified [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=30.52s)]
*  documents and submitted a sealed list of witnesses that Donald Trump and his [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=35.32s)]
*  co-defendant Walt Notta are not allowed to speak to personally per the terms of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=39.68s)]
*  their release before trial. We're also looking at a major development in Jack [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=45.24s)]
*  Smith's other case related to January 6th. Specifically the so-called fake [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=49.68s)]
*  electors scheme which was one of many attempts by Trump and his allies to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=54.96s)]
*  overturn the results of the 2020 election. NBC News has previously reported [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=58.8s)]
*  that two of the fake electors from Nevada testified before Jack Smith's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  federal grand jury earlier this month. Now that detail alone is pretty telling. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=67.52s)]
*  Indicated that Smith and his team are actively pursuing the fake electors as [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=72.12s)]
*  part of a larger investigation into Donald Trump's unlawful attempts to stay [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=75.72s)]
*  in power after he lost the election. But a new twist today, a brand new report out [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=80.68s)]
*  now reveals these two fake electors who testified were offered partial immunity [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=85.4s)]
*  as part of their cooperation with the investigation which certainly signals an [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=91.28s)]
*  escalation in this portion of the inquiry. Now to explain why we should [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  first look at the bigger picture of the whole fake electors scheme and I gotta [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=100.68s)]
*  say there were so many parallel efforts to overturn the election and keep Donald [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump in power unlawfully against the will of the American people it can be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=110.32s)]
*  difficult to keep track of them all. So in order to understand the fake electors [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=113.72s)]
*  scheme you need to be familiar with some technical stuff about how the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  electoral college works. Here is how congressman Adam Schiff explained it [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  during one of the January 6 hearings. Under our Constitution when we cast our [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  votes for president we are actually voting to send electors pledged to our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=131.28s)]
*  preferred candidate to the electoral college. In December the electors in each [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=135.48s)]
*  state meet cast their votes and send those votes to Washington. There is only [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=140.28s)]
*  one legitimate slate of electors from each state. On the sixth day of January [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=144.84s)]
*  Congress meets in a joint session to count those votes and the winner of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=149.64s)]
*  electoral college vote becomes the president. So it's a weird process I [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=153.56s)]
*  think we should get rid of it but it's what we got right so for example in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=157.76s)]
*  2020 when Joe Biden won the state of Nevada for instance and it's six [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=160.96s)]
*  electoral votes the state's six Biden electors got together in December [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=165.24s)]
*  and they certified Joe Biden's victory. Democrat Joe Biden now officially has [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=170.16s)]
*  Nevada's six electoral college votes. This morning Nevada's electors met [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=176.52s)]
*  virtually as you see here to complete the process. Electors cast their ballots [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=180.56s)]
*  you see there they held them up so they could be seen by everybody watching. It's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=185.12s)]
*  all a constitutional process and it's taking place today all across the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=188.84s)]
*  country. Remember it was COVID so they're meeting via zoom right but when those [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  real electors were finished telling they then submitted that document you see on [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  your screen with the signatures right they all signed it attesting that Joe [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=200.28s)]
*  Biden and Kamala Harris won their state's six electoral college votes. Now [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=203.88s)]
*  this happens in some form or another in all 50 states or at least that is what [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  is supposed to happen but Trump and his allies had other plans. Now among their [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  many schemes to overturn the results the election one in which they would one [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  was one in which they would promote fake Trump electors in seven states he [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=223.0s)]
*  actually lost and for each of these seven states the fake Trump electors got [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=227.32s)]
*  together and kind of did their own like pretend version of the real thing. They [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=233.12s)]
*  signed their own fake attestation declaring falsely that Donald Trump and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=238.04s)]
*  not Biden won their state. The plan was to then submit these fake electors to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=244.52s)]
*  Mike Pence on January 6 where he had a few different options right. He could [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=250.28s)]
*  either accept the fake Trump electors instead of the real ones and just [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=254.6s)]
*  declare Trump the winner or he could say oh well you know there's a there's a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=257.6s)]
*  conflict here really who's to say and set aside both the real and the fake [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=261.76s)]
*  electors in those seven states and then declare Trump the winner. The official [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=267.24s)]
*  Nevada GOP account actually tweeted out a picture of their state's fake [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=271.88s)]
*  electors ceremony. Here is the fake document they put together. I mean it's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=276.68s)]
*  a real document but it's fake and what it says received by the U.S. National [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=281.08s)]
*  Archives actually mailed it to the archives in that document they attest [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=285.64s)]
*  that they and not those folks you saw on the zoom call a moment ago are the real [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=289.52s)]
*  electors for the state of Nevada and that they are submitting their six [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=293.84s)]
*  electoral votes for Trump not by was that true. It was not. So it should be [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=297.56s)]
*  obvious to anyone paying attention. This scheme was at the very best legally [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=304.92s)]
*  dubious. I mean you can't swear on a piece of paper to miss and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=310.56s)]
*  misrepresent yourself to the government as electoral college elector when you [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=315.64s)]
*  are not an electoral college elector and it seems like some of the fake [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=319.24s)]
*  electors actually knew that too. Listen this two slates of the fake electors [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=322.88s)]
*  the ones from Pennsylvania New Mexico they were actually smart enough to hedge [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=327.88s)]
*  their bets. Both groups added caveats to their fake documents attesting they are [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=332.04s)]
*  only going to represent themselves as Trump electors if the results of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=337.96s)]
*  election were overturned in their respective states. As the New Mexico fake [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=341.96s)]
*  electors put it we the undersigned on the understanding it might later be [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=346.24s)]
*  determined that we are the duly elected and qualified electors for president [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=350.2s)]
*  vice president etc etc. Right. See what they did there. They're like this seems [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=354.08s)]
*  dodgy but like if you know it turns out then like use us but not if not the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=359.12s)]
*  other five fake slates of electors including Nevada did not do that however [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=364.96s)]
*  they just said were the real deal and it's not just the fake electors who [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=370.64s)]
*  likely knew what they were doing was wrong. This was very much a top down [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=374.12s)]
*  effort which brings us to this truly amazing email exchange between an [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=378.36s)]
*  attorney helping the fake electors in Arizona and Trump adviser Boris Epstein [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=383.52s)]
*  in December 2020 the lawyer for the fake electors rights and I quote him here [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=387.88s)]
*  we would just be sending in fake electoral votes to pence so that someone [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  in Congress can make an objection when they start counting votes and start [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=396.64s)]
*  arguing that the fake votes should be counted and then he catches himself and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  sends a follow up email saying following alternative votes. It's probably [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=404.23999999999995s)]
*  a better term than fake votes adding a smiley face emoji. I say it bro. It's not [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  just Trump allies who are pulling the strings here and this is really crucial. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=414.84s)]
*  There is evidence that Trump himself was in on the fake electors scheme. That [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  brings us back to today's news. One of the fake electors who has apparently [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  received immunity is this guy. He's the Nevada party chair Michael McDonald. We [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=428.12s)]
*  saw him outside the courthouse in D.C. actually on the day that Trump was being [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=431.67999999999995s)]
*  arrayed in Miami and he's already had his phone seized by the feds a year ago. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  He's also turned over his text messages to the January 6 committee text which [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=440.2s)]
*  reveal that McDonald says he was in direct contact with Donald Trump himself [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=444.0s)]
*  when plotting the fake electors scam. No cut outs no intermediaries. Quote we are [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=450.36s)]
*  on it. I have been on the phone this morning with the president Eric Trump [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=454.96s)]
*  Mark Meadows and Mayor Giuliani. There is a major plan. Quote was on the phone [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=459.44s)]
*  to president Mark Meadows Giuliani and they want full attack mode. So the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=464.2s)]
*  reason this fake electors scheme is so important from the perspective of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=469.64s)]
*  prosecutor looking into January 6 is that when it comes to the upper echelons [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=472.4s)]
*  of people that were directing this attempted coup White House Chief of Staff [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  Mark Meadows Rudy Giuliani of course Trump himself. There are frankly a lot [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  of thorny legal questions about what you can prove and what's actually legal or [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=484.88s)]
*  not was Trump's big lie. Constitutionally protected speech. What about his [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=489.56s)]
*  remarks inciting the mob on January 6 where his attempts to overturn the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  election by pressuring Pence unlawful or simply corrupt and anti-democratic. I'm [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=496.44s)]
*  not a lawyer. I don't have answers to those questions. Fake electors scheme. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=502.0s)]
*  Well that seems different. In some ways it reminds me of the Trump documents [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=506.88s)]
*  case. I mean we know Trump had the documents. We know Trump shouldn't have [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=510.8s)]
*  had the documents. We know Trump didn't give the documents back when asked and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=515.08s)]
*  he was caught red handed when the FBI searched him. The fake electors scheme [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=518.8s)]
*  from the perspective of prosecutor is similar in that there's a lot of just [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=523.84s)]
*  indisputable evidence. These electors fraudulently signed documents claiming [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=526.96s)]
*  they were legitimate slave from their state when they were not. Those fake [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=531.6s)]
*  documents were then submitted to the government as though they were real [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=535.44s)]
*  possibly probably in violation of the law. What's more there is evidence that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=538.96s)]
*  Trump's inner circle was warned the plan could be unlawful. And so to be clear [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=544.24s)]
*  did you hear the White House counsel's office say that this plan to have [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  alternate electors meet and cast votes for Donald Trump in states that he had [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=554.24s)]

*  you remember. Mr. It was in our offices Mr. Meadows Mr. Giuliani and a few [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=564.72s)]
*  Giuliani's associates. So the fake electors case at the level of the fake [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=570.8s)]
*  electors seems pretty open and shut. The real question is how much of it came at [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=574.84s)]
*  the direction of Donald Trump himself. If one of the fake electors who says he [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=578.4399999999999s)]

*  Putin chef Evgeny Prigozhin the head of a Russian affiliated mercenary group [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=616.0s)]

*  Prigozhin followed up apparently by posting a series of audio messages on [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  the social media platform Telegram claiming the Russian minister of defense [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=637.8000000000001s)]

*  Moscow this is a fast moving and confusing situation but here's what we [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=708.96s)]
*  know in the last few minutes the White House National Security Council has [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=712.72s)]
*  confirmed President Biden has been briefed on what's going on inside Russia [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=716.76s)]
*  which tells you just how high the stakes are here. As you said the Russian [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=721.96s)]
*  government is now accusing Evgeny Prigozhin the volatile head of the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=726.28s)]
*  Wagner mercenary group of mounting a coup against the government of Vladimir [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  Putin. Prigozhin for his part having earlier said that the Russian military [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=736.2s)]
*  fired on his mercenary troops has now released an audio recording just the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=741.72s)]
*  last hour or so saying his mercenaries have crossed over from Ukraine where [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=746.68s)]
*  they are supposed to be fighting side by side with Russian regular forces and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=751.84s)]
*  that they are marching towards the southern Russian city of Rostov. Chris [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=755.96s)]
*  as you said there are not a lot of reliable narrators here Prigozhin is a [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=760.8s)]
*  man with a history of exaggeration there is no firm evidence at this point that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=764.52s)]
*  a column of his troops is indeed advancing towards Rostov but the Kremlin [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=771.12s)]
*  is not taking any chances this is a government that appears to be [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=775.92s)]
*  preparing for a military coup. Russian state media says the government has [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=780.16s)]
*  tightened security in Moscow and in other cities and Chris this internal [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=784.7199999999999s)]

*  on each other either with words or with guns as Prigozhin says the war here in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=801.44s)]
*  Ukraine continues to rage Ukrainian forces mounting that long-awaited [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=807.08s)]
*  counteroffensive and they are now hoping here in Kiev that they are facing an [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=811.8800000000001s)]

*  the New Yorker who's been writing about Putin's Russia for years wrote an [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=828.32s)]
*  incredible biography of Putin so Masha we've been covering this on the show [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=831.96s)]
*  Prigozhin is this strange figure he's called Putin's chef he ran a catering [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=835.7600000000001s)]

*  essentially oversaw the efforts to disrupt the 2016 election in certain [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=842.8000000000001s)]

*  real now yes? Oh I think it's always looked real right I mean this is what we've [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=868.44s)]
*  been looking at is Prigozhin is a very scary man yes and he has served as [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  Putin's enforcer he has served as Putin's shock troops his wielded private [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=880.0s)]
*  armies in Syria and now in Ukraine and he's grown exasperated and his [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=886.56s)]
*  exasperation has been basically reflected in what seems to be real-time [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=892.2s)]
*  on telegram over the last few weeks especially and the Ministry of Defense [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=896.4s)]
*  and the presidential administration has retaliated by basically telling him that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=903.32s)]
*  he should know his place and effectively trying to get his private army under [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=907.44s)]
*  control to to get it subsumed by the Ministry of Defense once Prigozhin got a [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=916.32s)]
*  little bit too uppity this is Prigozhin's reaction today he he has gone [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=921.96s)]
*  from criticizing Putin for not being decisive enough and not throwing enough [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=928.64s)]
*  resources at this war to saying look there was no reason to wage this war in [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=933.96s)]
*  the first place you have been lied to you my mercenaries you conscripted men [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=938.32s)]
*  you the Russian people have been lied to there's no point in running in fighting [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=945.48s)]
*  this war people are going getting killed for nothing and he has called on people [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=949.84s)]
*  to march to Moscow to restore justice so this is very explicitly an attempt in [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=954.2s)]
*  military coup it may very well fail right most military coups fail a lot of [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=960.56s)]
*  military coups that succeed have looked less serious less certainly more [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=967.0799999999999s)]
*  ridiculous than this one right and and now we enter a territory of totally [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=972.68s)]
*  unreliable information we know there's there's military equipment in the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=978.1999999999999s)]
*  streets of Moscow which is what you're showing right now we seem to know that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=984.5s)]
*  the building of the presidential administration of Moscow has been sealed off [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=989.4799999999999s)]

*  the border even though there is a warrant for his arrest but apparently from what [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1000.0799999999999s)]
*  they're saying right and from what may or may not be independent reports the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1004.9599999999999s)]
*  border guard are waving them right through is it because they're uninformed [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1009.8s)]
*  or is this not really happening we don't know the the the Prigozhin I mean the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1013.04s)]
*  video he posted at the beginning about the origins of the war was was [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  fascinating he had been as you said he was sort of a critic of the war from the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1022.1999999999999s)]
*  right basically that that the the Russian military ministry defense and [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1026.84s)]
*  show you go ahead they were they weren't throwing their all they're back into it [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1030.96s)]
*  right like he's out there his men are fighting and dying and and you guys [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1034.24s)]
*  aren't really committed to this war today he says basically you've been lied [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1037.84s)]
*  to about the origins of it it was because we had basically taken everything [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1042.76s)]
*  we could from the Donbass of eastern Ukraine and the Russian elite grew greedy [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1046.4399999999998s)]
*  that this was essentially like a this was conquest it wasn't defensive NATO is [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1050.8s)]
*  never coming in I mean a real like complete refutation of the story told [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1055.28s)]
*  about the war yeah and I think this is the this is actually important to the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1059.1999999999998s)]
*  larger picture we have no way of knowing how viable this attempted a military coup [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1067.4399999999998s)]
*  is right these things are so strange and they really you know they really [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1074.28s)]
*  depend not so much a military force or even public support they depend in a [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1080.2s)]
*  kind of game of nerves and credibility right so so we don't know how this is [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1084.72s)]
*  going to turn out but the larger point is that you know anybody who ultimately [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1090.1599999999999s)]
*  overturns Putin because there are two ways that the Putin ism can end right [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1097.6s)]
*  either pushing dies or there's a coup so if there is a coup even if it is staged [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1102.04s)]
*  by a hardliner it's going to be a hardliner for whom it's not his war and [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1108.68s)]
*  that's what we're seeing now is an illustration of that thesis and this is [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1112.8s)]
*  something really important to keep in mind because if he succeeds it's good [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1118.28s)]
*  news for Ukraine it's not his work it's not like Russia doing poorly in a war has [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1123.52s)]
*  ever led to the government falling before so it would be the first time of [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1129.76s)]
*  course Masha Gessen thank you so much thank you so much appreciate it [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHjfq-ASKo&t=1133.92s)]
