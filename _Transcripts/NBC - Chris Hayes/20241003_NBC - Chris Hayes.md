# ‘Crazy-making’ JD Vance puts on gaslighting clinic during debate
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I)
*  JD Vance lies with such ease so smoothly that even when you're paying attention and you know the score sometimes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=0.0s)]
*  you don't even know you're being lied to. And it drives me insane that moment in particular, that answer in the debate. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=6.24s)]
*  So here's the truth, everyone. The United States, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=11.52s)]
*  right now already produces more energy than any other nation on Earth and more energy than the U.S. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=16.32s)]
*  ever has in the past, including the Trump administration. In fact, the Biden Department of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Energy helped open the second of two nuclear reactors in Georgia in May. Those are the first nuclear plants in the U.S. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=26.88s)]
*  in 30 years. Just in July, Biden signed a bipartisan bill into law aimed at vastly growing domestic nuclear energy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=35.28s)]
*  What do you call it when someone says the opposite of the truth? Let's just call it the Trump-Vance campaign, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=44.24s)]
*  an entire political movement premised on Americans not believing their lying eyes, directing hate and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=50.0s)]
*  rage at outgroups rather than dealing with the thorny and difficult work of attempting to actually solve problems with actual solutions. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=55.76s)]
*  As Vance proved in his debate performance Tuesday night, he claimed there were 25 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=62.72s)]
*  a made-up figure he's repeated often on the campaign trail. The actual number, experts say, is less than half of that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=69.2s)]
*  He suggested the Haitian migrants of Springfield, Ohio were illegal aliens when, in fact, they hold legal protected status. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=74.96s)]
*  He falsely claimed Mexican cartels are running guns into the U.S. across the border. Everyone who covers the border knows guns flow from America, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=82.08s)]
*  where they're readily available, to Mexico, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=90.56s)]
*  He also said crime, inflation, and border crossings are up. The opposite is true. They are all falling. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=95.28s)]
*  My favorite lie was when Vance said, in a matter so assured I literally had a moment where I thought maybe I was missing something, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=102.16s)]
*  that Donald Trump spearheaded a bipartisan effort to save Obamacare. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=109.84s)]
*  Trump ran on a promise to kill the Affordable Care Act, and as Tim Walz pointed out, Trump came within one Senate vote of succeeding in killing it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=117.2s)]
*  This isn't about good faith disagreements on whether some policy will have the promised effects. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=126.0s)]
*  It's about gaslighting you not knowing what to believe. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=130.4s)]
*  We'll talk about why creating this alternate reality is a central project of the Trump fans' campaign. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=134.24s)]
*  Up next. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  They stole the FEMA money just like they stole it from a bank so they could give it to their [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=143.12s)]
*  illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=148.56s)]
*  Just a despicable delusional lie from Donald Trump spun out of whole cloth today, like so many of the things he says. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=154.96s)]
*  Combine that with his running mate, JD Vance's smooth delivery of deliberate lies in Tuesday's debate, and it becomes clear, creating an alternate reality is a central project of the Trump Vance campaign. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=161.52s)]
*  Adam Serwer is a staff writer for Atlantic, where he recently wrote about what conservatives mean by the freedom of speech and the rise of the right-wing tattletale. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  That's a great piece that I really recommend, and he joins me. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=180.4s)]
*  Adam, I've got to say, the smoothness, sometimes it really is the case, even though I do this professionally and deal with people and talk to politicians, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=183.68s)]
*  it is kind of a confidence game. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=191.68s)]
*  Like at 78, having done this shtick for so long and now sounding like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, the Trump lies are much easier to detect. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  But the JD Vance just smoothly saying that was the moment that really got me, like, we haven't been in a nuclear plant in 40 years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  I was like, I just did a podcast with the guy, the Department of Energy about the nuclear plant. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  But there's something so crazy making about the assuredness with which they do that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=215.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, JD Vance, he lies like a poster. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  He lies like someone who is constantly in online arguments and just has to make up a reason why he's correct. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=228.08s)]
*  And I think that's why you see him. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=234.72s)]
*  And I think that's why he's had a lot of practice on podcasts, just sort of pulling things out of his, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=237.44s)]
*  I won't say it because this is a family program. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  So true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  You know, so he just, he has an easy facility with, you know, what we might call, you know, bull. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that kind of thing. He's very good at it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=256.08000000000004s)]
*  But of course, you know, part of the reason he seems like he's good at it is that conservative media has created a sort of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=258.72s)]
*  chromatically sealed alternate universe in which the most important thing that's happening is whatever sort of weird [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=266.0s)]
*  episode that someone like Donald Trump or JD Vance has made up is the story of the day that is either distorted or exaggerated [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=276.72s)]
*  in some way to enhance the basic message of the political campaign. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  In this case, that clip that you were showing of Donald Trump saying that, you know, illegal immigrants were getting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  hurricane aid so that they would vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=294.72s)]
*  I mean, that illegal immigrants can't vote. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=298.16s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's just a complete it's just complete nonsense. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=300.48s)]
*  But in the Fox News cinematic universe, it makes a certain amount of sense because they believe and trust Donald Trump and JD Vance, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  and they don't believe and trust other sources of authority. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  I think it's it's sort of associated. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=316.8s)]
*  It's sort of connected, I think, to what the aspirations are past sort of this hermetically sealed right wing universe, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  which exists right now and is part of what can happen in a free society. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=326.6s)]
*  Right. People with freedom of press, they could they could create their own alternate universe and people can listen to that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=330.32s)]
*  But the aspirations sort of go past that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=336.36s)]
*  And I think this is what you're getting at in this piece today. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=338.32s)]
*  Threats of state retaliation against media outlets or anyone who speaks out against Trump illustrate that what conservatives mean when they talk [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=341.0s)]
*  about free speech is a legal right to use private platforms as venues for right wing propaganda, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=347.04s)]
*  whether or not those platforms wish to be used that way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=352.6s)]
*  And referencing threats of Google, threats at CBS, at ABC, that it's not enough to create the hermetically sealed universe. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=355.48s)]
*  The aspiration here is to make it everybody's universe. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=362.56s)]
*  Right. Well, remember, during the debate, when Donald Trump started repeating the smear about Haitian immigrants in Ohio, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=367.24s)]
*  he was fact checked and people were outraged by that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=374.2s)]
*  Why? Because conservatives believe that they essentially have a right to monologue. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=377.28s)]
*  They have a right to say what they want and you don't really have a right to disagree. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=382.12s)]
*  They can say what they want and you can say what they want. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=386.76s)]
*  And if you don't, well, you know, there will be punishment for that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=389.4s)]
*  Yes. And then we got the exact same moment in in that CBS debate, the one real moment of fact checking when he said that that Haitians were here [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  illegally and he was he was fact checked on that and he complained that, you know, you're not supposed to fact check. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=404.08s)]
*  And all the conservatives rushed to Twitter to decry it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  But it just further proves your thesis. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=413.2s)]
*  That piece is in The Atlantic, along with Adam's great piece on the sort of tattletale snitch state Republicans are building, particularly in Texas. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=415.2s)]
*  Adam, thank you so much. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOGXwtnF1-I&t=434.08s)]
