# ‘Exhausted’ Trump appears to fall asleep at campaign event
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU)
*  It has already been a very long campaign season for the man that you saw there, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=0.0s)]
*  his jaw jutting out in disappointment, Donald Trump. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  And it's really starting to show, I gotta say. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=8.08s)]
*  I mean, let's, again, to be just human here for a second, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=9.92s)]
*  relate to a person on stage or Mike doesn't work. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=14.72s)]
*  Campaign for president is hard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=18.0s)]
*  It's physically and emotionally, psychologically grueling. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=20.56s)]
*  It's difficult for any candidate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=23.92s)]
*  It's particularly gotta be really hard for the 78-year-old man [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=25.68s)]
*  who is the oldest major party nominee in U.S. history. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=30.8s)]
*  Have you seen him lately? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=36.96s)]
*  I mean, he is out there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=39.28s)]
*  He's given two, two and a half hour speeches, just word salads. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=41.36s)]
*  You have no idea what he's talking about. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=46.56s)]
*  He's talking about Hannibal Lecter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=48.88s)]
*  He's talking about this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=50.56s)]
*  He's talking about that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=51.84s)]
*  He's swaying to Ave Maria and YMCA for about half an hour. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=52.88s)]
*  Folks are standing there not sure what's happening. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=60.0s)]
*  Can you imagine if I did that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=63.92s)]
*  I think those concerns about competency are one of the reasons why one of the defining [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=68.64s)]
*  features of Trump's third campaign is how it's largely been sealed off in this alternate world [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  of safe spaces, friendly interviews with right-wing outlets, softball podcasts, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=78.0s)]
*  a town hall that devolved into a bizarre wordless dance recital set to Trump's comfort playlist. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=82.16s)]
*  When Trump rarely does step out from more traditional interview, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  he is forced to answer real questions on issues like his fitness for office, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=92.24s)]
*  and he just can't do it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=95.84s)]
*  You own and run businesses. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=99.6s)]
*  Would you appoint a CEO who was 78? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=102.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Give you a medical... [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  It depends on... [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=108.24s)]
*  I'd make people like Biden who's in bad shape. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't... [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=112.72s)]
*  I know many people in their 80s... [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  I know guys in their 80s that won't leave the company, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=115.28s)]
*  like family companies where they don't want the kids to take over, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  because they're much more competent than their kids. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  I took two cognitive tests and I aced them both. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=123.36s)]
*  I think that, frankly, people regardless should take... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=126.72s)]
*  If they're 50 or 40 or... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=132.0s)]
*  I think people should take cognitive tests, not because of the age, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=134.4s)]
*  but because of something else. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=138.32s)]
*  Something else? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=140.4s)]
*  What's the something else? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=140.96s)]
*  Now, considering all that, it should probably come as little surprise that Trump has cancelled [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=142.16s)]
*  a number of mainstream interviews in the final stretch of the campaign. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=145.68s)]
*  His team is citing exhaustion. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=149.6s)]
*  For anyone who's been following along, there's no doubt that Donald Trump really is tired. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  And again, I get it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  As the Harris-Walls campaign noted on social media, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=156.96s)]
*  an exhausted Trump appeared to fall asleep during his campaign event in Michigan today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  At that same event, he even complained about having to campaign. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=165.44s)]
*  How about we'll go through it pretty quick, Gal, and then I'm going over to make a little [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=169.84s)]
*  speech in front of 10,000 people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  You think this is an easy life I have, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=175.12s)]
*  I go from here, I say, am I finished? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=177.28s)]
*  They say, no, sir, you have one more speech. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=179.6s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=181.68s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=182.32s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  20 minutes, 30 minutes away? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  He does not look like he's enjoying himself. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=186.16s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump has always been one of the absolute weirder figures in American public life. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=188.32s)]
*  He's always said really disgusting and bigoted things, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=192.64s)]
*  and he has never hit his authoritarian desire. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=196.16s)]
*  So none of that's new. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=199.12s)]
*  But even grating on a curve for him, it seems as though every time he gets in front of a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=201.28s)]
*  microphone these days, what comes out of his mouth is a combination of incoherent and offensive. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=205.68s)]
*  I was so amazed that Harvey Weinstein got schlonged. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=212.4s)]
*  He got hit as hard as you can get hit because he was sort of the king of the world, correct? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=217.28s)]
*  Lincoln was probably a great president, although I've always said, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=222.32s)]
*  why wasn't that settled? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=225.84s)]
*  You know, I'm a guy that it doesn't make sense. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=226.88s)]
*  We had a civil war. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Do you find it weird they're not interested about why Kamala Harris was not at the Capitol [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=229.84s)]
*  on January 6 but was at the DNC when a pipe bomb was outside? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=233.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  They say, oh, yes, we're building cars. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=238.32s)]
*  They don't build cars. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=239.92s)]
*  They take them out of a box and they assemble them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  We could have our child do it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=243.28s)]
*  It's a rig deal. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=244.72s)]
*  The whole thing is rigged. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=245.6s)]
*  Why are they still being held? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=246.88s)]
*  Nobody's ever been treated like this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  Nobody's ever. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=251.12s)]
*  Maybe the Japanese during Second World War, frankly, but, you know, they were held too. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=251.92s)]
*  I think we have more of an enemy from within than we do from outside. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=257.76s)]
*  These are bad people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=260.96s)]
*  These are sick people and bad people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=262.56s)]
*  Is cocaine a stronger up? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=268.64s)]
*  So you're way up with cocaine more than anything else you can think of. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=270.32s)]
*  What's your favorite farm animal? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=273.68s)]
*  I'll tell you what I love. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=275.44s)]
*  I love cows. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  But if we go with Kamala, you won't have any cows. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=278.56s)]
*  I like conversation. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=281.12s)]
*  I don't seem to get myself in much trouble. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=284.24s)]
*  Now, just to be clear, when he was talking to, I think it was Dan Bongino, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=287.12s)]
*  about who it was that was treated like the Japanese in internment, he was referring to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  the January 6th folks who had been arrested and prosecuted and imprisoned for attempting [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=296.24s)]
*  to sack the Capitol. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=302.72s)]
*  That's who he was comparing to the Japanese who were interned. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=304.24s)]
*  Now, so all of that, you get a little sense there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=306.88s)]
*  That's how Donald Trump's campaign is going. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=308.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris, on the other hand, is running a very active campaign. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=310.4s)]
*  She's taking every opportunity to highlight the contrast between her and Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=314.0s)]
*  Now, he is ducking debates and canceling interviews. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=319.44s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=326.56s)]
*  And check this out, his own campaign team recently said it is because of exhaustion. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, if you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=340.4s)]
*  you are fit for the toughest job in the world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=345.44s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=350.32s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=352.23999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump's response today likely did little to assuage concerns about his fitness for office. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  What event did I cancel? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=361.12s)]
*  I haven't canceled. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=362.64s)]
*  She doesn't go to any events. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  She's a loser. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  She doesn't go to any events. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  She didn't even show up for the Catholics last night at the hotel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=368.0s)]
*  It was insulting. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=371.52s)]
*  All they are are soundbites. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=373.52s)]
*  So today I was at Fox and Friends at seven in the morning. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=375.2s)]
*  I then went to two different other appearances. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=378.88s)]
*  I then made about 15 phone calls. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=382.64s)]
*  I've gone 48 days now without a rest. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=384.96s)]
*  And I've got that loser who doesn't have the energy of a rabbit. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=387.84s)]
*  Now, that's, of course, a lie. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=392.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris does tons of media, including the traditional outlets that Trump dodges. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=394.0s)]
*  She even sat down for a very adversarial interview with Fox News just this week. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=397.52s)]
*  In fact, a key part of that campaign is showing voters exactly what Donald Trump has been saying. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  She did so again today because there's simply no denying that her 78-year-old opponent is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  incoherent and exhausted and floundering on the campaign trail with less than two weeks to go. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  It seems like maybe a bad idea to have him on the country, but what do I know? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  Lenziah Johnson is a Democratic strategist who served as a senior advisor for the Biden-Harris [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  2020 campaign. David Jolly is a former Republican congressman of Florida, and they both joined me [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=423.76s)]
*  now. It's interesting to me, Lenziah, with Donald Trump, it has always been an issue [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  of where you attack him if you're a political opponent, particularly Democrat. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot to say. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=439.52s)]
*  And in some ways, there's so much to say it overwhelms. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=442.08s)]
*  But this sort of idea of unfitness, which I can't tell if that's an argument to voters [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=444.56s)]
*  or it's also just a way of needling him. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  What do you think of that argument, which I think obviously is pretty merited at this point? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=451.84s)]
*  Listen, I think you've seen that the Democratic Party and the Harris campaign sees that this is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=456.96s)]
*  actually an argument that could persuade voters to not vote for him, to maybe stay home or just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=462.88s)]
*  vote or even more importantly, vote for Vice President Harris because they put out a campaign [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=468.56s)]
*  ad today calling him unfit and unstable. Here's what's really interesting and why it's so strategic [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=473.2s)]
*  and smart for Vice President Harris and the campaign to do this is because every time that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=480.32s)]
*  she hits him about being unstable, about being weak, about being unfit for office, it shifts away [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=485.36s)]
*  at his bravado style of politics and campaigning. And he can't actually campaign on issues. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=492.56s)]
*  He's flailing and completely going off the rails and trying to push back on these allegations that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=500.08s)]
*  quite frankly, the more that he plays into them, the worse he looks, which helps Democrats up and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=507.92s)]
*  down the ticket, including Vice President Harris. And so I think it's a strong campaign strategy [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  and that it's a quick campaign strategy for the Vice President's campaign. They can hit him about [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=519.84s)]
*  being unfit and unstable and then also talk about policy positions when all he can do is respond to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=524.24s)]
*  this. Yeah, by the way, I think his mic is back. So he's back talking again. I want to mention the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=529.76s)]
*  ad and I want to play this for you, David, and get your thoughts on it because I thought an [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=534.96s)]
*  interesting hybrid of the sort of he's unhinged, he has authoritarian aspirations and then a very [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=537.76s)]
*  kind of meat and potatoes midsection of this very quick 30 second ad. Take a listen. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=542.96s)]
*  Donald Trump makes a lot of promises, but we can be sure of one thing. If he wins, he'll ignore all [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=548.72s)]
*  checks that rein in a president's power. It's all in Trump's project 2025 agenda. What does that mean [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=554.64s)]
*  for you? Higher cost on groceries, cuts to Social Security and Medicare, more tax breaks [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=561.2s)]
*  for billionaires and a national abortion ban putting women's health at risk. A second Trump [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=566.88s)]
*  term, more unhinged, unstable and unchecked. Interesting ad, David. Yeah, Chris, I think [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  it's fascinating because we are entering the period where we're seeing the closing argument. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=580.32s)]
*  And I think to Alencia's point, it may be that the Vice President is choosing to make her closing [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=584.24s)]
*  argument, not necessarily about her own policy platform, which she's proposed many policies, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=589.76s)]
*  but about Donald Trump's fitness. And I think what it also indicates is there are very few gettable [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=594.56s)]
*  voters out there, but the most gettable voters are probably the voters that are concerned about [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=600.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's fitness. Maybe it's the danger to democracy argument, but it is the chaos argument [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=605.76s)]
*  you hear the Vice President make the word unhinged. Those are the persuadable voters that are left. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=611.28s)]
*  And then contrast that with Donald Trump. He's doing nothing to reach those voters. If anything, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=616.64s)]
*  his closing argument is pushing those voters farther away. And so you saw her reach out to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=622.0s)]
*  soft Republicans in Bucks County, Pennsylvania this week. You're seeing this notion of the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=627.28s)]
*  president being unhinged. Sure, she's going to hit on those quick policy points like you saw, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  particularly on reproductive freedom. But I think her closing argument is an acknowledgement that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=635.6s)]
*  this decision this year is about Donald Trump and whether or not he is a safe person to return to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=639.84s)]
*  the White House. It's a powerful argument. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-UgnGl28GU&t=645.52s)]
