# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 23
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8)
*  So the argument from the Federal Society, the anti-abortion right, at least some of them, for overturning Roe v. Wade was and has been that Roe wrongly took the issue of abortion rights away from the people and that the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe then returned the democratic process to its [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=0.0s)]
*  rice full place and to the people in the states. Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his concurring opinion stated that simply that argument quite simply he wrote the Dobbs decision quote, properly leaves the question of abortion for the people in the democratic process through that democratic process the people and their representatives may decide to allow or limit abortion. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=17.5s)]
*  Now as poll after poll is shown the people aren't that interested in bans on abortion the kinds that have come in the wake of the Dobbs decision. Abortion bans are really incredibly unpopular and so Republicans and conservatives have been using all sorts of increasingly anti-democratic subterfuge to have their way on banning abortion over the objections of the majority of their own voters. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=38.2s)]
*  Take North Carolina for example right? Republicans in the state legislature recently gained a super majority when this woman, Trisha Coven, a Democrat who ran on abortion rights and co-sponsored a bill to codify Roe in the state's constitution inexplicably switched parties and she gave them a super majority and then conservatives and Republicans then used their new veto-proof super majority to pass an abortion ban in North Carolina over the objections of the electorate, it pulled pretty poorly, and over the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=62.1s)]
*  veto of the governor who was a Democrat and was democratically elected statewide. So that's North Carolina. Now here's what's happening in Ohio right now. That state's six week abortion ban is currently tied up in court. Its 22 week ban is still in effect. There's a coalition of organizations that are currently collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures to put the question of a constitutional amendment to enshrine reproductive rights in the state's constitution on the ballot in November. The people, right, voting or in Justice Kavanaugh's words to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=92.1s)]
*  leave the question abortion for the people in the Democratic process. Similar efforts to support abortion rights have been very successful even in states that are pretty conservative like Kentucky. And Ohio Republicans and anti-abortion activists know this. So what they're trying to do is take the decision out of the hands of majority of Ohio voters. They introduced their own constitutional amendment that would raise the ballot initiative threshold that has been in place for, get this, over 100 years from a simple [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=122.1s)]
*  majority of 50% plus one to 60%. And Republicans are now trying to do this and get it done before that pro-abortion rights constitutional amendment can get on November's ballot. Meaning they want to put their own anti-democratic proposal up for a vote during a special election in August. Even though Republicans in Ohio themselves recently passed a law outlawing the majority of August special elections, not to mention a bipartisan group of Ohio [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=152.1s)]
*  election officials formally voted to oppose the Republican bill because they don't want to run a statewide election in August. The Republicans play here is being challenged in court, but it's clear what's going on here, right? A maneuver designed explicitly to motivate hardcore anti-abortion proponents to come out in the dead of summer in a low turn on election so then they can move the goal posts and make it nearly impossible for a simple majority of Ohioans to decide to secure [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=182.1s)]
*  abortion rights in their state. No one has been chronicling this movement of anti-democratic anti-majoritarian politics in the states more than David Pepper. He's the author of Laboratories of Autocracy, a Wake Up Call from Behind the Lines and the new book Saving Democracy, the User's Manual for Every American. He's also the former chair of the Ohio Democratic Party and he joins me now. Good to have you here. Great to be with you, although it makes my blood boil. Well, it is really, it's almost, I mean, it's not comical because the states are high, but, but it's so, the sort of manifest pretext behind the whole thing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=212.1s)]
*  Always just strikes me. It's outrageous. I mean, the whole sequence, and keep in mind, this legislature itself is the result of multiple violations of Supreme Court orders that this map is itself gerrymandered. So their legitimacy is already in question. This is an unconstitutional map that led to these guys in the first place. So we're piling lawlessness on top of lawlessness over and over again, and this is what you get when that happens. Right, because you've got, it's one of these states, it's not quite as bad as Wisconsin, North Carolina, but it's in the ballpark where you've got a state that's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=242.1s)]
*  a pretty Republican state at this point. It's a plus seven state plus eight in presidential elections, but you've got enormous majorities, right, in both houses because they set those gerrymandered. They would not have had the votes to approve this measure a couple weeks ago without the illegal gerrymandered they're living within. So that's just one other level of lawlessness. So they've got the gerrymandered and they use that supermajority to put this on the ballot. They're now going to put, they're going to put this on the ballot. Are they honest about why they're doing this? Like when they, when they give the argument for why suddenly it has to be a 60% threshold. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=272.1s)]
*  No, it's a joke. I mean, they're saying they need to protect the constitution for the first time in a hundred years. They have to protect the constitution months before what you just described a citizen led ballot initiative to actually have the people vote on abortion access. By the way, when the Supreme Court came out with that opinion, it was gaslighting from the very beginning. They know that most of these states are gerrymandered. They do not reflect the people. Kansas showed that with its referendum last August and these legislators know that's why. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=302.1s)]
*  Every poll in Ohio shows that about close to 60%. And that's why that's such an important number. Close to 60% of Ohioans support Roe v. Wade in general abortion access. Almost none support abortion bans. No exceptions. That said that 10 year old girl to Indiana who was raped. These guys know that. And as you've described, it's so blatant. They're moving the goalpost. But let's be clear. Now I hope this comes out this way. I'm not sure it will. They themselves made a special election August illegal. Right. And they did not revoke that law. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=332.1s)]
*  Okay. So this is another great layer on top of this. So basically they're on this race, right? They see the abortion rights advocates are going to get this ballot initiative November. Right. They're like, we want to raise the threshold to change the rules of the game before they can get there November. So we have to have our election here in August. Correct. The dead of August. Right. Now the state, the county election officials who are a lot of them were Republican are like, what the hell are you doing? We don't want this. Right. But they already passed a law saying you can't have special elections in August. Yeah. And they try to get the votes to repeal. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=362.1s)]
*  That law, but they didn't have the vote. So they just stopped trying to repeal it. And they're just saying we should have it anyway. By the way, the secretary of state announced to those elections officials months ago, the great victory of getting rid of these August elections. It was a bipartisan victory. The author of the of the August election idea himself said this was a career long goal of mine to get rid of August elections. Months later, they can't repeal it, but they still demand an election on date where it's currently illegal to have a statewide special election in Ohio. So this is where we get back. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=392.1s)]
*  So these sort of layers of anti-democrats. So that challenge to the legality of this August 8th elections, going to go to a state. It's the Ohio Supreme Court. And what's how we doing over in the Supreme Court? Unfortunately, we had our Wisconsin moment a couple of years ago. We actually got ourselves an independent court. Then they changed those rules and added party label to the ballot, move those races up to the top. And now they have themselves. Oh, I forgot about that. Right. There's another court changed hands. It did. We had a moderate chief justice. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=422.1s)]
*  Who is a long time Republican who with three Democrats voted against every gerrymandered map. But in the meantime, they switched the rules of how we elect justices like they did North Carolina and then violated for a year all the court orders. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=452.1s)]
*  As I always say, if we saw this in another country, we would be saying, my God, you have no rule of law. Well, that's Ohio right now in 2023. And it's not just Ohio. I mean, it's we have seen similar stuff happen in Wisconsin. We've seen it happen in North Carolina. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  There's proposals in Missouri right now. I mean, your first book, which which I read and is excellent, really does a really good job of talking about this. I mean, the flip side of it, which I think has been somewhat successful in Ohio is there really has been mobilization by voters. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  And Ohioans to be like, we don't this is not OK. It reminds me of 2011, the anti collective bargaining bill that we rescinded right now. You're single. It's just so over the top. It's so blatantly dishonest. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=494.5s)]
*  And you even have, you know, former Governor Taft, who was a former Secretary of State John Kasich, former Attorney General, all saying that this is outrageous. So I hope that we're seeing a bill. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=506.5s)]
*  The Libertarian Party came out against this. It's very conservative groups who themselves want to bring things to the ballot, saying this is too much. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=517.5s)]
*  So my hope is that, and by the way, one other thing backdrop, this is the most corrupt statehouse in the country, according to the FBI. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=524.7s)]
*  The speaker of the House who had to resign and remember will be sentenced in June for the largest bribery scandal in the history of Ohio. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=532.42s)]
*  So this is against the backdrop of corruption. That trial is still playing out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=539.54s)]
*  And so a statehouse normally would respond with reform, but they're responding, grab more power from the voters, more power from themselves. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=543.78s)]
*  So my hope is there's enough a buildup that we crush this thing in August. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=551.9s)]
*  And one of the things that's really important here is if this passes in Ohio, they do operate as laboratories of autocracy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=555.4599999999999s)]
*  Let's be clear. They'll do it. Other states will do it. So we can all be the country's favorite. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=560.38s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, right. I mean, this crush in Ohio. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=564.82s)]
*  So the billionaire, there's this big Illinois billionaire backing the whole thing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=568.06s)]
*  He's a rounder. Is this I don't remember. His name is you line or something. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=572.42s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The you line. Yeah. I want him to feel like this was such a monumental waste of money. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=576.22s)]
*  It's not worth doing anywhere else. It's too much. It's too much of a power grab. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=582.02s)]
*  And that's again, if this passes, it's coming everywhere that they can do this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=585.34s)]
*  If it fails, then I think we make progress beyond Ohio. It's that important. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=590.06s)]
*  All right. David Pepper, whose new book is called Saving Democracy, a user's manual for every American out now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=594.3399999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming in. Thanks. Great to be with you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=599.3399999999999s)]
*  Just two weeks after January 6th, an incredibly poignant and powerful moment. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  Twenty two year old Amanda Gorman stood up at President Biden's inauguration and read one of her poems. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=608.0999999999999s)]
*  We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=615.22s)]
*  inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  Our blenders become their burdens. But one thing is certain. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=626.1s)]
*  If we merge mercy with might into might with right, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=631.98s)]
*  then love becomes our legacy and change our children's birthright. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=637.1800000000001s)]
*  That poem, The Hill We Climb, is now banned for elementary classes at a school in Miami Dade after one parent, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=644.9s)]
*  just a single parent complained the poem was not educational and had, I quote directly, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=651.34s)]
*  indirectly hate is not educational, indirectly hate messages. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  That is, the purpose was to cause confusion and indoctrinate students. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=662.02s)]
*  That one complaint was enough for the school to ban elementary school kids from reading that poem by the first ever [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=666.54s)]
*  national youth poet laureate and the youngest ever inaugural poet. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=672.22s)]
*  That was made possible by one man and his facilitators in the legislature, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=675.98s)]
*  Tonight, Amanda Gorman has responded to the ban, saying, quote, I am gutted. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=683.46s)]
*  I wrote The Hill We Climb so that all young people could see themselves in a historical moment. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=687.46s)]
*  Robbing children of the chance to find their voices in literature is a violation of their right to free thought and free speech. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=692.02s)]
*  She also urged people to speak out, pointing to a lawsuit. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=698.82s)]
*  Her publisher has joined along with Penn America and others against another Florida school district in Escambia County that is banned books. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=701.82s)]
*  I'm joined now by Suzanne Nocell, who's the CEO of Penn America and Lindsay D'Urci, who has two children in that district and is also a plaintiff in the suit. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=710.0200000000001s)]
*  It's good to have you both here. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=719.1s)]
*  Let me start with you, Suzanne, just in terms of level setting on these book bans and why they're happening in Florida. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=721.2600000000001s)]
*  Like, there's a little bit of an ambiguity here, right? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=727.78s)]
*  They pass a law that essentially routinizes parental complaints as a means of getting books reviewed, removed. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=731.54s)]
*  But then the state doesn't have to sort of take credit for it happening. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=740.26s)]
*  Like, how does it actually happen and what's the contestation of your lawsuit? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=744.26s)]
*  Sure. Look, there are two laws in Florida, what we call the don't say gay law, the law that prohibits discussion of LGBTQ topics in school. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=747.74s)]
*  And then a law that does similarly when it comes to discussions about race that are contentious, that could make somebody feel perhaps guilty about their race. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=757.74s)]
*  And what those two laws have done is create an enabling environment for book banning. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=766.9s)]
*  And in many districts, as you say, it takes only a single individual, doesn't necessarily would have to be a parent to lodge an objection. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=771.98s)]
*  I mean, that objection to Amanda Gorman's book is illustrative. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=779.22s)]
*  It's a few lines just scribbled out. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=782.5s)]
*  The person clearly hasn't read the poem. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=784.58s)]
*  They don't give any detail. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=787.06s)]
*  And that is enough to get a book pulled from the shelves for a review process that can go on for months and months denying kids the book. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=788.66s)]
*  In a scambia, it's particularly egregious because there is a review panel of educators and librarians who look at these books. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=797.66s)]
*  But time and again, the school board's overridden them. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=804.0999999999999s)]
*  They've decided these books have merit. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  They belong in the classroom. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=809.3s)]
*  There's value here that the kids can derive. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=810.4599999999999s)]
*  And the school board says, no, these are contentious. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=812.66s)]
*  We think we can score political or ideological points by whisking these books away. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=816.26s)]
*  And that's what they've done. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=820.34s)]
*  Lindsay, your parent in the scambia county, why did you choose to join this lawsuit? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=821.26s)]
*  Well, Chris, restricted access to information and viewpoint censorship violates our students first amendment rights. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=827.78s)]
*  And I think there are so many teachers and parents that just don't feel safe speaking up against it. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=834.6600000000001s)]
*  So I thought it was time that I say something. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=839.1800000000001s)]
*  Have you had experience firsthand, like in terms of your kids schools or in terms of other parents lodging complaints for books? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=843.22s)]
*  Has this energized what seems to be a relatively small group of obsessives file complaints about books? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=850.38s)]
*  But have you seen this firsthand in scambia county where your kids go to school? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=859.46s)]
*  A hundred percent. Yes. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=864.1800000000001s)]
*  Primarily at school board meetings and moments where we're talking about the books that these committees have reviewed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=867.26s)]
*  Like Suzanne said. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=872.9399999999999s)]
*  Suzanne, what is the contention? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=875.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, Lindsay just said this about sort of First Amendment rights. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=877.98s)]
*  What's the what's the substance of the lawsuit? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=880.74s)]
*  It's twofold. First Amendment and 14th Amendment. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=883.22s)]
*  The First Amendment aspect is that what these districts are doing with scambia is doing is picking and choosing on ideological grounds which books are going to be taken off shelves. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=886.06s)]
*  That's viewpoint based discrimination. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=895.8199999999999s)]
*  It strikes right at the heart of what the First Amendment protects against and bars government for doing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=897.86s)]
*  So that's piece one. The second piece is 14th Amendment. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=903.9s)]
*  Overwhelmingly, the targeted books are books by and about authors of color, LGBTQ narratives. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=906.7s)]
*  And so it's quite clear there's a discriminatory purpose. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=913.34s)]
*  They're trying to eradicate certain stories, certain individuals from the curriculum. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=916.1s)]
*  And that's discriminatory. And that violates kids right to an equal education. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=921.74s)]
*  And so we're bringing both claims and trying to vindicate both sets of constitutional rights. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=925.62s)]
*  Lindsay, there's this amazing Washington Post reporting this is looking at for from 30,000 feet from nationally an analysis of book challenges from across the nation shows the majority were filed by. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=932.1s)]
*  And this is not a typo. Just 11 people. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=943.22s)]
*  So there's there's people that are really, really, really into this. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=947.42s)]
*  But I do wonder, like, I guess the perception we end up having is that like DeSantis did this, but he won a resounding reelection. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=950.66s)]
*  He's popular in Florida. This is what parents want. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=956.54s)]
*  I'm just curious, like, to the extent there's conversation around the soccer field or PTA, what your what your sense of the popularity or unpopularity of this is. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=958.82s)]
*  So I've got nothing but positive feedback from our community. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=972.58s)]
*  From surprisingly, I've not gotten a lot of negative feedback at all. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=977.02s)]
*  But I think that our district's policy manual clearly says that it's our school's responsibility, our public school's responsibility to provide a comprehensive collection of books that foster respect for diversity and cultural appreciation. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=984.74s)]
*  And so I understand that it's not going to resonate with everyone, but it does resonate with most people. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1002.78s)]
*  You know, Lindsey, I'm a parent of three school-aged children myself, and I see people make this argument that parents should be the ones to decide what's in a school library. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1010.66s)]
*  And I'm like, what, you want me to go through a list of 200 books? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1017.62s)]
*  I don't that's that I can't do that with every parent in the school. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1021.74s)]
*  Like, do you think it's a good idea to have one parent to exercise veto power over books in schools? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1027.3s)]
*  Well, of course not. And, you know, to quote Jody Pico, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the parent deciding a certain book's not right for their child. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1035.78s)]
*  But there's a colossal problem with the parent deciding, therefore, that no child should be able to read that book. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1042.8999999999999s)]
*  This has been filed, I believe, in federal court. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1049.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  There is, it seems, there's like the legal aspect and the cultural aspect, which Penn, I think, is uniquely sort of situated. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1053.02s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder, like, are we in the grips of a panic? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1059.74s)]
*  Are we in the grips of a panic about the panic? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1062.34s)]
*  Like, are there a lot of books really being banned? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1064.2199999999998s)]
*  It does seem like the numbers bear this out. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1066.6999999999998s)]
*  What is your sense of where we are sort of culturally in terms of this kind of censoriousness that we're seeing? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1068.3s)]
*  Look, I think Lindsey's right that the overwhelming majority of Americans don't like book bans. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1073.6999999999998s)]
*  It runs counter to our basic notions of our freedom to speak, freedom to read. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1079.26s)]
*  And so it's a question of mobilizing people. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1084.3s)]
*  I think there's an effort here to play to a very particular constituency. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1086.02s)]
*  Well, the 11 people. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1090.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1092.26s)]
*  The 11 righteous book banners. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1092.82s)]
*  Right. And, you know, there's an election on the horizon. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1094.3s)]
*  And I think there's a notion that certain people can get energized and motivated by this. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1097.42s)]
*  And they're going to play to that segment and rile them up. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1102.02s)]
*  And it's up to us to mobilize the rest, the majority. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1107.06s)]
*  This is about parents' rights indeed. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1110.78s)]
*  It's not the rights of those 11 parents. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1112.9s)]
*  It's the rights of the millions of parents whose access, kids' access is at stake. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPSTYAtcry8&t=1114.74s)]
