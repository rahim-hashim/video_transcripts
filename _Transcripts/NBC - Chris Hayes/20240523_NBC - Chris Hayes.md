# George Conway trolls Trump with billboard near Mar-a-Lago
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss)
*  In the Republican primary campaign, Nikki Haley became a kind of avatar for never Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans for the millions of people who are either still registered as Republicans [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=4.44s)]
*  or used to be and still identify at some level as such, but are fundamentally disgusted by [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=8.32s)]
*  what the parties become. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  It seemed clear that Haley would just end up where almost every professional Republican [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  politician ends up, which is ultimately just rolling over. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=20.64s)]
*  And yesterday she made it official. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=25.16s)]
*  I'll be voting for the guy I told you was unstable and unhinged. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=27.12s)]
*  I will be voting for Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=33.88s)]
*  Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=42.0s)]
*  support me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  He would be smart. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  That's good advice. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Glad you're giving him advice. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  One of the last people who had represented some sort of internal party resistance to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=55.4s)]
*  the monstrous authoritarian vision of MAGA, and Donald Trump is now endorsing him. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=59.12s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=63.32s)]
*  George Conway was once a Republican. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=64.32s)]
*  He's an attorney and a contributing writer at The Atlantic, and he joins me now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=66.6s)]
*  I think the odds of this moment happening were close to 100 percent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=70.56s)]
*  But I suppose it is definitive if there was any question about the Republican Party, what [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=76.16s)]
*  it is and what it means at this moment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=82.84s)]
*  It's a cult. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=85.88s)]
*  I mean, that's the only way you can describe it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=86.88s)]
*  And everyone has, I mean, it consists of basically two groups of people, mostly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Some people who have basically completely lost it, you know, the people we see in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=95.56s)]
*  House of Representatives. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=100.6s)]
*  And then there are people who are basically afraid to call out that so many people have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  lost it, including, you know, I mean, that's basically what just happened here with Nikki [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=106.74s)]
*  Haley. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=112.0s)]
*  And the person who has really lost it the most is Donald Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=113.0s)]
*  I mean, he, you know, he's the crazy one, and everybody is getting more crazy than he [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=115.64s)]
*  is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=120.36s)]
*  And as Nikki Haley pointed out when she was telling the truth for a couple of weeks in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=121.36s)]
*  the spring, I mean, he's mentally unstable and he's getting worse. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=126.88s)]
*  And we can see it every day in the courthouse. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=129.88s)]
*  We can see it when he's standing out there complaining about the temperature, when thermometers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=132.76s)]
*  in the courtroom say at 74, 75 degrees, he's saying it's freezing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=138.44000000000003s)]
*  You know, he's, you know, the lies about the election or talking about his friend praising [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=143.28s)]
*  Hannibal Lecter. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=149.02s)]
*  I mean, this guy, he is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, and he's getting, as Nikki Haley rightly pointed [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=150.02s)]
*  out, he's getting worse. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=156.84s)]
*  You put up this billboard outside. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=159.44000000000003s)]
*  Is it near Doral or Mar-a-Lago? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  It is near Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=165.08s)]
*  It is a few, a couple of exits south of where you, if you, for example, were at Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=166.72s)]
*  and you happen to want to play golf at the Doral Resort, you go onto I-95, you drive [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=173.64s)]
*  south and like one or two exits, on the right you will see this sign, either on the way [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=178.55999999999997s)]
*  up or on the way back or both. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=184.64s)]
*  And I thought, you know, on a lark I decided, hey, that's a good place to put the sign. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  I'd been making some hats that say that, like, kind of like the MAGA hats except blue [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=191.56s)]
*  and white and some bumper stickers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=197.56s)]
*  And a fellow named Claude Taylor, who runs this pack called the Mag Dog Pack, has been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=200.68s)]
*  putting up a bumper, not bumper stickers, but billboards. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=204.86s)]
*  And you know, he texted me just, I think maybe yesterday or the day before, we had a few [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=210.44s)]
*  text exchanges say, hey, I'd like, I'd like to, how much would it cost to put one of these [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=215.0s)]
*  up? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=218.72s)]
*  I thought about putting it up at the Holland Tunnel or the Lincoln Tunnel, but it turns [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=219.88s)]
*  out he's staying, he's not going to Bedminster this summer, some reporters tell me, because [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=224.48s)]
*  he's, you know, the campaign's going to be run out of an office near West Palm Beach [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=229.32s)]
*  Airport. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=233.88s)]
*  So, this was the perfect location and I hope he sees it and, you know, I hope it amuses [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=234.88s)]
*  him as much as it amuses me. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=239.8s)]
*  I think he will notice it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=241.52s)]
*  You said yesterday, we can talk about this division between people who have lost it and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=243.4s)]
*  people who are afraid to speak up about that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=246.68s)]
*  You said this yesterday about the upshot of the Haley endorsement and the Alito flag. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people have lost, right, the rights have lost their minds, a lot of the people [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=253.68s)]
*  who are right are afraid to say it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=256.68s)]
*  And I think that one of the things that's a little chilling about the Alito news is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  that he's in category one as opposed to category two, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=264.04s)]
*  I mean, this is your circle, George. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=268.56s)]
*  These are your people, man. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=271.72s)]
*  You spent your whole career around these folks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=272.92s)]
*  You keep insulting me like that, I'm going to leave. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=275.22s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I can't explain it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think that I think there has been this steady deterioration in the sort of the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  psychological health of a good many people on the right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=289.52s)]
*  I mean, why would you? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=292.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm not talking about why would you talk about this? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=293.4s)]
*  This is the thing that I find. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=296.92s)]
*  I find it so fascinating. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Like I can imagine you imagine. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=299.92s)]
*  Imagine George, imagine yourself, OK, ten years ago, and you're talking to a young up [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=301.8s)]
*  and coming 45 year old, 42 year old, like Federalist Society, really bright Supreme [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=307.48s)]
*  Court clerk, highly pedigree district court judge. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  And they're like, I'm going to fly this flag for my house. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=317.36s)]
*  Like obviously, your advice would be, are you out of your mind? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=321.56s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  You're a federal judge. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=327.92s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  You can't do it, but also don't do it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's completely I just can't fathom it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=334.14s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what to think about this other than it's just a horrible, horrible [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=337.38s)]
*  judgment. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=344.06s)]
*  I mean, if it's a gag, it's a horrible judgment. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=345.06s)]
*  If it means something, it's even worse. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=346.74s)]
*  I can't I can't fathom it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=348.46s)]
*  Well, luckily, judgment has nothing to do with the job that he has for the rest of his [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=350.97999999999996s)]
*  natural life. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  George Conway. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=356.53999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlx7FxvFGss&t=357.53999999999996s)]
