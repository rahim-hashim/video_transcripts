# Trump accuser Natasha Stoynoff reacts to E. Jean Carroll verdict: 'Moment of truth'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0)
*  So, during the civil trial that found Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing writer Eugen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Carroll, Carroll's lawyers brought forth 11 witnesses to corroborate her story and as [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  well as demonstrate a pattern of misconduct by the ex-president. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=9.84s)]
*  One of those witnesses was Natasha Stoynov, a former People magazine writer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=14.36s)]
*  She testified that Donald Trump sexually assaulted her back in 2005 when she traveled to Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=18.44s)]
*  to write a profile on him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=22.8s)]
*  Trump denies assaulting anyone. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=24.68s)]
*  Stoynov told the jury she didn't come forward earlier because, quote, I was ashamed and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=26.56s)]
*  humiliated to what had happened. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=30.88s)]
*  I was worried they would kill the story and then Trump would try and get revenge on me [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=32.6s)]
*  and try and destroy me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=36.4s)]
*  And Natasha Stoynov joins me now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=37.72s)]
*  First of all, I just want to say thank you very much for coming on this evening. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  I really appreciate you coming. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=43.56s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=45.04s)]
*  I'm really glad to be here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=46.04s)]
*  First, just your reaction as someone who had to go to a jury and take an oath and look [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=48.08s)]
*  at those jurors and look at that courtroom and relive what happened to you, your reaction [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=54.64s)]
*  to today's verdict. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=58.96s)]
*  My reaction was elation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=62.56s)]
*  I was really surprised that it happened so fast and I figured that that was going to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=64.4s)]
*  be good news. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=69.08s)]
*  And you know, when I went into the courtroom, it was very, it was such a moment of truth. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  I just spoke directly to the jury and I didn't really notice anyone else in the room. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=80.22s)]
*  And I just tried to calmly tell them what happened. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=85.44s)]
*  And as I spoke to them, it really took me back to those moments, which is why I ended [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  up tearful several times. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=92.08s)]
*  And I just hope that that means that they believed me and trusted me and that helped [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  with this trial. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=98.96s)]
*  Jane Manning, who was my guest in the first block, made a point that I thought was interesting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=99.96s)]
*  I'd love to hear what you think about it, which is that because it was a federal civil [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  trial, your testimony and the testimony of others was allowed to come in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  In many jurisdictions, it wouldn't be. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=111.44s)]
*  It would be viewed as excessively prejudicial, but it was allowed and it was allowed by this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=113.52s)]
*  judge. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=117.32s)]
*  And the Carol's lawyer said this established a pattern along the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=118.32s)]
*  How important do you think it was that people like your safe self were able to come into [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=124.0s)]
*  that room and say what happened to you? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=128.0s)]
*  I think it was extremely important. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=131.76s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if we're going to hear from the jury at all who remain anonymous [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=133.64s)]
*  about how important. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=138.48s)]
*  I think the pattern was very crucial for this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=140.9s)]
*  And I also think that perhaps mine and Jessica's testimony, perhaps even mine more so, was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  able to sort of fill in gaps that perhaps E-Jeans didn't have. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=150.3s)]
*  I knew exactly when mine happened. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=155.02s)]
*  I knew where it was. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  So did E-Jean, of course. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=159.3s)]
*  But I could give a lot of specifics. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=160.44s)]
*  So I'm hoping that that helps sort of convince the jury of the truth of our stories. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=162.66s)]
*  There was this moment, I believe, that you came forward on the record with your story [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=170.22s)]
*  subsequent to the Access Hollywood tape or in the year of 2016, if I'm not mistaken, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=174.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=181.62s)]
*  2016. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=182.62s)]
*  Yeah, 2016. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=183.62s)]
*  And there was this moment where you and others came forward talking to reporters saying, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=184.62s)]
*  like, he did this to me. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=189.66000000000003s)]
*  There was this moment where it seemed like maybe he'll drop out or Republicans will ban [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  on him, and then he didn't. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=196.78s)]
*  And then he became the president of the United States. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=198.18s)]
*  What did that moment feel like? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=200.94s)]
*  And what does today feel like? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=202.94s)]
*  Like, does it feel like some cosmic balancing of the scales in some way? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=204.5s)]
*  It almost feels like a repeat because last time I thought for sure he wasn't going to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=209.22s)]
*  win. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=217.1s)]
*  And there was a drop in polls, I think, after my story came out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=218.1s)]
*  And I was really shocked when he won. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=222.26s)]
*  So I really don't know what to expect this time again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=224.68s)]
*  I just hope that—I'm still nervous about it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=229.12s)]
*  I just hope that just being there and this trial and the victory has some sort of effect [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  on some Americans because he didn't win by that much now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=239.84s)]
*  He won by about 70,000 in the electoral college, you know, states. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=244.24s)]
*  And it has to affect some. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=248.08s)]
*  And I want to say one thing about the pattern. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=250.12s)]
*  There were patterns that, in my story, that mimicked e-jeans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  And that's another reason why I think my testimony was important. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=256.38s)]
*  Being in the room alone, the door shut, that sort of thing, pushed against the wall. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=258.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=262.3s)]
*  In fact, that was really striking. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=263.3s)]
*  I've read your testimony that you gave before the jury and how much they evoked it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  And we've seen this in other circumstances of men who have been established to have done [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=269.26s)]
*  this systematically, that they have patterns, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=273.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=277.7s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein in his robe. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=278.7s)]
*  That is coming to mind. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=281.3s)]
*  What do you want to say to people, survivors of sexual abuse or sexual assault, who are [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=283.94000000000005s)]
*  watching this or who have followed this story, about what you've learned from this experience? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=289.42s)]
*  Because I suspect it's been hard to do and certainly hard to do in 2016 and hard to do [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=296.94000000000005s)]
*  again in 2023. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=301.58000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's really hard to do just in general, to come forward about these kind of things. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  And then when someone is so powerful, i.e. the most powerful man in the world, it's like [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=309.38s)]
*  a thousand times harder. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=315.3s)]
*  And I hope that women and men or whoever feel like they're victims, that they feel that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=317.62s)]
*  no matter how much time has gone by, that there's always a chance for justice. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  And I also hope that they feel that maybe they can tell somebody. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=330.06s)]
*  Because even if you can't go to the police, maybe you can go to a friend. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=333.94s)]
*  Look, E.G. told two friends. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  I told several friends and family. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=339.86s)]
*  I feel like if you can just tell somebody, that will help in some way, whether it's down [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=341.74s)]
*  the road legally or just emotionally for yourself. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=346.94s)]
*  What is what do you think about what E.G. and Carol has done here, given the fact that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=351.22s)]
*  this was her case and given the fact that this took a tremendous amount of effort and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  persistence on her part? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=360.94000000000005s)]
*  She's one of the most bravest people I've ever met and wonderful. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  And her persistence and staying power inspires me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=368.5s)]
*  She's the reason I testified. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  It's not like I really like to be in a legal situation like this and get in front of a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=376.94s)]
*  room full of people and tell that story. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=382.18s)]
*  I've never told that story verbally before, by the way. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=383.82s)]
*  That was the first time I ever did. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=386.46s)]
*  And I did it because of her inspiration and her strength. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=388.82s)]
*  I got to say, I did. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=394.18s)]
*  I read your testimony, partly because reporters that were in the courtroom that day talked [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=395.18s)]
*  about just how profoundly compelling it was indeed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=399.82s)]
*  And it was it was remarkable testimony. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=401.98s)]
*  And I appreciate you taking some time with us tonight. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=403.54s)]
*  Thank you, Natasha Stoynov. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=406.98s)]
*  Thanks so much, Chris. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WphczD_WyP0&t=407.98s)]
