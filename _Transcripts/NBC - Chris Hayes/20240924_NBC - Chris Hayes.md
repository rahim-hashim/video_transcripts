# ‘This is really creepy’ Sen. Warren eviscerates Trump’s message to women voters
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q)
*  Donald Trump is having a tough time winning over very important and sizable voting block [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  women. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=4.48s)]
*  According to the latest NBC News polling, Vice President Kamala Harris holds a 21-point [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=5.48s)]
*  advantage over Trump with female voters, 58 to 37 percent. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=9.76s)]
*  Trump is also down 21 points on a key issue that matters to a lot of American women and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  men as well. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=18.68s)]
*  Fifty-four percent of registered voters say Kamala Harris would be better than Trump on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=19.68s)]
*  abortion rights. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=23.36s)]
*  She's up 21 points on that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=24.36s)]
*  Now the Republican nominee is trying to bridge this very serious gulf by basically telling [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=26.64s)]
*  women don't worry your pretty little heads. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=30.78s)]
*  We've got to end this national nightmare. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=33.4s)]
*  Because I am your protector. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=41.2s)]
*  I want to be your protector. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=42.64s)]
*  As president, I have to be your protector. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=43.88s)]
*  You will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=46.0s)]
*  You will no longer be in danger. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=49.64s)]
*  You're not going to be in danger any longer. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=54.96s)]
*  Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=61.22s)]
*  You will no longer be thinking about abortion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=70.92s)]
*  It's all they talk about, abortion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=73.4s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=75.52s)]
*  Senator, it's good to have you on the program. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=79.4s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, what do you think about this pitch that Donald Trump will be your protector? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=83.24s)]
*  He's talking to you as an American woman. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=89.08s)]
*  And he'll protect you so well that you just won't have to worry about all this politics [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=91.72s)]
*  stuff like abortion. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  This is really creepy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Really, I mean, this is just creepy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=100.44s)]
*  This has this, you will be happy and you will be happy doing exactly what Donald Trump [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=106.0s)]
*  and his extremist friends have decided that you are allowed to do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=113.32s)]
*  And you know, I have to say, it actually fits with a whole mindset of saying Donald Trump [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=119.4s)]
*  and an extremist branch in this country will decide who gets access to abortion, to IVF, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=127.4s)]
*  to contraception. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=135.12s)]
*  It's this, they will make the decisions and women, bless us, will simply say thank you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=137.32s)]
*  and be so happy about all of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, I just want to give them a little advice here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=147.72s)]
*  That isn't how we work. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=150.88s)]
*  Women actually want to stand up and make our own decisions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=153.6s)]
*  And if we consult people, we would like to be the ones to decide who we consult, that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=157.46s)]
*  It should not be the case that the government or really it's Donald Trump and a handful [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=163.46s)]
*  of extremists come in and decide our health care decisions and what kind of medical care [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=169.34s)]
*  that we will be able to receive. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=176.5s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=181.1s)]
*  It's just creepy, Chris. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=182.1s)]
*  Anthony Comstock, who after whom the Comstock Act is named, I think saw himself also as [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=183.82s)]
*  a protector of women. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=188.5s)]
*  That law, which essentially still in the books and thanks to the overturn of Roe by Trump's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=189.66s)]
*  court could be utilized by a Justice Department on day one as they call for in Project 2025 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=195.38s)]
*  to essentially criminalize abortion and contraception being mailed anywhere on the first day without [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=201.7s)]
*  Congress. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=206.54s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=207.54s)]
*  And remember, J.D. Vance has already written a letter to the Department of Justice telling [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=209.18s)]
*  the Department of Justice to get out there and enforce the Comstock Act and take away [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  access to abortion to every person in this country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=221.66s)]
*  No more access at all. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=226.78s)]
*  And you know, this is the reminder, obviously, why we need Kamala Harris in the White House, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  but also why we need Democratic control of Congress and particularly Democratic control [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=236.06s)]
*  of the Senate. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=243.58s)]
*  You're covering the races here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  I am so glad you are about this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=246.89999999999998s)]
*  But this is really the moment. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  Look at what's going on around the country where more and more people are standing up [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=250.94s)]
*  and saying, I care about the abortion issue. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=256.18s)]
*  I care about being able to make my decision or letting women make their decisions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=258.5s)]
*  This is going to be on the ballot down in Florida. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  And it means that that Senate race is in direct contention. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=267.64s)]
*  You're looking for a race that you want to say where's a possible pickup for Democrats. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=271.24s)]
*  It's going to be in a place like Florida where people are coming to the polls to be able [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=276.48s)]
*  to vote to say, we want access to abortion. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=282.38s)]
*  And while we're here, we'd like to have a Democratic senator who actually would help [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=286.32s)]
*  Kamala Harris put a law in place that makes sure there is no Comstock Act and that some [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=292.44s)]
*  Republican president on his own in the future cannot just wave his wand and get rid of access [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=300.66s)]
*  to abortion. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=307.12s)]
*  I want to ask you a question about a Senate candidate, Bernie Moreno, who's running against [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=308.74s)]
*  your colleague, Sheridan Brown in Ohio. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=311.8s)]
*  And he said this thing at a town call, which I want to play for you, which I think is actually [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=315.22s)]
*  widely shared among the Republicans, which is a kind of like head scratching, like what's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=318.36s)]
*  up with these broads and all their obsession with the abortion thing? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=323.24s)]
*  Why do they care so much? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=326.36s)]
*  And here he's talking about he doesn't quite get why women over 50 care about the issue. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=327.96s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=331.88s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=332.88s)]
*  You know, the left has a lot of single issue voters. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=333.88s)]
*  Sadly, by the way, there's a lot of suburban women. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=336.88s)]
*  A lot of suburban women, they're like, listen, abortion's there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=339.88s)]
*  If I can't have an abortion in this country whenever I want, I will vote for anybody else. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=342.88s)]
*  Okay, a little crazy, by the way, but especially for women that are like past 50 of the US [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=347.88s)]
*  office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=353.88s)]
*  It's an issue for you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=354.88s)]
*  What do you think of that one? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=358.8s)]
*  I so this is the plan to win votes from women. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=361.8s)]
*  Look, as I understand it, the people of Ohio have spoken on the question of abortion and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=367.8s)]
*  they voted on this last year and they came together and said by pretty large majority [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=376.36s)]
*  that they want to have access to abortion and that they really don't want to go down this [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=381.92s)]
*  path of having the government make their decisions for them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=387.64s)]
*  But but it really is. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=390.64s)]
*  To me, this is all of the same mindset about people like Donald Trump just saying that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=392.64s)]
*  they're the ones who are going to make this decision and patting sweet little women on [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=399.64s)]
*  the head and telling us we're all going to be happy with whatever it is that they decide. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=403.64s)]
*  Newsflash, we're not going to be happy about it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=410.64s)]
*  And in fact, we're not going to go along with it at all. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=414.52s)]
*  That's why I think that we are backing up Kamala Harris and we are backing up Democratic [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=417.52s)]
*  control of the Senate and backing up Democratic control of the House, because that combination [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=422.52s)]
*  is literally the only possible way that we can protect access to abortion, protect access [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=429.52s)]
*  to IVF all across this country. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=437.52s)]
*  So yes, yes, yes, we got to help Kamala, but we also have to help our Republicans in the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=441.4s)]
*  Senate. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=448.4s)]
*  Like I said, Florida may be a pickup opportunity. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=449.4s)]
*  Texas is looking like a pickup opportunity and defending our Democrats who are fighting [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=452.4s)]
*  right now to hang on to their Senate seats. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=457.4s)]
*  That is our pathway to protect access to abortion in red states and blue states, because those [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=460.4s)]
*  Republicans are making clear they're coming for everything. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=467.4s)]
*  They want to ban abortion nationwide. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  This is our chance to fight back. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  I should note Colin Allred, who's the Democratic candidate in Texas, and Debbie Mucarsill-Powell [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  is a Democratic candidate running against incumbent Rick Scott in Florida, just so folks [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  know those names. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren, always great to have you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWpOxxhfG1Q&t=500.4s)]
