# Conservative lawyers argue Trump is legally disqualified from holding office
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc)
*  Before Donald Trump, the last time that American politicians attempted to subvert the elected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=0.0s)]
*  government and unleash violence in response to an election was of course the Civil War. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=4.64s)]
*  And in the wake of that, the founders of the post-Civil War Republic, the framers [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=9.36s)]
*  of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, were quite preoccupied with the fact that those who fomented [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=14.08s)]
*  bloody insurrection and rebellion against the country should be disqualified from future office. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=20.8s)]
*  In fact, they were so concerned with it, they wrote it into the United States Constitution, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=26.48s)]
*  as Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=31.52s)]
*  Now, two conservative law professors, self-professed originalists, have published a law review article [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=48.32s)]
*  arguing that, quote, if the public record is accurate, the case is not even close. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=54.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is no longer eligible to the office of the presidency or any other state or federal [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  office covered by the Constitution. One of the people who's been working on this issue, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=65.68s)]
*  Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, Noah Bookbinder, president and CEO of Citizens for Responsibility [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=70.8s)]
*  and Ethics in Washington, or a crew, and he joins me now. Noah, it's great to have you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=76.16s)]
*  First, just tell us what you were able to do, because you brought a suit under this, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  part of the 14th Amendment, that was successful, and I think the first time that it's happened in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  many, many years. Tell us about that suit. Yeah, that's right. So we represented residents [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=95.28s)]
*  of New Mexico who brought a lawsuit to remove from office and disqualify from future office. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=102.32s)]
*  A guy named Cui Griffin, who was a county commissioner in New Mexico, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=109.76s)]
*  he was the founder of a group called Cowboys for Trump, and he was someone who was on the steps [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  of the Capitol on January 6th. He helped to recruit people to the Capitol on that day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  He encouraged violence and insurrection. He normalized that violence, even though he was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=126.0s)]
*  not personally violent. And we were able to convince a court that January 6th was an [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=130.88s)]
*  insurrection for the purpose of the 14th Amendment, the first court to find that, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  and to disqualify Mr. Griffin from office as the first time in over 150 years that a court had [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  disqualified someone under the 14th Amendment. So that's incredibly significant in showing that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  this is a living piece of the Constitution that applies as much now as it ever has. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=155.36s)]
*  How did the lawsuit work? How did you sue him? And in which court? And how did you bring it? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=164.08s)]
*  Yeah, so in New Mexico, there is a law, and a lot of states have these laws, that basically say that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  citizens can go to court if there is a person who is not qualified to serve in the office [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=177.52s)]
*  in which they're serving. And so the case went to state court in New Mexico. A judge heard evidence, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=185.36s)]
*  there were witnesses, and considered the evidence, considered Mr. Griffin's defense, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  and made this decision. And it would be, it will be, because we have every intention, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  we are preparing to take action to remove Donald Trump from ballots under this provision, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=204.32s)]
*  a similar kind of provision to show that he is not qualified to be on the ballot for president [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=210.32s)]
*  because the Constitution says that he cannot serve. So that's the big question. You've got [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=217.28s)]
*  a law review article, you've got the plain reading of the text, which I think is a plausible case. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=221.68s)]
*  How would it even work at the federal level? What would be the actual legal mechanics by which [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=227.12s)]
*  this law would be rendered real with respect to Donald Trump? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=233.12s)]
*  So obviously we're on ground that hasn't been tilled in a very, very long time. But [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  every state has laws and has procedures for who is qualified to be on a ballot. So for instance, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=246.48s)]
*  if, and this has happened, if a 31-year-old runs for president, the Constitution says you have to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=255.04s)]
*  be 35. And the procedure is a little different in different states, but a citizen can go to court [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=260.64s)]
*  and say, this person's not qualified. And the court will hold an evidentiary hearing, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=268.0s)]
*  look at the evidence, and make that determination. Also, a secretary of state, the chief election [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  officer in a state, can make that determination themselves. They can say, again, this person's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=279.76s)]
*  32 years old, they can't be president, so we're going to take them off the ballot. The same thing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=286.0s)]
*  applies here. Even if the stakes seem a lot higher, it's really the same kind of qualification [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=290.32s)]
*  from the Constitution. Yeah. Krew, for whom you work, has written that section three's text and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=297.2s)]
*  historical applications make clear that a criminal charge or conviction is not necessary for a person [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=303.44s)]
*  to be adjudged as qualified. Section three can be adjudicated through civil lawsuits. And with respect [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=308.48s)]
*  to presidential candidates, the disqualification clause can be enforced by, as you said, state [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=313.28s)]
*  election officials and in state courts as part of the process for determining who can appear on [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=318.24s)]
*  ballots for presidential elections. Final quick question for you. You got to do it ahead of time, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=322.56s)]
*  though, right? You can't do it after. It's got to be this question of, can they appear on the ballot [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=326.56s)]
*  as a front-end question? That's right. I mean, you can go to try to remove someone from office [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=332.0s)]
*  once they're in office, but that's obviously a much more explosive situation to end up in. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=338.56s)]
*  When you have someone who shouldn't be qualified, you ought to get in there soon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=343.76s)]
*  That's what we intend to do. And we hope that, and we trust that courts and that election officials [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  will follow the Constitution. This is a real sleeper issue that we're going to stay on, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=355.28s)]
*  because I think it could be quite explosive as it proceeds. Noah Bookbinder, thank you very much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=359.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOksxijRSc&t=373.76s)]
