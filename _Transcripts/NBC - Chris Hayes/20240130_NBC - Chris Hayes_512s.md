# Meet the woman who secretly taped Trump saying, ‘I need 11,000 votes’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs)
*  They're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad, whether you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=0.0s)]
*  know it or not, they're laughing at you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And you've taken a state that's a Republican state, and you've made it almost impossible [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=9.58s)]
*  for a Republican to win because of cheating. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=14.44s)]
*  So look, all I want to do is this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=17.12s)]
*  I just want to find 11,780 votes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=19.88s)]
*  So what are we going to do here, folks? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=28.04s)]
*  I only need 11,000 votes, fellas. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  I need 11,000 votes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=31.8s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  It's been just over three years since the infamous phone call in which Donald Trump [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=35.2s)]
*  pushed the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to, quote, flip the state electoral [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=38.8s)]
*  results by finding those votes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Since then, Trump has been indicted by Fulton County, Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=46.64s)]
*  Fonny Willis, along with 18 others in a wide ranging racketeering case. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=50.92s)]
*  Now, so far, four of those co-conspirators, you see them there, I'm taking guilty, please. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=56.36s)]
*  But if or when Donald Trump sees the inside of a court himself, at least in Fulton County, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=61.68s)]
*  is very much up in the air. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=66.04s)]
*  Joining us now is Michael Isikoff. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=68.12s)]
*  He's the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News, co-author of the new book on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=69.12s)]
*  Trump's attempts to steal the election in Georgia titled Find Me the Votes, a hard-charging [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=73.72s)]
*  Georgia prosecutor, a rogue president in the plot to steal an American election, which [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=78.4s)]
*  is out today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=82.4s)]
*  Great to have you here, Michael. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=83.4s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=84.4s)]
*  Let's start on the Fonny Willis stuff happening right now, which is, I'm not quite sure what [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=86.44s)]
*  to make of it, and I don't need to, there's both sort of establishing the factual record, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=91.48s)]
*  which seems a little opaque still, whether there was any impropriety, and then fundamentally [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=96.4s)]
*  if there's like a legal issue that will affect the case. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  What's your reason? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  So look, my co-author, Dan Kleiman, and I spent a lot of time talking to Fonny Willis. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  We had multiple interviews. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=110.44s)]
*  We spent hours talking to her and people around her. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=111.76s)]
*  She is unquestionably a talented prosecutor. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=114.62s)]
*  She was the star litigator in the Fulton County District Attorney's Office for years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  And she's extremely a talented, a professional attorney, but she's made some missteps here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  We talk in the book about one of them when she sponsored a fundraiser for a friend of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  hers who was running against one of the targets of the investigation that led to the judge [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=139.82s)]
*  saying, what do you think? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=143.86s)]
*  This was a what were you thinking moment. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=144.86s)]
*  It's fair to say the Nathan Wade relationship is another what were you thinking moment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  It was a misjudgment and a mistake by her. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=152.34s)]
*  I think she'll acknowledge that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=155.72s)]
*  But that said, taking a step back, let's remember this had absolutely no impact on the case [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=157.94s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=164.22s)]
*  It didn't deny any defendants their constitutional rights. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=165.22s)]
*  It didn't show prejudice in the bringing in any aspect of the case. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=167.42s)]
*  She's going to file a response this Friday. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=173.78s)]
*  I'm expecting a quite vigorous response in which she will challenge at least some of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  the allegations out there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  And we'll see where it's settled. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=184.42s)]
*  But I'll be surprised if the judge, Judge McAfee, ends up granting this motion or disqualifying [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=185.82s)]
*  her for simply the lack of any impact on the case at all. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=192.5s)]
*  That seems the sort of threshold is a legal issue in terms of the case, in terms of her [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=197.22s)]
*  removal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=201.22s)]
*  One of the fascinating bits of reporting in your book is about the actual person that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  recorded that infamous phone call. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=207.34s)]
*  A phone call that I have to say, even as we played it just now, is shocking every time [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=209.38s)]
*  you hear it because it is so over the line, even as it pretends to not be over the line. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  Find me the votes, flip it, the cheating. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=220.94s)]
*  Tell me about who the person is that recorded that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=223.74s)]
*  This is one of the unheralded stories of the 2020 election battle. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=225.62s)]
*  Just to set the stage here, Brad Raffensperger was the secretary of state. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=232.74s)]
*  Trump and his team are adamant about pressuring Raffensperger to alter the results of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  election. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=244.58s)]
*  Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, contacts Raffensperger's chief of staff, a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=245.58s)]
*  young woman, 30-year-old Jordan Fuchs, Republican consultant, strategist who was hired as the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=251.74s)]
*  chief of staff and had been with Raffensperger through all the turmoil after the election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=256.74s)]
*  Just to be clear, just to set a context here, you're the chief of staff of the Georgia secretary [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=263.5s)]
*  of state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  You're not getting the president of the United States chief of staff calling you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  That's a big thing when that happens. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=270.82s)]
*  They were trying to contact Raffensperger repeatedly, but he didn't want to touch them [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  because they're in litigation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=277.86s)]
*  Trump is suing them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=279.82s)]
*  Jordan Fuchs knows the danger for Raffensperger to get on the phone with Donald Trump, who [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=283.3s)]
*  has a habit of distorting anything that would get said in that phone call. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=288.74s)]
*  She on her own makes the decision, unilateral decision, she's going to tape the call. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=293.62s)]
*  She's on the phone call, but you never hear her voice. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=301.36s)]
*  She put herself on mute. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=303.8s)]
*  She didn't tell Raffensperger she was taping it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=305.3s)]
*  She didn't tell Meadows she was taping it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  She didn't tell Trump that she was taking it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=310.1s)]
*  One problem that arose after the tape went wild is that she happened to be in Florida [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=312.54s)]
*  at the time, visiting her grandparents, and Florida is a two-party consent state. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=321.86s)]
*  She was risking potential criminal prosecution in Florida. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=329.8s)]
*  I don't think that's ever going to happen because among other things, there's an exemption [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=335.82s)]
*  for law enforcement, and the Secretary of State's office is a law enforcement agency. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=339.46s)]
*  The bottom line here is she's never spoken about this, but she did when called before [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=343.46s)]
*  the grand jury, was given immunity, and acknowledged she taped the call. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=348.7s)]
*  It was the single, gutsiest, and most consequential act of the entire post-election battle. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=353.94s)]
*  It's all because this one young woman, Republican consultant, on her own, made the decision [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=362.22s)]
*  to do it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=367.82000000000005s)]
*  Thirty-year-old Chief of Staff, she's in Orlando, her grandparents. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=368.82000000000005s)]
*  In the moment, she decided she would protect the boss, Raffensperger. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=372.66s)]
*  When the White House witchered, patched the president's shoe, she put herself on mute [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  without telling Raffensperger or Meadows. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=378.22s)]
*  She taped the call, which is why we have that infamous call. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=380.04s)]
*  One of the other aspects you're reporting, I think, is really crucial is the security [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=382.92s)]
*  story around Funnywells. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=387.62s)]
*  The reason it's so crucial is we know and I know anyone who comes into Trump's crosshairs [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=389.16s)]
*  faces an enormous security problem. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=394.36s)]
*  Often they can't and don't want to talk about it that much publicly because it doesn't really [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=397.6s)]
*  help your security problem. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=401.8s)]
*  You do some real reporting on what Funnywells' life looks like now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=403.62s)]
*  It was pretty horrendous, far worse than anybody knew. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=407.5s)]
*  Look, Trump was riling up his people throughout this entire investigation, calling her a Marxist, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  a radical, a racist, anything that would get people riled up to attack her. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=419.2s)]
*  And she's getting subjected to these just awful threats against her, against her family. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=423.76s)]
*  We talk about one computer-disguised call to her cell phone in which the guy is bringing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=430.92s)]
*  up her daughters and saying he knows where they live and they're in danger. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=439.38s)]
*  This is a phone call on her personal cell phone. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=443.68s)]
*  The caller started talking about Willis' two daughters. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=445.68s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=447.92s)]
*  Okay, let's cut to what I think is one of the most dramatic stories of this whole saga. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=448.92s)]
*  The night of the indictment, she announces it at a midnight press conference and they [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  just learn that there was an assassination threat. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=457.48s)]
*  The best time to shoot her is when she leaves the building. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  Funnywells goes back to her office, takes off her business suit, this is after the press [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=463.04s)]
*  conference, takes off her pearls, puts on sweats of the baseball cap and then a body [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  double, a body double puts on Willis' suit and leaves. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=473.2s)]
*  Willis is smuggled out the back of the building to an undisclosed location. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=478.56s)]
*  All that can be found in Finding the Votes, co-authored by Michael Isikoff and Daniel [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=484.44s)]
*  Klayman. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=488.48s)]
*  You can find that in bookstores and online right now. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=489.48s)]
*  Michael, thank you so much. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsyt8fBxCqs&t=490.8s)]
