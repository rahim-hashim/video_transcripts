# ‘Where was the president?’ Hayes on Trump’s alarming absence amid war plans group chat
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs)
*  Do you still believe nothing classified was shared? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I've heard. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=4.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=5.44s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=6.44s)]
*  You have to ask the various people involved. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=7.44s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=8.76s)]
*  What it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=9.76s)]
*  that was with Mike Waltz, worked for Mike Waltz at a lower level, had, I guess, Goldberg's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=14.84s)]
*  number called through the app. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=22.32s)]
*  And somehow this guy ended up on the call. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=25.96s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=28.16s)]
*  I guess he said he claimed responsibility, I would imagine, had nothing to do with anyone [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=29.4s)]
*  else. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  It was Mike, I guess. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  I always thought it was Mike. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Thanks to National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and his Houthi PC small group chat. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=40.2s)]
*  We've learned a lot this week about the ongoing U.S. military strikes in Yemen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=45.08s)]
*  We're also learning more about the various roles and locations of the members of that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  And just about how out of the loop the commander in chief is when major life and death decisions [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=54.32s)]
*  are being made in this administration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  Let's look at where all the major players were as this thing unfolded. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=62.24s)]
*  On March 11th, the day Waltz apparently mistakenly sent a connection request on the Signal app [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=65.68s)]
*  to a reporter, he was in Saudi Arabia for talks on the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=70.16s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio was also in Saudi Arabia, not just for the war negotiations, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=75.44s)]
*  but to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss ways to advance shared interests [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=79.48s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=84.28s)]
*  Around the same time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsath was in meetings in Washington [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=85.72s)]
*  at the CIA headquarters with Director John Ratcliffe. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=89.4s)]
*  And then there was Steve Wittkopf, the real estate investor who serves improbably as Trump's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Middle East envoy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=97.68s)]
*  On March 13th, Wittkopf was in Moscow as Russian state TV showed his motorcade leaving the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=99.68s)]
*  airport for meetings with Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  At some point during his day in Moscow, he was added to the group chat. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=107.96s)]
*  Even though just days before, the National Security Agency put out a bulletin warning [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=113.16s)]
*  of vulnerabilities in the Signal app saying Russian professional hacking groups were using [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=117.44s)]
*  those vulnerabilities to spy on encrypted conversations. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  Now Wittkopf says he didn't bring his phone on that trip. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=126.32s)]
*  That same day, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had just landed in Tokyo for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=130.5s)]
*  a multinational tour, but she couldn't recall where she was when she started receiving the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=135.32000000000002s)]
*  group text. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=139.84s)]
*  Director Gabbard, you were also traveling during this discussion, correct? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=142.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=146.0s)]
*  And where were you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=147.0s)]
*  I was traveling through the Asia Pacific region. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't recall which country I was in at that time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=151.84s)]
*  You don't remember the country? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=154.56s)]
*  I'd have to go back and look at the schedule. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=156.72s)]
*  The following day, March 14th, Vice President JD Vance was texting the group from an economic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=160.08s)]
*  meeting in Michigan, saying he had reservations about the war plan that he wasn't sure the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  president understood the full implications. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  Then came the day of the strike. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=172.64s)]
*  That afternoon, Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg was sitting in his car in a supermarket [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=174.88s)]
*  parking lot in the D.C. area, staring at his phone in disbelief. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  He was the reporter who had been added to the group chat by Michael Walz. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=184.72s)]
*  And now he read a summary of the war plan from Hegseth, who told the group text the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=188.64s)]
*  bombing would begin at 1 45 p.m. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=193.3s)]
*  At that moment, Hegseth texted F 18 fighter jets from an aircraft carrier, as well as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=197.26000000000002s)]
*  C based Tomahawk missiles and unmanned drones from an unknown base in the region, by the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  way, were headed for targets in Yemen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  The Pentagon hasn't shared much information on its attacks there beyond saying that more [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  than 30 targets were hit on the first day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=213.68s)]
*  The Houthis say those strikes killed 53 people, including women and children. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=216.62s)]
*  Remember, according to Hegseth in the group text, a high value target was struck in his [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=222.7s)]
*  girlfriend's apartment building, which was completely collapsed by the U.S. missiles. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=227.98s)]
*  Vance replied to that text with the single word, excellent. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  You might be asking yourself, as all this was happening, where was the president? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=239.3s)]
*  The commander in chief of the United States forces, the man who's meant to make the final [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=243.54s)]
*  decision to launch a strike? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=247.4s)]
*  Well, he was in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=248.9s)]
*  His motorcade was recorded slipping into the gates of the Trump International Golf Club, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=251.7s)]
*  which features two golf courses with 27 holes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=256.5s)]
*  Today, the White House released photos of Trump still in his golf attire, wearing a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=259.94s)]
*  hat with his own signature on it, apparently listening in on the Yemen attack. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=263.86s)]
*  None of this is how the American chain of command usually functions or the way that's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=270.94s)]
*  supposed to work, a way that has worked through, I think, multiple administrations of both parties. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=274.5s)]
*  The national security principals don't text. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=279.58s)]
*  They bring the recommendations to the president, who then makes a clear and unambiguous decision [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=281.82s)]
*  about the most consequential thing you can do as president to risk the lives of American [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=287.18s)]
*  service members in an operation that will kill other people, including in this case, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  it appears, many civilians who had the misfortune of just to be living in a building that we [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=297.58s)]
*  collapsed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=303.74s)]
*  I mean, everyone knows this from every movie you've ever seen, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=304.74s)]
*  The go or no go, green light or not, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=308.1s)]
*  You wait, the president gives a thumbs up or not. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=309.94s)]
*  And it's obvious to all, thanks to these texts, the core thing that was supposed to happen [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=312.98s)]
*  in these decision-making procedures clearly did not happen. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  Instead, everything seemed to go backwards. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=322.1s)]
*  Trump wanted action, and then his underlings tried to divine what he really wanted. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=325.18s)]
*  Like when Vance texted the gang in the morning, the strikes quote, I think we're making a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=330.06s)]
*  mistake. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=333.62s)]
*  The strongest reason to do this, as POTUS said, is to send a message, but I am not sure [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=334.62s)]
*  the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=337.86s)]
*  Minutes later, Hegseth responded, quote, we are prepared to execute. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=343.86s)]
*  And if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=347.82s)]
*  But the thing is, he doesn't get that final vote. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=352.1s)]
*  The president does. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=354.14s)]
*  And then within minutes of that text, Waltz, who created the group, he adds in SM. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=355.98s)]
*  That was Trump's White House aide, Stephen Miller, who then weighed in saying, as I heard [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=361.58s)]
*  it, the president was clear, green light. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=366.06s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=370.54s)]
*  As I heard it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=371.74s)]
*  He wasn't that clear if everyone's debating it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=373.94s)]
*  As I heard it, the president was clear. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=376.5s)]
*  Couldn't have been that clear if you have to say as I heard it and people are debating [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=377.86s)]
*  what he said. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=380.54s)]
*  And apparently there's no asking the president what he meant in the face-to-face meetings [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=381.54s)]
*  of the principals meeting. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=385.02s)]
*  No getting the commander in chief to clearly state what he wants American service members [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=387.86s)]
*  to do, just a bunch of people on a text chain trying to guess what the boss wants. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=392.66s)]
*  As I heard it, he was clear. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  Was he clear? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=398.18s)]
*  And then the arguments ended by a guy who's close to the president saying, I'm pretty [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=400.86s)]
*  sure this is what he meant. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  This is just a colossal failure of everyone up to and including the president. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CBClbiGlOs&t=406.68s)]
