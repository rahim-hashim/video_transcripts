# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Feb. 23
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE)
*  The warning lights are blinking red on the fascist intent of a second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=0.0s)]
*  And it is not an abstract threat. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=6.0s)]
*  There are people, Americans, who literally fear Trump's retribution, just as he loudly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=8.28s)]
*  promises at rallies if he's reelected. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=13.52s)]
*  One of those people is retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a key witness in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=16.84s)]
*  the first impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=22.12s)]
*  He flagged Trump's 2019 perfect phone call, where Trump pressured the president of Ukraine [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=24.42s)]
*  to open an investigation into his chief political rival, Joe Biden. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=30.14s)]
*  But now, as NBC News reports, Colonel Vindman's wife is so worried about Trump's return to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=34.42s)]
*  the White House that she doesn't want to celebrate her 50th birthday next month because the family [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=40.02s)]
*  might need the money in case they have to flee the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=45.38s)]
*  A country, by the way, Colonel Vindman volunteered to defend and serve very honorably. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=48.94s)]
*  Colonel Vindman is the former director for European Affairs for the National Security Council. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=55.18s)]
*  He is currently a senior advisor to vote vets, and he joins me now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=60.46s)]
*  Colonel, it's so good to see you, my friend. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=64.5s)]
*  I hope you're doing well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=66.3s)]
*  One of the things that we hear a lot is the hyperbolic, if so and so is elected, right, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=68.38s)]
*  if so and so is elected, I'm leaving the country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=77.06s)]
*  You told NBC that you don't plan to leave, but regardless, this hyperbolic, excited state, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=78.54s)]
*  this isn't just hyperbole for you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=86.38s)]
*  This is a real concern. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  Tell us about those family concerns that you and your wife have. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=91.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=94.1s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=95.1s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=96.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, my wife and I have a slight difference of opinion here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=97.1s)]
*  It's probably because my daughter classifies me as responsible for fun. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=101.66s)]
*  My wife responsible for safety. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  So she thinks about the what ifs, the worst case scenarios. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=108.9s)]
*  I think about how to keep Trump out of office, how to avoid this worst case scenario, not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=112.58000000000001s)]
*  for me, not for the scores of other folks on Trump's enemies list, but the millions [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=118.42s)]
*  of Americans that would suffer through a second administration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=123.98s)]
*  For her, it does end up being a real concern. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=127.5s)]
*  She wants to understand what our situation would be if Donald Trump is the chief executive [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  responsible for the IRS and directs the IRS to conduct unlawful investigations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=139.1s)]
*  She wants to know if he uses federal law enforcement to pursue his enemies or if he just issues [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=145.62s)]
*  instructions to his sycophantic followers to seek retribution against folks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  For me, again, I'm laser focused on making sure that person never sees the Oval Office [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=158.38s)]
*  again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=164.66s)]
*  Again, more so for the country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=165.66s)]
*  For me, I'm not intimidated. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=169.06s)]
*  I'm out there prepared to fight him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=170.78s)]
*  But that's a real threat, I guess, to scores of Americans that have made his list. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=174.74s)]
*  You have been very, very strong in your view on this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=182.1s)]
*  And in fact, you've been more than sensitive to the threats and the difficulties presented [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=187.77999999999997s)]
*  by Trump and a lot of his minions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=193.54s)]
*  You had a message for your father, as I recall, during your impeachment testimony. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=195.66s)]
*  And I wanted to play just a little bit of that so folks can hear what you said to your dad. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=199.54s)]
*  Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=205.54s)]
*  that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=211.42s)]
*  to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=215.94s)]
*  Do not worry. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=220.62s)]
*  I'll be fine for telling the truth. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=221.62s)]
*  And that's always the bottom line, isn't it, Colonel? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=224.62s)]
*  Telling the truth. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=227.06s)]
*  And you wear that badge in particular very well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=228.06s)]
*  Does all of this that's going on now, the elevation of this, are those concerns still [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=232.7s)]
*  there for your dad and other family members? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  And what do you say to them? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=240.44s)]
*  Not just the conversations you have with your wife and your immediate family, but your family [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=242.06s)]
*  and friends who are also concerned about you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  I think there are concerns. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=250.4s)]
*  My dad, of course, is still concerned. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=253.0s)]
*  He's turning 92 this year. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=255.08s)]
*  He's very clear-eyed about what the kind of leadership that he experienced in the Soviet [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=257.72s)]
*  Union and how that could manifest here in the United States. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=265.06s)]
*  For me, what I try to do is I try to raise the alarm. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=268.06s)]
*  And this should sound alarming to the American public. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=271.84s)]
*  The threat of MAGA, the threat of Trump, is real. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=275.08s)]
*  It is not a threat in the distant future, November, or if he gets seated again in January. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=279.12s)]
*  Donald Trump invited Vladimir Putin to attack NATO. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=285.3s)]
*  I would say that that probably was a contributing factor in the calculus around the assassination [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=290.46s)]
*  of Navalny. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=295.5s)]
*  These stories now coming out of Moldova and the idea of a referendum in that country to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=297.56s)]
*  join the Russian Federation, that is a testing of the waters. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=303.84s)]
*  That is a signal that Russia is ready to be more aggressive because it has a sense of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=308.42s)]
*  impunity. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=314.52s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=315.52s)]
*  Because Trump is not just the likely Republican nominee. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=316.52s)]
*  He's the head of the Republican Party. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=322.16s)]
*  He issues marching orders to Speaker Johnson. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=324.0s)]
*  He issues marching orders to this radical MAGA political establishment that is now the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=327.48s)]
*  Republican House. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=333.34s)]
*  And that signals that absolute paralysis, not passing Ukraine aid, not taking severe [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=335.34s)]
*  actions against Putin and his regime. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=343.26s)]
*  That's a signal to either... [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=347.18s)]
*  It's an invitation is the way Putin sees it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=349.62s)]
*  That's what I really contend with on a regular basis. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  That's what I want to make sure the American public is aware of. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=355.2s)]
*  Select this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=358.92s)]
*  We don't have a second Trump administration. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=359.92s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, your words are a sharp reminder, particularly as [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  we recognize we're going into the second year of this invasion by Russia and Ukraine and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=367.8s)]
*  appreciate your service then and your service now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=374.92s)]
*  On the country in key battleground states, the Republican Party is on the verge of imploding. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=379.92s)]
*  Republicans unfettered loyalty to Donald Trump has led to disintegration and rot within local [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=385.1s)]
*  leadership which is now playing out in some very wild battles for control. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=389.98s)]
*  The most dramatic of these is happening in Michigan where Trump loyalist and election [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=395.16s)]
*  denier Christina Caramo was recently ousted as chair of the state party and replaced by [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  former ambassador Pete Hoekstra. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=406.48s)]
*  Due to her election denying self, Caramo is refusing to step down. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=408.82s)]
*  She retains control of the party's bank accounts which are reportedly near empty as well as [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=413.18s)]
*  their social media and email. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=418.54s)]
*  And she's planning to hold her own duly nominated convention next week. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=420.78s)]
*  So it is all chaos and confusion in what could be a bellwether state for Republicans this [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=425.4s)]
*  year. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=429.98s)]
*  Joining me now is Sala Nuzis, former chair of that Michigan Republican Party and a good [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=430.98s)]
*  friend, Saul Welcome. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=435.18s)]
*  I want to start with this AP report that talks about the Michigan GOP and how they [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=437.18s)]
*  got into this fundraising crisis. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  AP reports that the Michigan Republican Party was deep in debt when a long time party donor [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=444.5s)]
*  who had given more than a million dollars over the past decade asked for a meeting with [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=450.26s)]
*  Caramo. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=455.18s)]
*  She turned him down because he was, shall I say it, a rhino. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=456.86s)]
*  So you have a million dollar donor who says, hey, I want to help the party, chairman. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=462.48s)]
*  And she's like, well, I'm sorry, your money and go for me. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=468.88s)]
*  What's going on in Michigan? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's part of the problem. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  She ran kind of a populist campaign. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=475.6s)]
*  Ironically, one of the other people considering running was the co-chair of the party who [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=478.32s)]
*  was a very staunch Trump supporter. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=481.64000000000004s)]
*  But Caramo said she wasn't Trump enough. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  And so they wanted even more loyalists out there. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=488.22s)]
*  So they said they weren't going to talk to the major donors. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=490.68s)]
*  They wanted the grassroots to raise money. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=494.2s)]
*  And as all of us know, that's just physically impossible. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=496.12s)]
*  That's not the way you do things. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=498.8s)]
*  And so they turned down the state party building. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=500.36s)]
*  They couldn't afford to even pay for the expenses to keep the party open. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=502.8s)]
*  And so now they are basically bankrupt. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=507.48s)]
*  I don't think they have, if there's any money in the bank, it's very limited. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=509.2s)]
*  And there's no money to run any programs. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=513.44s)]
*  There's no money to assist candidates in running elections. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  These conventions are going to cost money. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=518.88s)]
*  They also are going to have problems there. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=520.24s)]
*  So I think that the party basically elected Ambassador Hoekstra, who I think will do a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=522.28s)]
*  very good job. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  I think he's got a relationship with the folks. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  But I don't know if we should say that because it might get him in trouble. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  But then you raise an interesting point about the convention, because the reality of it [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=534.52s)]
*  is you've got these two competing conventions coming up next week, where the state party, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=538.12s)]
*  the official party now recognized by the RNC and presumably by the courts next week, and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=544.28s)]
*  the current Karamo's effort are going to be happening at the same time. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=549.48s)]
*  You were, in my estimation, the last very successful chairman of that party. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=553.88s)]
*  You raised in a very short period of time a lot of money in presidential cycles. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=559.12s)]
*  When you're looking at these two conventions coming up, you're looking at the party that's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=565.6s)]
*  broke and you look at the fact that Michigan is still a key player in who the next president [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=569.08s)]
*  of the United States is going to be. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  What's your estimation? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  What would you say to the party activists and loyalists right now? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=577.0s)]
*  Well, look, I think the party is going to have to pull together. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=579.0s)]
*  This is not going to be an easy task. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=582.28s)]
*  There are very passionate people on both sides of the issue here. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=584.3599999999999s)]
*  But there's great opportunities in Michigan. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=587.9799999999999s)]
*  We've got a United States Senate seat up and we've got some very good candidates that are [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=589.64s)]
*  vying for the Republican nomination. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=593.04s)]
*  You have a presidential race that is very close with a very upset Arab-American community [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=595.04s)]
*  in Michigan, which makes up a large number of voters in Michigan that have traditionally [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=598.92s)]
*  voted Democrat. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=602.5799999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of factors that are coming together that could make this a very good [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=603.84s)]
*  year for Republicans in Michigan. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=606.92s)]
*  So they can lean into that fact that the Arab community there, which is one of the largest [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=608.42s)]
*  in the country, is very upset with the Biden administration. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=612.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=615.0s)]
*  And look, if you take a look at what's happened around the country, I mean, we've got Governor [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=616.0s)]
*  Kemp in Georgia. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  We have other people who actually ran outside and around the parties. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=620.68s)]
*  In the age of super PACs and C4s, et cetera, you don't necessarily need the party. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=624.4s)]
*  It's helpful. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=629.68s)]
*  There are things a party can do that other groups can't do. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=630.68s)]
*  But the reality is, I think you're finding, as these parties go off on the fringe, as [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=633.3399999999999s)]
*  these parties go into debt, as these parties basically try to do, you know, everyone who [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=636.9799999999999s)]
*  doesn't agree with them is a rhino, elections are about addition, not subtraction in this [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=643.38s)]
*  game. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=648.66s)]
*  I mean, we need every Republican to pull together if they're going to win an election. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=649.66s)]
*  And so these people are trying to exclude certain people and make it very difficult [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=654.9s)]
*  to win elections. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=658.3399999999999s)]
*  And that's going to be the challenge. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=659.3399999999999s)]
*  Before we, because I do want to talk to you about national popular vote, which is something [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=660.3399999999999s)]
*  you and I work very closely on. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=663.1s)]
*  Do you see this as a little bit of a bellwether was happening in Michigan, also playing out [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=665.82s)]
*  in other states, potentially like Arizona, where again, the state party chairman stepped [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=669.7s)]
*  down and you've got other types of issues, even in my home state of Maryland, we've got [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=673.5400000000001s)]
*  some issues. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=677.58s)]
*  Look, you've got the national party that's virtually bankrupt, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=678.58s)]
*  They don't have any money. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=680.7s)]
*  They're not raising money. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=681.7s)]
*  They have not been very successful in that regard. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=682.7s)]
*  You have at least three state parties, if not four, that are on the verge of bankruptcy, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=684.78s)]
*  if not having very serious financial problems. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=689.02s)]
*  This is probably the worst scenario I've seen in my lifetime with regards to what the state [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=691.6999999999999s)]
*  parties look like right now. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=696.5s)]
*  So I think there's some real challenges. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=697.7199999999999s)]
*  And as is always the case, it's going to be a function of a candidate stepping forward. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=700.06s)]
*  And I think that's where you see the post Trump era already being discussed by so many [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=705.26s)]
*  people like who are going to be the next candidates? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=709.6s)]
*  I mean, we'll probably have 15 to 20 people. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=711.9s)]
*  It's similar to what we had in 2016. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=714.62s)]
*  So you've got a whole different scenario coming around in that regard. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=717.02s)]
*  So how does the work that you're doing now in the national popular vote, which needs [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=719.44s)]
*  about what, 70? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=725.36s)]
*  65 now. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=726.36s)]
*  65 votes in the electoral college to come in law. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=727.36s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that very quickly and how the states can benefit from something [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=731.08s)]
*  like the national popular vote. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=735.24s)]
*  So the national popular vote, there's two different proposals. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=736.84s)]
*  One's a constitutional amendment to eliminate the electoral college, which is not what we [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=739.0s)]
*  support. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=742.2800000000001s)]
*  We basically are supporting a process that's called an interstate compact, which is an [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  agreement between the states to basically say when enough states join this compact, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=747.24s)]
*  they have 270 electoral votes or more. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=751.08s)]
*  They're going to vote as a block. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=753.4s)]
*  And that by definition will guarantee the presidency to whatever candidate wins the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=754.92s)]
*  most votes in a presidential election nationwide in all 50 states in the District of Columbia. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=759.52s)]
*  So it is a very realistic proposal that's passed 16 states plus the District of Columbia. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=764.1800000000001s)]
*  We are the most likely reform that I think would have a very large impact on how presidential [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=769.4s)]
*  candidates are run. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=773.6s)]
*  Look, four out of five Americans live in a state that is either decidedly Republican [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=774.96s)]
*  or decidedly Democrat. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=778.36s)]
*  And it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democratic candidate, you ignore those [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=779.36s)]
*  40, 42 states in every presidential election. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=782.96s)]
*  You know, we elect over 500,000 elected officials in this country, all of whom are elected by [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=785.12s)]
*  whoever gets the most votes but one. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  The one represents the country as a whole. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  So I think this is a reform that would be very healthy for the country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=793.4s)]
*  It preserves the electoral college and makes sure states continue to administer those elections. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=796.78s)]
*  And it strengthens the electoral college by making sure that all 50 states are participating, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=800.88s)]
*  that all 50 states matter, and campaigns will be forced into all 50 states. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=805.52s)]
*  So I think it's a good thing. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=808.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=809.16s)]
*  Well, I definitely want to get you back to talk. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=810.16s)]
*  I know Chris, this is an issue I think Chris Hayes would really kind of sink his teeth [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  into. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=815.68s)]
*  So I'm going to put the bug in, Nazir, to get you back on. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=816.68s)]
*  Solid Newses. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=818.8s)]
*  Thank you so much, my friend, for being with us. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=819.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QssJbYqrJCE&t=834.56s)]
