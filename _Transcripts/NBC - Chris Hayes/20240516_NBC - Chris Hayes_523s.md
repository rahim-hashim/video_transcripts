# GOP rep invokes Proud Boys at Trump trial 'Standing back and standing by'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM)
*  Today, Donald Trump had what appears to be his largest entourage yet at his criminal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=0.0s)]
*  trial in New York City. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=4.48s)]
*  Among them, nearly a dozen Republican members of Congress, including Matt Gaetz and Lauren [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=6.32s)]
*  Boeber. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=10.72s)]
*  And then there were hints of menace. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=11.72s)]
*  Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz tweeting a photo with the message, quote, standing back [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=13.56s)]
*  and standing by, Mr. President, the very same language Trump used in the first presidential [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  debate in 2020 when referencing the far-right group, the Proud Boys, a message that the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=23.32s)]
*  Proud Boys then took as marching orders in the lead up to January 6. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=28.48s)]
*  Also in the courthouse today, a key architect in the January 6 coup, Jeffrey Clark, the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=33.0s)]
*  former DOJ lawyer who was indicted in the Georgia case and also named as an unindicted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=37.24s)]
*  co-conspirator in the federal prosecution of Trump over the attempted coup. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=41.68s)]
*  Joining us now, Kyle Cheney, who was at the trial today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=46.08s)]
*  He is a senior legal affairs reporter for Politico with a focus on January 6. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=48.64s)]
*  And Andrew Weissman and Lisa Rubin are back with us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=53.52s)]
*  What a day for you to be in the room, given the way that this ties your expertise together. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=56.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was, you know, you see all these threads of the different Donald Trump related [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  investigations sort of coming together here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=65.08s)]
*  As you've talked about, this has become kind of a loyalty test for a lot of his allies. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=67.16s)]
*  And that has brought in people like Jeff Clark, who is not just an ally of Trump in the January [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=70.88s)]
*  6 period, but is charged with him in Georgia, an alleged co-conspirator and is an unnamed [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=75.48s)]
*  and unindicted co-conspirator in his Washington, D.C. case, too. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  So to see him sort of in the room as, again, a sort of a show of loyalty, I'm not even [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=83.84s)]
*  sure they're allowed to have contact under some of the release orders in those cases. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=88.12s)]
*  So it was interesting to see them in the same proximity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=91.8s)]
*  And to have Matt Gaetz saying standing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=93.52s)]
*  Bringing this very, very overt reference to the Proud Boys. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=96.88s)]
*  And again, I don't know what kind of loyalty that's supposed to demonstrate, but it was [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=99.72s)]
*  sort of a very brazen thing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=104.32s)]
*  And the picture that he put up with, it was him standing right behind Donald Trump in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=105.6s)]
*  the hallway. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  So it was sort of an unmistakable reference. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  Speaking of brazen rhetoric, Lisa, Donald Trump appeared to talk about one of the prosecutors [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=112.24s)]
*  in this trial today without naming him. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=116.96s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  We'll talk about it on the other side. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  A lead person from the D.R.J. is running the trial. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  So Biden's office is running this trial. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Not true. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=130.32s)]
*  Just to fact check that Biden is not running this trial. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=131.32s)]
*  What is he doing there? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  What he's really doing there is daring Judge Juan Marchand to put him in jail, because [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=136.16s)]
*  the last time that Donald Trump was penalized for violating the gag order, Judge Marchand [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  made it very clear to Donald Trump, you do this one more time and I have other remedies [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  at my disposal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  The statute only provides me with two. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  One is a fine of up to one thousand dollars for each violation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  The other is jail. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=156.88s)]
*  And I don't want to exercise the jail option. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=157.88s)]
*  It would be inconvenient. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=159.88s)]
*  It would be disruptive to the administration of justice. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  But I will if I have to. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=164.48s)]
*  And it almost seemed like Donald Trump was daring him to do it just to throw a bomb into [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=166.0s)]
*  the proceeding as it reaches its inevitable conclusion. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=171.2s)]
*  We didn't hear from the D.A. today on it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  We haven't seen the full transcript yet, so it's possible they mentioned it at a sidebar. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  But so far in open court, the district attorney's office has not said to Judge Marchand this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=180.76s)]
*  counts as a violation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=185.16s)]
*  That doesn't mean that they won't. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  And on Monday or beyond, we might hear from the D.A.'s office that while they don't want [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=188.16s)]
*  this to interfere with the rest of the trial, it's possible that they'll say to the judge [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=192.56s)]
*  as it reaches its conclusion, hey, this happened while the jury is out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=196.76s)]
*  Now it's time for you to take some action. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=201.32s)]
*  It's the challenge for the D.A., which is you described this as being a distraction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=202.88s)]
*  And there are so many distractions when you're talking about Donald Trump that is part of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=207.2s)]
*  his entire theory of the case. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=211.0s)]
*  So they are weighing, do we derail a case that is on its way to its conclusion or do [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=213.12s)]
*  we deal with the fact he's clearly once again not playing by the rules? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=222.92s)]
*  And in addition to the statement that you played, there is at least some evidence that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=223.42s)]
*  the sort of mini-me's who are auditioning for the vice president, presumably because [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=228.48s)]
*  they also want to be people who will be hung out to dry like Vice President Pence. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=234.32s)]
*  I mean, it's like there's nobody thinks about what happened to that person. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  Those people, it's not like they're just saying something that's unscripted. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=246.32s)]
*  There's reporting that we have reported on that Donald Trump was editing what it is that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=250.72s)]
*  they were supposed to say, which is again another violation of the gag order. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=256.08s)]
*  And to tie it back to Michael Cohen that we've been talking about, Michael Cohen, when he [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=260.28s)]
*  testified before Congress and was being attacked by Republicans in his testimony, he said, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=264.04s)]
*  look, I know what you're doing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=268.96s)]
*  I used to be you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=270.36s)]
*  I mean, I used to do that for Donald Trump. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=271.84s)]
*  And I'm telling you, it's like a fool's errand. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=274.4s)]
*  And so you're seeing this again with people who are thinking, oh, now I can be the vice [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=277.24s)]
*  president. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=280.72s)]
*  And look what Vice President Pence is, one, what happened to him on January 6th. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=281.72s)]
*  And two, it's remarkable that you have a vice president, a former vice president who is [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=287.2s)]
*  not actually endorsing the person he was serving as president. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=291.2s)]
*  What I think about what it was that Matt Gaetz tweeted out, all I can think of is the fact [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=295.72s)]
*  that in so many ways they are creating a permission structure for future violence, whether that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  is related to the outcome of this court case, whether that is related to the outcome of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=306.16s)]
*  the election, that they see 1-6 as a precursor, as a preamble to whatever is coming next, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=310.64s)]
*  not simply something that is in the past that has been reckoned with. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=316.92s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of the forces that led to January 6th are still present in our politics. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=319.64s)]
*  And I think that the outcome of some of these cases and whether the justice system is up [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=324.48s)]
*  to the task of holding the former president accountable, whether these cases even get [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=329.8s)]
*  tried at all, that's really the question right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=335.24s)]
*  And regardless of the outcome, to not have them hanging over this election process is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=338.0s)]
*  a live issue. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=344.2s)]
*  And I think that we don't, I think whatever happens there is going to be telling about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=345.32s)]
*  the direction of the country. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=351.16s)]
*  Can you help me understand, Lisa, given the amount of time that you have spent in that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=352.16s)]
*  courtroom, how it is that people get into that courtroom, how they get seated and what [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=356.0s)]
*  it tells you that he has about a dozen folks? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=360.32s)]
*  I am so glad that you asked me this question because today on the record from the DA's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=363.56s)]
*  office they basically said, hey, you had a bunch of surrogates for the former president [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  who came in at an awkward moment. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  They were basically disruptive of the cross-examination. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=375.24s)]
*  They came in at a time that members of the public wouldn't be allowed to come in and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  out. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  Could you ask them to stop doing that? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  And Todd Blanche, for his part, said, one, I don't control these people. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  Two, they're members of the public. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=386.96s)]
*  Let's accept his first proposition that he doesn't, he, Todd Blanche, as a member of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=389.08s)]
*  the legal team, doesn't control them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=392.72s)]
*  The proposition that they are members of the public is simply belied by what we can see. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=394.92s)]
*  They do not come in the same public courthouse entry that Andrew and Kyle and I come in every [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  day. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  From what we can tell, they are transported with the former president. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  They are admitted into his bubble by the Secret Service. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  Whether they undergo additional security at that back entrance to the courthouse from [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  which Trump enters is not clear to us. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  What I can tell you is this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=419.68s)]
*  They enter the courthouse through the president's holding room, which we understand is an additional [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=421.1s)]
*  courtroom that's been cleared. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=426.12s)]
*  They come out with him as he makes the statements to the press in the hallway, and then they [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=427.62s)]
*  enter the courtroom with him in this bizarre procession that almost resembles a militaristic [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  parade. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a long line, almost in a hierarchical order of importance of who comes in with him, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  the legal team, the aides, members of Congress, et cetera, to call them members of the public [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=441.44s)]
*  akin to the guy that you showed on tape earlier who had been waiting in line for hours and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=447.12s)]
*  hours. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=452.52s)]
*  That's just simply not an apt or fair comparison. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=453.52s)]
*  And I want to say one other thing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=456.4s)]
*  Matt Gaetz might be making statements that make our jaws drop, and Donald Trump might [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=458.32s)]
*  be violating the gag order, but some of these people don't have to say a word. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=462.76s)]
*  And that's because from where they are sitting, each of the witnesses is marched directly [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=465.72s)]
*  in front of the first row of Trump observers. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=470.68s)]
*  Each side, meaning the prosecution and the defense, has the first two rows of the gallery [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=473.56s)]
*  in the courtroom. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=477.1s)]
*  That means if you're Michael Cohen this morning, who did you walk by? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=478.12s)]
*  Eric Trump. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  As you are trying to get into the courtroom to your seat, you're not walking down the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=482.6s)]
*  center aisle of the courtroom as we see in so many procedural dramas, but rather in a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=486.76s)]
*  separate entrance designed to maximize your security and your protection from the remainder [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=491.4s)]
*  of the public given what is going on here and how controversial it is with some members [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=496.46s)]
*  of the public. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=501.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIfUFiQh9qM&t=503.56s)]
