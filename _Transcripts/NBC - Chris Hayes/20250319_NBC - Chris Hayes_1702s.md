# FULL INTERVIEW: Chuck Schumer joins Chris Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4)
*  I'm joined now by New York Senator and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, whose new book, Anti-Semitism [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=0.0s)]
*  in America, a Warning, is out this very day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  It is available wherever you go. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=7.36s)]
*  It's upside down. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=8.36s)]
*  No, it's on the screen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=9.36s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=10.36s)]
*  We got it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=11.36s)]
*  It's good to have you here, Senator. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=12.36s)]
*  Good to be here, Chris. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=13.36s)]
*  I want to talk about the book, which I read over the last 24 hours, and I enjoyed quite [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=14.36s)]
*  a bit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=17.52s)]
*  The last time I had you on on Friday was on the day of the shutdown being averted. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=18.52s)]
*  And you came on the program, you said why you thought it was important, and since then [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=23.84s)]
*  we've had this enormous backlash. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=27.4s)]
*  And obviously, you're in politics a long time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=30.88s)]
*  You understand this comes to the territory. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=32.8s)]
*  Has it made you rethink anything? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=35.1s)]
*  No, look, I knew when I made this decision I'd get a lot of flak. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=38.28s)]
*  I'm a smart politician. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  I can read what people want. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=44.8s)]
*  But I thought even though the CR was a terrible, terrible bill and would allow within the CR, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=46.86s)]
*  the administration to move things around, I thought a shutdown was so much worse, 20 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=53.2s)]
*  times worse. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  And let me explain why so people understand it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=58.68000000000001s)]
*  Under a shutdown, the executive branch has absolute power to determine what is, quote, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=61.24s)]
*  essential. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=66.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=67.88s)]
*  They have the sole power. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=68.88s)]
*  Court rulings have said the courts have no say. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=69.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=70.88s)]
*  Now, under normal time, if it was a shutdown, okay, it'd be a Republican government. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=71.88s)]
*  They do that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=75.08s)]
*  You have these fanatics, these anti-government vicious nihilists in charge. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=76.08s)]
*  They can say anything. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=82.0s)]
*  Anything is not essential. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=83.88s)]
*  So it could have been today if we were in the shutdown, they said, feeding hungry children? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=85.2s)]
*  Not essential. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=89.72s)]
*  Eliminate SNAP. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=90.72s)]
*  Two days from now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=91.72s)]
*  The only thing we need in transportation are air traffic controllers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=92.76s)]
*  Cut off all mass transit funding to New York and the other cities of the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=96.2s)]
*  All transit funding. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=101.6s)]
*  Day six, Medicaid. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=103.4s)]
*  They could cut off Medicaid almost totally. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  So within two weeks, they could just so decimate the federal government, almost throwing a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=108.98s)]
*  bomb at it, that we could never recover. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=115.0s)]
*  And wait, one more thing that's worse. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=117.78s)]
*  There's no exit ramp. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  In other words, how do you get out of the shutdown? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  Solely up to the executive branch. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=123.42s)]
*  And one Republican senator who's close to these horrible Doge Musk people said that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=125.64s)]
*  they expected to close it down for six months, nine months, until the whole federal government [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=132.74s)]
*  was obliterated. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  Musk's dream, to get $2 trillion out of the federal government, could happen under a shutdown. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=138.52s)]
*  So I felt the very people who are upset now, if we went through with the shutdown and all [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=145.52s)]
*  these things happened, would be coming two, three weeks later and saying, get it open, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=150.0s)]
*  get SNAP open, get mass transit open. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=153.78s)]
*  I'd say, well, it's a shutdown. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=155.78s)]
*  We can't. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=157.34s)]
*  They said, well, why'd you let that happen? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=158.34s)]
*  So one more thing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=159.5s)]
*  I knew I'd take a lot of flak. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=160.94s)]
*  But you know, when you're a leader, sometimes you have to do things that you know are right [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=163.06s)]
*  despite the consequences. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=167.74s)]
*  I've always said to people in politics, the higher up you climb, the more fierce the winds [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=168.74s)]
*  blow. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=174.22s)]
*  The only thing that keeps you from being blown off course is your internal gyroscope. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=175.5s)]
*  That's what I used. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=180.26s)]
*  So I take that seriously, that catastrophic nature. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=181.56s)]
*  I thought so long and hard about it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=185.78s)]
*  Well, here's, let me just, I want to sort of pivot it a little to a more of a tactical [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=187.62s)]
*  decision because there was something that happened here that doesn't normally happen, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=191.82s)]
*  which is they knew they needed Democratic votes and they cut you out entirely. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=194.66s)]
*  Entirely. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=198.46s)]
*  Now, when that has happened before, Republicans have filibustered successfully and forced [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=199.46s)]
*  Democrats to the table. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=204.5s)]
*  And so just purely at the level of how the tactics brought us to this point, I want to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=205.5s)]
*  play some of the criticism again, not from like backseat drivers or not from me on cable [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=210.26s)]
*  news, but people like Khakim Jeffries or Nancy Pelosi. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=213.9s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=217.1s)]
*  Look, Chuck and I disagreed as it relates to the approach and outcome. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=219.1s)]
*  I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  And this is not just about progressive Democrats. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=228.22s)]
*  This is across the board, the entire party. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=230.84s)]
*  I still support Senator Schumer as leader, but I think the only way that we are going [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=233.06s)]
*  to be effective as a caucus is if we change our tactics. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  I would have liked to see when Chuck Schumer had leverage here to say we need A, B, C, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=242.34s)]
*  and D for the Democratic Party and force the Republicans to meet him halfway on those issues. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=249.22s)]
*  I myself don't give away anything for nothing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=255.1s)]
*  And I think that's what happened the other day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=259.1s)]
*  They said, OK, he said leverage. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=262.74s)]
*  I think it was the governor. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=264.42s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi said, I myself don't give away anything for nothing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=265.42s)]
*  I think that's what happened the other day. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=267.78s)]
*  The only leverage we had. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=268.78s)]
*  They weren't going to negotiate with us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=270.7s)]
*  So there were two choices only. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=272.14s)]
*  It would be nice if we had a third choice. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  We tried to get that third choice with the 30-day extension that Patty Murray tried to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=275.96s)]
*  get some moderate, more moderate Republicans on the Appropriations Committee go along. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=280.62s)]
*  They wouldn't. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  So we were faced only, only the Senate, not the House. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  They had it a little easier because they could vote no against the CR and not cause a shutdown. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=289.26s)]
*  But in the Senate, the only two choices were these choices, period. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=293.34s)]
*  And the choice of the shutdown was so severe, you're giving them the keys to the city. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=297.38s)]
*  Why would we? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=303.14s)]
*  Look, this guy, the worst of them all, is this guy who's head of OMB named Vote, V-O-U-G-H-T, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=304.14s)]
*  but people hear the word vote. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=311.1s)]
*  He already has a plan to shut down a large church in the third. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=312.42s)]
*  No, he cannot. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=315.5s)]
*  Now, if you don't have a shutdown, you can go to court. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=317.1s)]
*  And we've had some successful results in the courts. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=320.06s)]
*  A lot of the judges we put in, Chris, you know, the 235, we've won about 85% of the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=322.74s)]
*  cases. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=327.86s)]
*  Shutdown, no court, they make the decision, and they can make it quickly, easily, and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=328.86s)]
*  across the whole federal government, not just the things that were in the CR. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=333.5s)]
*  But here's to me my understanding of the critique that's broader than the specifics here, which [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=337.42s)]
*  is about the level and depth of crisis we're in and the appropriate tactics to meet them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  And so what I think people think is, first of all, we all know the Senate functions on [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=349.02s)]
*  unanimous consent. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=352.14s)]
*  It's how anything happens. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=353.14s)]
*  We've watched real pains in the butt. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=354.58s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville basically bring the place to a halt just denying unanimous consent because [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=357.34s)]
*  he was mad the Department of Defense might somewhere pay for a portion, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=362.58s)]
*  The idea of how cataclysmic that shutdown, I hear what you're saying. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=367.02s)]
*  But what I'm hearing from people, and there's a lot of them, is right now a crisis is happening [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  unlike anything the republic has faced maybe since even the Civil War. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=376.46s)]
*  Most Americans don't quite grasp it, and it's your job as the most powerful democrat [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=381.46s)]
*  to use whatever tactics you have to communicate that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=387.62s)]
*  And by going along with this, you have missed this opportunity to tell the nation just how [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=391.7s)]

*  Shut down. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=401.65999999999997s)]
*  This, we have to pick the fights, and I want to fight Trump as much as anybody and stop [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=402.65999999999997s)]

*  But in this situation, there was no... [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=411.18s)]
*  But doesn't it call the question? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=413.02s)]
*  But doesn't it call the question? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=414.46s)]
*  Doesn't the crisis create the attentional vortex that is necessary? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=415.58s)]
*  Because right now, people have no idea that they're going to basically get rid of all [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=419.38s)]
*  of American universities and all of American science funding. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=423.54s)]
*  We try to communicate it every night, but there's nothing like a crisis to drive that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=427.06s)]
*  home. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=431.06s)]

*  such damage... [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=437.58s)]
*  Substantively. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=438.58s)]

*  They will sit and negotiate with us because they're doing bad things. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=446.7s)]
*  That ain't these Republicans. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=450.7s)]
*  They wouldn't sit with us for nothing because their overall goal... [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  Look, the Republican Party is a new party. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=455.9s)]
*  It's controlled by these mega right billionaires. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=458.78s)]
*  They want two things. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=462.9s)]
*  They want to pay no taxes, so get rid of all the spending, even if it's... [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=464.3s)]
*  I mean, I was up today. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=467.9s)]
*  We had a Medicare Day of Action, Hakim and I, and senators and congressmen went and talked [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=469.5s)]
*  about Medicaid. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=473.74s)]
*  I went up to Montefiore Hospital, which covers all the Bronx. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=474.9s)]
*  It's the only cancer center in the whole Bronx. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=479.98s)]
*  80%... [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=482.06s)]
*  I grew up a block from Montefiore Hospital. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=483.06s)]
*  There you go. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=484.78s)]
*  Well, 80% of the people there are Medicare and Medicaid, and they're the only cancer [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=485.78s)]
*  treatment. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=490.38s)]
*  If they cut Medicaid by 20%, children would die. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=491.66s)]
*  Children would die. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=496.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=497.62s)]
*  That would happen with a shutdown. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=498.74s)]
*  Well, I mean... [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=499.74s)]
*  So you say, have leverage. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=500.74s)]
*  We should, but in this case, the choice given to us, because they couldn't... [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=502.5s)]
*  And I don't blame them. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=508.74s)]
*  They wouldn't negotiate with the Democrats because they had all the votes, because Trump [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=510.06s)]
*  is such a hammer, gave us only two choices. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=514.1s)]
*  So if there's... [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=517.22s)]
*  There was not a third choice. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=518.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=519.22s)]
*  So the question is, okay, these people won't negotiate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=520.22s)]
*  This was the one opportunity for leverage because of the need for a filibuster role [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=521.92s)]
*  proof majority. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=526.38s)]
*  They're not going to have that on reconciliation, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=527.86s)]
*  They're going to have it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=530.0600000000001s)]
*  They're going to be other opportunities. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  But then what's the... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=532.34s)]
*  Because what people hear is like, we're going to lie in the cut until they self-destruct. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=533.74s)]
*  No. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=537.26s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=538.26s)]
*  What's the plan? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=539.26s)]
*  But then what is the strategic plan? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=540.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=541.26s)]
*  Here is the plan. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=542.26s)]
*  Here's what we're doing right now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=543.26s)]
*  Okay? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=544.26s)]
*  There are two things I want to say. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=545.26s)]
*  One, every day we are hammering away at Trump, and we have a simple, simple thought that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=546.26s)]
*  unites the Democratic Party from one end to the other. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=553.78s)]
*  He's asking the middle class to pay for tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=557.1s)]
*  It unites us all. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=561.0600000000001s)]
*  Bernie Sanders likes it, and my most conservative members like it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  We're hammering away at that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=565.08s)]
*  Today it was Medicaid. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=566.3000000000001s)]
*  Tomorrow it's going to be... [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  In the next few days, it's going to be tariffs. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=568.3000000000001s)]
*  He's raising those tariffs, raising your cost, Mr. and Mrs. American, by $2,000 a year if [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=570.0400000000001s)]
*  he raises all these tariffs so that he can use that money for tax cuts for the billionaires. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  He's cutting your education funds in so your kids don't get a great education, and your [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=580.4200000000001s)]
*  school taxes will go up for that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=584.12s)]
*  So we have started doing this day in, day out, every day, fighting relentlessly. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=586.66s)]
*  His numbers have started to go down from 51 to 47. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=591.54s)]
*  If we keep at it and keep at it and keep at it, his numbers will be much lower. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=595.1s)]
*  He will not only be less popular but less effective. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  Second, we will find the moments where we shouldn't give them votes. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  Hakeem and I met yesterday. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=608.5s)]
*  We're exploring that right now, and there will be times, just like this instance, where [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=609.9s)]
*  people will say, don't give them the votes because you have the leverage. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=613.94s)]
*  There will be instances, not like this, where a shutdown would ensue, but where we will [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=617.94s)]
*  have the higher ground. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=623.2600000000001s)]
*  And we're going to do it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=624.2600000000001s)]
*  Watch us. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=625.2600000000001s)]
*  Okay, but here's what I would say in response to that, and again, I'm channeling people [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=626.2600000000001s)]
*  as much as I can. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=629.6600000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=630.6600000000001s)]
*  Hey, this is a democracy still. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=631.6600000000001s)]
*  Let's hope it stays. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=632.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, here's what I'm saying. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=633.6600000000001s)]
*  Is that all of those things you enumerated, which all sound like good politics to me, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=634.6600000000001s)]
*  are the kinds of things that you'd be doing if Mitt Romney were president. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=639.7800000000001s)]
*  There's this weird asymmetry right now, which is that they are acting in this totally new [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=642.9000000000001s)]
*  way, in which they are ambitiously trying to seize all power and create a presidential [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=648.0200000000001s)]
*  dictatorship in the United States of America, and the Democratic opposition is acting like, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=652.7s)]
*  well, if we can get their pool rate down a few points, then what? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=657.62s)]
*  And what happens? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=660.98s)]
*  Well, what happens is, look, first, we get it way down. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=661.98s)]
*  He's going to have much less. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=665.46s)]
*  This worked in 2017. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=666.94s)]
*  We say it didn't. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=667.94s)]
*  Now it's a different government. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=668.94s)]
*  It's different, though. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=670.22s)]
*  Oh, it is different. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=671.22s)]
*  But health care, we beat them. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=672.38s)]
*  Taxes, we beat them. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=674.4200000000001s)]
*  And guess what we did? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=675.6600000000001s)]
*  Guess what we did, Chris? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=676.6600000000001s)]
*  We took back the House and won in the Senate, and then we were allowed to do all those good [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=677.6600000000001s)]
*  things. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=682.14s)]
*  This is not the only tactic. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=683.14s)]
*  We have to stand strong in certain instances and not give them the votes at all. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=684.22s)]
*  But there are instances where the two work together. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=688.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=691.74s)]
*  Again, I don't disagree with any of that, but the difference to me between 2017 and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=692.74s)]
*  now, and I've been at this desk for both of them, it is a full-fledged assault on the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=696.22s)]
*  constitutional order that has not been seen again, certainly in my life. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=700.9399999999999s)]
*  That is true. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=705.54s)]
*  But the question then becomes... [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=706.54s)]
*  But that's not the spending part. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=707.54s)]
*  That isn't, but then the question becomes what is the role of the minority in resisting [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=709.4599999999999s)]
*  that that's distinct from, we're going to beat them on health care, we're going to beat [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=714.22s)]
*  them on spending Medicaid. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=718.5s)]
*  Look, if our democracy is at risk... [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=719.5s)]
*  It is at risk. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=722.1s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=723.1s)]
*  It is certainly at risk. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=724.1s)]
*  Well, do you believe it is? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=725.1s)]
*  But if there be... [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=726.1s)]
*  If... [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=727.1s)]
*  I don't want to put words in your mouth. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=728.1s)]
*  Do you believe it's at risk? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=729.1s)]
*  If you don't obey the Supreme Court, which may happen, you let up to it here, then we [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=730.3000000000001s)]
*  will have two courts. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=736.5400000000001s)]
*  We will have the federal courts, which hopefully John Roberts will stand up and make it happen, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=737.98s)]
*  but we'll have the court of public opinion. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=742.26s)]
*  And if that happens, as you pointed out, we have had rule of law since the Magna Carta. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=743.98s)]
*  OK? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=749.22s)]
*  And if that happens and the rule of law goes by the wayside, I believe that there will [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=750.4200000000001s)]
*  be very, very... [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=757.34s)]
*  You know, there will be immediate and strong reaction from one end of the country to the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=759.86s)]
*  other in ways that we have never seen. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=767.98s)]
*  And that's what will happen. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=771.02s)]
*  And it's not just up to us. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=772.5s)]
*  The people will have to rise up, not just Democrats, not just Republicans, not just, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=774.26s)]
*  you know, people, everybody. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=779.34s)]
*  But our democracy will be at stake then. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=781.5400000000001s)]
*  And if the people make their voices heard and are strong and stand up and we join them, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=785.06s)]
*  I believe we can try to beat that back. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=790.62s)]
*  We can beat that back. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=792.6999999999999s)]
*  But it's... [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=794.3s)]
*  On that one, if democracy is at risk, that's a little different than what we're talking [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=795.3s)]
*  about now. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=799.54s)]
*  Even a shutdown, as horrible as it is, we'll all have to stand up and fight back in every [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=800.54s)]
*  way. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=805.22s)]
*  I think actually this is useful because I do think, like, just in a genuine sort of [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=806.22s)]
*  way, that there's a lot of people, and I think I probably count myself among them, who think [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=810.66s)]
*  that that's where we are right now. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=815.54s)]
*  The plan being deployed right now... [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=818.62s)]
*  You may be right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=820.3s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=821.3s)]
*  We're there. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=822.3s)]
*  I think we're getting there. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=823.3s)]
*  You think we're not there yet. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=824.3s)]
*  Well, I think we're getting there. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=825.3s)]
*  And we have to be really vigilant. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=826.3s)]
*  I just had a meeting today with the Judiciary Committee to decide how we're working through [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=827.3s)]
*  this as it goes further. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  It hasn't been up to the Supreme Court yet, which would be the classic if they disobey [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=831.78s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=835.9399999999999s)]
*  We're on our way there. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=836.9399999999999s)]
*  God forbid, but I think we are. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=838.74s)]
*  And we'll have to go at it and at it and at it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=840.5400000000001s)]
*  And that is different than anything else. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=844.5s)]
*  Different than anything else. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=848.4200000000001s)]
*  It's a quantum leap different because our democracy is then 248 years of American democracy. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=849.4200000000001s)]
*  The Magna Carta is out the window. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=855.38s)]
*  And we will all have to take extraordinary action. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=856.74s)]
*  You have a new book. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=861.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=862.82s)]
*  And I would like to talk about it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=863.82s)]
*  Good. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=864.82s)]
*  So I'm going to take a quick break, Senator. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=865.82s)]
*  We're going to talk about anti-Semitism in America, a warning right after this quick [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=867.14s)]
*  break. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=870.42s)]
*  Great. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=871.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=872.42s)]
*  I'm back with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who is the highest elected Jewish official [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=873.42s)]
*  in America and the author of the brand new book, Anti-Semitism in America, a warning. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=877.5s)]
*  You write about this in the book about it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=883.9s)]
*  It's sort of a really interesting thing about your relationship to your Jewish identity, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=885.14s)]
*  its centrality or marginality in terms of your public facing role and the decision to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=889.66s)]
*  write this now. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=894.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=895.48s)]
*  I'm going to write the book. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=896.48s)]
*  Look, I was born in 1950. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=897.48s)]
*  The first 50 years, 1950 to 2000, what we Jews referred to as the Golden Medina, the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=900.0s)]
*  golden era. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=904.96s)]
*  Jews never had it so good. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=906.08s)]
*  Economically, we were advancing from working class and poor up into the middle class. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=907.44s)]
*  So were Irish, Italian, everybody else. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=912.6s)]
*  But it was great. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=914.62s)]
*  But second, there was virtually no anti-Semitism, much less why. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=915.6800000000001s)]
*  The shadow of the Holocaust hung over America. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=920.2s)]
*  And so Jews who were previously not allowed to live here or not allowed to work here or [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=923.68s)]
*  whatever, that all left. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  Even sort of the innuendos were decreased. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  It was not good to say it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=931.8s)]
*  So it was a great era. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=933.2399999999999s)]
*  Starting in about 2000, it begins to change. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=935.3599999999999s)]
*  When bad things happen, things always seem to turn on the Jews. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=937.9399999999999s)]
*  So we had 9-11 and there was some of it, remember 400 Jews. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=940.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, the myth was 400 Jews were told to leave early. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=944.68s)]
*  In fact, that's been revived in this era of right-wing conspiracies. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=948.0s)]
*  Yes, it has. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=952.04s)]
*  2008, you get the international financial crisis, George Soros, the Jewish conspirators. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=953.1999999999999s)]
*  But it never really got that bad until October 7th. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=958.52s)]
*  And after that, it just skyrocketed dramatically. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=962.88s)]
*  Let me just finish. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=965.8s)]
*  OK? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=966.8s)]
*  And things we never saw before happened. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=967.8s)]
*  They'd throw a rock through a Jewish deli in Philly. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=969.88s)]
*  They don't know what the politics of that man was. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=974.04s)]
*  In my neighborhood, the head of the Brooklyn Museum was Jewish. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=977.26s)]
*  Brooklyn Museum had nothing to do with Israel. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=979.5999999999999s)]
*  It was paint smeared all over her. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=981.68s)]
*  Jews spat upon, Jews vilified, Jews just treated the way we never did. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=983.5999999999999s)]
*  So for the first time, Jewish people began to say, not that they thought it would, but [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=988.56s)]
*  they were worried, we're warriors. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=993.7199999999999s)]
*  It could happen here because they remembered there were golden eras before and when things [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=995.7199999999999s)]
*  went bad, they turned on us in all kinds of ways. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1000.18s)]
*  And so I wrote, I started thinking about this. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1004.2399999999999s)]
*  I gave a speech on the floor condemning anti-Semitism, particularly on the left since I was a progressive. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1006.3599999999999s)]
*  I thought I'd have more say talking about it on the left, although it's awful on the right too. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1011.8s)]
*  And I kept thinking and thinking and thinking and said, I had to write the book. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1015.96s)]
*  The book, in conclusion, is aimed at five different audiences. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1020.68s)]
*  First, my generation. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1023.96s)]
*  We feel alone. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  We feel sort of isolated. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1027.6399999999999s)]
*  I thought I could, going through my experience, not so different than my generation's experience, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  would give people some help in feeling that they're not alone. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1033.96s)]
*  Second, to their children. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1036.8s)]
*  Our children are Jewish and proudly Jewish and pro-Israel, most of them, but they don't [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1038.44s)]
*  know the history, how Israel was beleaguered, how so much change occurred from back then. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1042.8400000000001s)]
*  Third group are Christians who have goodwill to Jews. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1053.88s)]
*  And they understand there's anti-Semitism, but their sort of attitude is, you're making [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  too big a fuss about it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1061.72s)]
*  They don't carry 5,000 years of history on our back, and when it starts, sometimes it [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1063.3600000000001s)]
*  doesn't stop. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1067.0800000000002s)]
*  Fourth group was the left, because I felt an obligation to talk to the left about anti-Semitism, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1068.28s)]
*  where I thought I could better than others. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1073.36s)]
*  But finally, it's America. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1075.36s)]
*  And I hope every college and every high school will make this either required reading or [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1078.06s)]
*  at least advisory reading, because people don't know the histories of the young people. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1084.22s)]
*  20 percent think the Holocaust is a lie, and another 50 percent have no knowledge what [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1089.6799999999998s)]
*  it is. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  Campuses have been obviously a real focal point in all of this, and I know that from [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1095.92s)]
*  friends of mine who are Jewish, we're very, very focused on what's happening on campus. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  It's also become this kind of fulcrum in this moment in our politics. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1104.0800000000002s)]
*  You've got the Trump administration writing to Columbia that had these protests saying [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1108.52s)]
*  we're cutting off $400 million in federal money unless basically you kind of hand over [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1114.0s)]
*  the administration of your university. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1120.28s)]
*  I want to read you this just because this really struck me today. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1123.52s)]
*  I saw someone who is an epidemiology Ph.D. student who had their dissertation at Columbia [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1125.64s)]
*  canceled. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1130.76s)]
*  Okay? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1131.76s)]
*  Someone who studies substance use disorder. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1132.76s)]
*  Because of this $400 million. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1135.3600000000001s)]
*  This is what was told. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1136.3600000000001s)]
*  This project has been terminated due to unsafe anti-Semitic actions that suggest the institution [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1137.6000000000001s)]
*  lacks concern for the safety and well-being of Jewish students. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1143.0s)]
*  This is a Ph.D. dissertation in epidemiology. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1145.48s)]
*  Columbia University may request funds to support patient safety and orderly close out a project. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1148.72s)]
*  Do you think this is a good faith attempt to deal with the anti-Semitism? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1153.8000000000002s)]
*  Look, let's start. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  Columbia didn't do enough, especially in the early days, to go after anti-Semitism. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1160.5600000000002s)]
*  I've spoken to Jewish students there who were vilified and even hit and hurt. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1165.96s)]
*  They didn't do enough. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1170.1200000000001s)]
*  Having said that, what Trump does is he takes this blunderbuss. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  He just takes $400 million. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1175.16s)]
*  We don't know why, where, when, who. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1177.2800000000002s)]
*  Probably a lot of that $400 million goes to cancer research or Alzheimer's research like [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1179.76s)]
*  this at Columbia Presbyterian. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1185.08s)]
*  A lot of it may go to helping educate students. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1187.48s)]
*  And it'll hurt the 98% of students who never protested, even the Jewish students who might [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1190.0s)]
*  have been picked on. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1194.4s)]
*  So this is outrageous. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1195.44s)]
*  It's just aimed at the universities. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1196.76s)]
*  If you have some instance where someone didn't do something about anti-Semitism and should [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1199.04s)]
*  have, go after that person or that group. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1203.4s)]
*  But this is aimed at hurting universities. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1206.86s)]
*  And I think it's spreading, and I think it's very, very wrong. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1210.1s)]
*  You just said, you were saying before, it was interesting, you were saying Jewish pro-Israel, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1215.3s)]
*  most of them, comma. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1218.54s)]
*  And you have this stuff in the book that's great about all these sort of sticky Jewish [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1219.9399999999998s)]
*  jokes about disputation, right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1223.4599999999998s)]
*  Two Jews in a room, three opinions. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1226.82s)]
*  There's the guy on the island who builds a second synagogue he doesn't set foot in, right? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1228.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1232.9799999999998s)]
*  You know, it seems to me... [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1233.98s)]
*  My favorite one is the three sentences that describe each Jewish holiday. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1235.78s)]
*  Yes, they tried to kill us. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1239.38s)]
*  They tried to kill us. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1240.58s)]
*  They failed. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1241.58s)]
*  Let's eat. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1242.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1243.58s)]
*  But it shows you the Jewish mentality. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1244.58s)]
*  Right, but on this question of disputatiousness to me, really, this is where, because I know [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1245.58s)]
*  Jewish people who are protesting at these universities. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1250.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1252.58s)]
*  Right, but it seems to me that one of the things that happens here is that there is [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1253.82s)]
*  this conflation of Israel and Judaism, which is both the conflation of the anti-Semites [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1258.34s)]
*  who are throwing the rock through the Jewish deli, right? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1263.62s)]
*  But then in the defense of Israel, it seems like the defenders kind of want to write out [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1266.78s)]
*  the Jews who are opposed to Israel's actions or anti-Zionist even in their inclination. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1272.4199999999998s)]
*  You're looking at somebody who wrote a very strong speech which got a lot of negative [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1276.7399999999998s)]
*  reaction in the Jewish community criticizing Netanyahu for the way he conducted the war. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1280.32s)]
*  I wrote that speech because I had to show that you could be very pro-Israel and disagree [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1284.82s)]
*  with Netanyahu's policies. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1290.04s)]
*  And I think it's really important to say criticism of Israel per se is not anti-Semitic, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1291.94s)]
*  but it's too often shaded over into anti-Semitism, overt anti-Semitism, and sometimes right on [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1297.52s)]
*  the edge. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1304.26s)]
*  Let's just take an example, okay? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1305.26s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1306.8600000000001s)]
*  That's Hamas's slogan to wipe out all the Jews in all of, from the Jordan River to the [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1309.46s)]
*  Mediterranean Sea, all of them. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1316.18s)]
*  And in fact, in Hamas's charter, they quote an Arab proverb, is that a Jew behind a tree? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1317.74s)]
*  Chop down the tree and shoot him. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1323.54s)]
*  When people say that, some of them don't know it's leading to anti-Semitism, but it is. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1325.5s)]
*  And I thought it was important to alert. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1330.58s)]
*  You know, when we hear dog whistles that hurt certain ethnic groups, we say we shouldn't [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1332.3s)]
*  do those. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1336.14s)]
*  That hasn't happened yet here, and I wanted to alert people to the danger of some of these [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1337.64s)]
*  which are not just protest per se in criticizing Israel, perfectly legitimate, I've done it [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1344.5s)]
*  myself, but slide over into anti-Semitism and aiding and abetting anti-Semitism. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1348.7s)]
*  So, I mean, first of all, I should say that Likud's official position about the Israeli [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1353.5s)]
*  state right now is that it has the river to the sea. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1357.98s)]
*  I mean, the governing... [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1360.54s)]
*  That is Smoltryk and Ben-Gavir. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1362.86s)]
*  They just rejoined the government, and one of the actions... [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1365.46s)]
*  One of the reasons I gave my speech against Netanyahu is I said we need a two-state solution. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1367.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1371.78s)]
*  That's a little different than what Hamas is saying. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1373.46s)]
*  But here's the thing that struck me in reading your book is that it seems to me there's these [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1375.3799999999999s)]
*  sort of two periods here. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1378.74s)]
*  There's the trauma of October 7th, which is the worst mass killing of Jews since the Holocaust, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1379.98s)]
*  and just horribly traumatic both if it were any people happening with no 5,000-year history [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1384.3s)]
*  and extra-traumatic with a 5,000-year history. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1391.3s)]
*  And then there's what happens afterwards in the protest movement. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1394.62s)]
*  And it just seems to me there's a little conflation between what I think was shown in the polling [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1397.48s)]
*  and generally very, very small active support for Hamas in the wake of that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1402.62s)]
*  And then the protest movement that grows up as 50,000 people, including 15,000 children, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1408.1799999999998s)]
*  are killed with American bombs. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1413.06s)]
*  And I ache for them. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1414.5s)]
*  I see this kid, picture of a kid with no legs. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1415.5s)]
*  I ache. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1417.62s)]
*  I see this little girl whose parents were killed, Palestinian. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1418.62s)]
*  I ache. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1420.54s)]
*  But what's underplayed totally is the role of Hamas in that tragedy even afterwards. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1421.54s)]
*  Hamas uses by doctrine the innocent Palestinians as human shields. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1427.26s)]
*  They put rockets in hospitals. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1433.34s)]
*  They put schools there. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1435.62s)]
*  Wait. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1436.62s)]
*  The head of the late head of Hamas said these Palestinians who were killed are necessary [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1437.62s)]
*  sacrifices. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1443.1s)]
*  His words. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1444.1s)]
*  They've said it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1445.1s)]
*  The media doesn't play it up. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1446.1s)]
*  And the world doesn't realize the difficult position Israel is in trying to make sure [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1447.1s)]
*  that Hamas doesn't come back because we know what Hamas would do again because Hamas has [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1450.86s)]
*  I don't know any other country that has used people as human shields the way Hamas has. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1457.5800000000002s)]
*  Isn't every insurgent in Viet Cong any insurgent army? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1462.28s)]
*  Never the same way. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1466.24s)]
*  Never the same way. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1467.5600000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1468.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1469.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1470.5600000000002s)]
*  Insurgent armies sometimes run into trouble that way. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1471.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, they're always amongst the populace. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1473.04s)]
*  That's the way an insurgent army operates. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1474.52s)]
*  It's not a policy the way it is with Hamas. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1477.0s)]
*  Rockets in hospitals and using humans as human shields. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1479.88s)]
*  But what I'm saying is the media they showed every day pictures of Palestinians being hurt [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1483.2s)]
*  and we ache for that. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1488.68s)]
*  They almost never mentioned that a lot of these were human shields. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1490.0800000000002s)]
*  A lot of them. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1493.48s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1494.48s)]
*  If there's the size of Gaza is less than it's basically Manhattan and it's got two million [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1495.48s)]
*  people. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1500.2s)]
*  But Chris, but Chris, all I'm saying is a good amount of the blame for the tragedy here, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1501.2s)]
*  which we hate. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1506.0s)]
*  I think Israel didn't have the right policies in certain areas and I was not took I criticize [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1507.3600000000001s)]
*  them regularly, you know, but no one seems to mention when I see these protesters, I [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1512.46s)]
*  said, well, what about Hamas? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1517.26s)]
*  They ignore them, ignore them. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1518.58s)]
*  So there's only one side to this and that's not fair. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1520.6599999999999s)]
*  Let me I'm going to have to say one more block. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1523.7s)]
*  You have a you have a place to be. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1525.94s)]
*  I want to talk about. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1527.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1528.74s)]
*  But I want to ask one more question. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1529.74s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1530.74s)]
*  About Trump. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1531.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1532.74s)]
*  And about what the president said about you and all. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1533.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1534.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1535.74s)]
*  You're going to stay here. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1536.74s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1537.74s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1538.74s)]
*  Joining me again, New York Senator, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, author of the new book [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1539.74s)]
*  Anti-Semitism in America, a warning. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1542.98s)]
*  You know, one of the there's lots of awful things Trump says all the time. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1543.98s)]
*  A thing I find personally truly despicable is this use of the word Palestinian as a slur, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1549.0600000000002s)]
*  as an insult, which he has now directed towards you multiple times, saying even that you're [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1554.74s)]
*  not Jewish anymore. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1560.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1561.42s)]
*  Don't tell my mother. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1562.42s)]
*  Look, Trump has far too often tolerated all kinds of anti-Semitic things. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1563.9s)]
*  He regards the Jews sort of as transactional. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1572.98s)]
*  So money, the Jews, votes, the Jews, but no real understanding of who we are. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1575.98s)]
*  And look at the things he's done. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1582.22s)]
*  In Charlottesville, both sides are to blame. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1583.98s)]
*  He sits down with a bigoted anti-Semite, he has a lot of people in his administration [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1586.22s)]
*  who believe in this great replacement theory, which is an anti-Semitic troll or not troll [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1592.58s)]
*  philosophy, all the dangerous thinking. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1599.1399999999999s)]
*  And he cut off all the money. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1603.06s)]
*  We work very hard for this called nonprofit security grant, money for synagogues that [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1605.4199999999998s)]
*  have been accosted by anti-Semitic activities, for doors, for windows, for protection. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1609.82s)]
*  So if you look at his actions, a lot of them, he's not protecting Jewish people. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1614.98s)]
*  Again, transactional. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1620.4199999999998s)]
*  You know what he ought to do, Chris? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1621.4199999999998s)]
*  He ought to read my book. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1623.2199999999998s)]
*  He might learn something. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1624.9399999999998s)]
*  I learned today that there's a guy who runs the anti-Semitism task force in the Trump [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1626.78s)]
*  administration whose name is Leo Terrell, who is a civil rights attorney who has now [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1631.18s)]
*  been tasked with running this thing. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1636.18s)]
*  And there was a tweet by a prominent neo-Nazi basically saying that Trump can revoke the [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1639.24s)]
*  Jew card, the Jewishness, that that guy, the anti-Semitism guy, retweeted. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1645.42s)]
*  Well, there should be an outcry from his right-wing friends and Jewish right-wing friends that [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1651.1399999999999s)]
*  that guy should be fired. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrnnd_Cb4n4&t=1656.2s)]
