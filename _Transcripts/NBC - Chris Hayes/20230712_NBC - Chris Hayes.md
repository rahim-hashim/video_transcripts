Video Description: Farmers Insurance is now the fourth major home insurer to leave Florida. With no real solution to this growing problem, the DeSantis administration is blaming wokeness. "This is not about wokeness—this is about the weather," says Wharton professor and economist Ben Keys.

# ‘Bud Light of insurance’ Florida official blames insurer crisis on wokeness
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw)
*  Over the next few months in Florida, around 100,000 homeowners will find that their homeowners [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=0.0s)]
*  insurance is ending in the middle of hurricane season. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=4.92s)]
*  And that is because farmers insurance is now the fourth major home insurer to leave the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=7.68s)]
*  state. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty clear why. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Florida, of course, has always been subject to lots of extreme weather, but things have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  gotten much worse as climate change ramps up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=18.6s)]
*  For instance, take a look right now at the ocean temperatures around Florida on Monday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=21.8s)]
*  Florida's in white there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=27.16s)]
*  That's the ocean around it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=28.16s)]
*  That is 90 degrees or higher water temperature. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=29.48s)]
*  90 degrees. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  That's bathtub, hot tub border. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=34.28s)]
*  Nearly unheard of. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And this is crucial because the warmth of the ocean is the energy that powers hurricanes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=38.6s)]
*  So farmers is just doing the math. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=45.0s)]
*  The administration of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has no actual response to this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  pressing issue. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And so what they've decided to do is, wait for it, attack farmers insurance for being [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  too woke. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  The state chief financial officer released a statement saying, quote, I sincerely believe [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=59.0s)]
*  that today's actions, farmers insurance is well on its way to becoming the bud light [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=64.6s)]
*  of insurance. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=68.52s)]
*  But no amount of culture war is going to solve the basic problem here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=69.52s)]
*  Insurers are fleeing the market and insurance premiums are shooting up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=75.6s)]
*  Ben Keys is an economist and a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=79.44s)]
*  Wharton School of Business. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=82.66s)]
*  He's been studying the cost of the climate crisis for years, particularly insurance, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=84.0s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=87.4s)]
*  Ben, you've given testimony before the Senate on this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=89.0s)]
*  You wrote a New York Times op-ed on this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=91.56s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  This farmers is not the first. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=95.84s)]
*  But why are they leaving? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Chris. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  This is not about wokeness. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  It's about the weather. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  Storms have gotten more severe, more frequent. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  We've already had 12 storms this year across the country or 12 disasters that have been [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=109.04s)]
*  more than a billion dollars in verified damages. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  So that's factor number one. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=116.42s)]
*  Factor number two is that the costs of rebuilding have gone up faster than inflation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=118.74s)]
*  The cost of materials is very high and the cost of labor in our tight labor market is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=124.06s)]
*  also very high. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=128.22s)]
*  And the third is maybe the least woke aspect, which is the reinsurance market. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=129.72s)]
*  And this is how insurers protect themselves on the back end. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=133.6s)]
*  And the reinsurers have said, we see the models, we see the data, and we're not willing to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  ensure these portfolios in the ways that we were in the past. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=142.26s)]
*  And so those three factors are driving insurers to raise premiums, cut coverage or leave the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=145.26s)]
*  state entirely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=150.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=151.78s)]
*  So on that last thing, and just to do a little insurance 101, right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=152.78s)]
*  So you're running an insurance company, you're taking premiums from people, they're taking [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  little payments as a hedge against catastrophic risk, right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=158.7s)]
*  So you're taking in that money, then you got to do something with that money, right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  And when a storm hits, right, all of a sudden you've got lots of claims, right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=166.34s)]
*  You got to pay that out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  And so what the insurers do is they have their own insurers as a way of hedging their own [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=170.92s)]
*  risk that are like reinsurance companies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  And those companies, I understand, have been sort of at the forefront of thinking about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  climate models, right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah, they have a lot of money at stake. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  This is their business, is protecting themselves from these types of disasters and pooling [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  risk and spreading it as widely as possible. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=193.38s)]
*  And so when the alarms go off for the reinsurers, that's when they pass on the changing costs [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=196.64s)]
*  to the insurers and the insurers then pass it on to the homeowners directly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  You write that even with higher premiums, unpredictable losses are wreaking havoc on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  the bottom lines of insurers. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  Ten insurers, ten insurers have gone belly up in Florida in just the last two years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  And here's the other thing that is notable to me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=216.2s)]
*  I was talking to someone who was in California and talking about the parts of California. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  It's one thing if your premiums go up, which is terrible, and I think the average, the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=222.06s)]
*  median in Florida is like $6,000 a year in home insurance. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  But it's a whole other thing if insurers just say, no, it's uninsurable. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=230.02s)]
*  I mean, I think there are parts of California that are very exposed to wildfire risk where [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=233.62s)]
*  it's just like, it's not a question of what premium you could pay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=239.18s)]
*  It's just you can't find insurers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=242.06s)]
*  Yeah, and the absence of an insurance policy is deeply troubling for that community because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=244.34s)]
*  without an insurance policy, you're not going to be able to get a mortgage. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=252.1s)]
*  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't issue a mortgage unless you can attach an insurance policy [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  to it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=258.86s)]
*  And without a mortgage, without that kind of financing, housing markets can collapse [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  or seize up in very dramatic ways. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=264.42s)]
*  And so I think what we're going to see more of is more dependency on these state-run insurers [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=267.5s)]
*  of last resort. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=272.98s)]
*  So like Citizens Insurance in Florida, which now has 1.3 million policyholders, is the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=274.06s)]
*  largest insurer in the state. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=279.26s)]
*  And this was set up to be very much a stopgap kind of program. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=281.9s)]
*  And instead, it's taken on a predominant role in the entire market. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=286.82s)]
*  So I think we're going to see much more of a role for the state to play when there are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=290.5s)]
*  no private insurers willing to bear the risk. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, this is where it's all headed, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=296.9s)]
*  And this is, again, you've got to be a little skeptical. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=299.58s)]
*  The insurance companies, I can't quite always take them face value, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=301.78s)]
*  They want to keep their premiums high and their claims low. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=304.82s)]
*  I think they're also, everyone's looking around for public subsidy, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=308.26s)]
*  So what ends up going to be the case, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=311.46s)]
*  The free market, up by your bootstraps, big bad government folks, are going to have to, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  in all these places that are very weather exposed, Texas, Florida, and all throughout [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=320.85999999999996s)]
*  the Southeast particularly, are basically, it's going to fall to the government, which [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=324.74s)]
*  is the insurer of last resort, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  And it always is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=331.94s)]
*  And so I think when we're thinking about this idea of the free market, the free market is [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=332.94s)]
*  a very circumscribed, plays a very circumscribed role in the insurance market. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=337.02s)]
*  Insurance markets are very highly regulated. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=340.62s)]
*  And we have a number of programs at state and federal levels that provide a ton of support. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=343.06s)]
*  So the National Flood Insurance Program being the clearest example of an insurance market [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  where private insurers were unwilling to provide the degree of coverage necessary. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=354.38s)]
*  And so we needed to nationalize that market and create an entire national market. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=358.74s)]
*  And you may need to see something similar for wildfires, for instance, going forward, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=362.34s)]
*  or other types of backstops that are going to be more resilient than what any individual [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=366.62s)]
*  state could put together because the uncertainty is whether these state run entities will have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=372.58s)]
*  the political will to charge people the right price. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  And that's what this partly comes down to is, is the price going to be set to really [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=379.78s)]
*  induce adaptation? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=384.86s)]
*  Are we going to see meaningful behavior change? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=386.14s)]
*  And that happens when people are forced to pay premiums that reflect the risk. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  So that's I mean, let's just talk about the risk for a second. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=393.21999999999997s)]
*  Here's I just want to show people again to remember where we are as I speak to you this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=395.54s)]
*  summer of 2023. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=399.34s)]
*  This is daily temperature summer 2023. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=400.38s)]
*  You'll see that curve there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=403.54s)]
*  And then there's a line at the top. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=404.58s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=405.98s)]
*  We're sort of off the chart. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=407.14s)]
*  Daily temperature 2023. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=408.82s)]
*  That's us right there at the top. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=410.5s)]
*  Right. This is sea surface temperature. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=412.78s)]
*  You can get a sense of what's going on in the water, the sea surface temperature again. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=416.1s)]
*  That's us at the top in red 2023 right off the chart. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=420.34s)]
*  That point about adaptation is the ultimate one, which is it's not good. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=423.78s)]
*  I mean, what's going to happen, what I fear is that we subsidize people living in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=430.38s)]
*  path of disaster. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  And that's going to be really destructive. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=436.46s)]
*  But that looks like the way we're headed in states like Florida. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=442.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, that's what we've done for decades. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  So through the National Flood Insurance Program, through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=445.46s)]
*  which don't price geographic risk of their loans, through many other federal programs, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=449.62s)]
*  we subsidize living in harm's way. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=455.86s)]
*  And I think the big question that's going to face local, state and federal policymakers [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=457.66s)]
*  is who's going to bear those risks going forward? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=463.18s)]
*  Are we going to be willing to continue to subsidize that type of living or are we going [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=465.5s)]
*  to make those who are choosing to live in the most exposed areas pay the price? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=476.14s)]
*  Ben Keys, who's been a really key resource on this for me. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=476.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=479.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrM4OmV4Rw&t=481.26s)]
