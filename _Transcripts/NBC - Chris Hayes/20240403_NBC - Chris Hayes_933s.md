# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 2
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg)
*  Donald Trump spent the past week attacking the daughter of the judge in his New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=0.0s)]
*  hush money trial. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=4.64s)]
*  It started after an initial gag order was imposed barring Trump from commenting publicly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  about lawyers, witnesses, court staff, and jurors in the trial, now scheduled to start [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=10.64s)]
*  April 15th. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=15.08s)]
*  And in the days that followed, Trump attacked the judge's daughter at least four times on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  his Truth Social platform, posting her name, also posting a news story with photos of her. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=20.38s)]
*  And he basically painted a target on this young woman's back, so much so, the judge [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=26.56s)]
*  had to adjust the order to cover his own family members. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=30.839999999999996s)]
*  And family members of the district attorney, writing, quote, this pattern of attacking [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=34.4s)]
*  family members or presiding jurors and attorneys assigned to his cases serves no legitimate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=37.3s)]
*  purpose. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=41.68s)]
*  It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=42.8s)]
*  not only they, but their family members as well, a fair game for defendants vitriol. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=46.76s)]
*  Yesterday, the judge expanded the gag order on Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=52.6s)]
*  Since then, Trump has still been attacking the judge, but notably he has stopped just [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  short of attacking the judge's daughter. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=59.68s)]
*  Joining me now is MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=61.64s)]
*  And first, I just want to start with this, that every time we do one of these, you can [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=65.68s)]
*  sort of lose sight of how just completely out of unprecedented it is, how different [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=70.56s)]
*  it is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  This just does not happen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't happen in courtrooms. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't happen with defendants. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=81.6s)]
*  We're just in a totally different universe in which this man with a lot of power and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=83.88s)]
*  a lot of followers is berating the judge's daughter. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=88.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=90.8s)]
*  And every time you and I get together or I show up on other shows talking about the extraordinary [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=91.8s)]
*  ness of the moment, that in and of itself becomes ordinary for viewers who then grow [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  inoculated to this kind of behavior that is so far beyond the pale of what's acceptable [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  in most courtrooms in the United States that we forget. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=106.0s)]
*  Or even what would be attempted. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=110.4s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=111.4s)]
*  Like, yes, it's unacceptable. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=112.4s)]
*  But even just like in a universe in which there are millions of criminal defendants, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=113.4s)]
*  this just doesn't really happen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  No, it doesn't because most criminal defendants would face consequences far sooner than Donald [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=119.64s)]
*  Trump has. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  So there have been some consequences, at least the gag order has been expanded. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  And again, we've seen this, we saw this in the past with Nguyen Goh-Ren. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=129.8s)]
*  We've seen it in other places where he does know what he's doing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=133.56s)]
*  And so he stops just short. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he stops just short. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=137.28s)]
*  So what does he do now? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=138.6s)]
*  He reposts other people's statements about the daughter in order to skirt the prohibition, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  which is framed as he can't make or direct others to make public statements about certain [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  folks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  He's not making a statement. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  He's not directing others to make a statement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  He's merely republishing a statement. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=157.4s)]
*  But that has the exact same thrust and gist to the things he was saying before. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=159.84s)]
*  There's also now a request for recusal, which strikes me as, you know, I don't know, a not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=165.16s)]
*  serious motion. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the... [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=176.8s)]
*  It's worse than that because it's the tail wagging the dog. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=177.8s)]
*  You know, one of the things I noticed in the opposition that they wrote to the gag order [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=179.64s)]
*  just a couple of hours before Judge Mershawn issued that gag order is they said all Trump [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  was doing here was trying to amplify defense arguments about Mershawn. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=188.72s)]
*  So in his post about Mershawn's daughter last week, they claimed that really what that was [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=193.16s)]
*  about was just trying to help his lawyers communicate to people how necessary recusal [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=197.44s)]
*  was. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=202.4s)]
*  I don't want to rehash exactly what he posted, but that was not the aim. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=203.4s)]
*  But here, what they're trying to do is conflate the political and the legal so that it all [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  collapses into one and take what would be opposition research in an ordinary political [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  campaign and sort of migrate it into this case and the Trojan horse of a recusal motion. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=215.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=220.32s)]
*  You know, there's always been this sort of... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=221.88s)]
*  There's these two universes, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Like we saw this in the litigation after the election 2020, which is they can make all [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=225.32s)]
*  the wild claims they want to and be hosted by Republican lawmakers and say all sorts [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  of crazy stuff. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=234.0s)]
*  As soon as those claims enter a courthouse, they got reduced to rubble. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=235.0s)]
*  What good does it do them to be doing this in a court, I guess is the question. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=238.56s)]
*  I think it's not that it does them any good in the court. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  It's that the court is the forum for their political campaign now, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=246.88s)]
*  All the courts are his stage effectively so that anything he says in court gets amplified, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=251.56s)]
*  repeated and becomes a part of his political messaging. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=258.4s)]
*  It's not about trying to obtain a particular result in a court of law. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=261.32s)]
*  It's about trying to obtain a result through the courts in our political system. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=265.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=269.0s)]
*  Because ultimately, he doesn't care about winning in the court. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=270.0s)]
*  He cares about winning the election because that's the only thing that will give him [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=273.64s)]
*  essentially the immunity and security from immediate prosecution and possible prison [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=277.2s)]
*  that he would otherwise be facing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  And perversely, I think he'd almost prefer to lose in these trial courts knowing that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=283.64s)]
*  it will help him electorally. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  And if he can only survive through November and prevail in the election, he doesn't have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  to worry about those initial losses. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=295.8s)]
*  Marshawn's not going to recuse. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=297.24s)]
*  Marshawn is not going to recuse. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=298.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=299.88s)]
*  These are Rubin. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=300.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=301.88s)]
*  From New York, I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=302.88s)]
*  The U.S.'s unwavering support of the Netanyahu-led government's war in Gaza has been a moral, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=304.08s)]
*  political and strategic failure. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=309.84s)]
*  And it is long past time to change course. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=312.36s)]
*  Israel's war in Gaza has raised for almost six months now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=315.6s)]
*  And one thing is abundantly clear. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=319.2s)]
*  Israel's far-right leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has no incentive to stop the catastrophe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  He needs the war to go on so he can remain in power. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=328.2s)]
*  Before the brutal Hamas deadly attacks on men, women, children, on October 7th, Netanyahu's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  long political career looked like it was crashing to an end. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=338.32s)]
*  In an effort to avoid criminal corruption charges, he launched an all-out attack on [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=342.64s)]
*  a cornerstone of Israeli liberal democracy, cracking down on the independence of its judges. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=346.56s)]
*  And that move spurred the longest, biggest protests in Israeli history. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=352.68s)]
*  Then in October, Hamas attacked. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=358.92s)]
*  They killed over a thousand people, most of them civilians in their homes, barricaded, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=361.24s)]
*  desperate at a concert. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=365.0s)]
*  They took more than 200 hostages back into Gaza. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=367.08s)]
*  And Netanyahu, the man that has long claimed the mantle that he alone could protect Israel, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=370.0s)]
*  oversaw the worst security failure in the nation's history. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=374.6s)]
*  And Israeli polling shows that people blamed him for it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=378.64s)]
*  But the political factions came together to form a wartime government, with Netanyahu [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=381.6s)]
*  at its head. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=385.36s)]
*  At least until Hamas was destroyed, the war could end and his legal and political fate [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=386.56s)]
*  could be decided. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=391.16s)]
*  That was almost half a year ago now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=393.12s)]
*  What has happened since then is a campaign that has been brutal in its civilian toll [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=395.52s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=399.68s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza forced en masse to flee their homes, over a million, million and a [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=401.32s)]
*  half. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=405.4s)]
*  Disease and deprivation and hunger run rampant. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=406.4s)]
*  Approximately 32,000 civilians are now dead, two-thirds of whom are women and children. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=408.48s)]
*  I should say 32,000 are dead, two-thirds of whom are women and children. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=414.2s)]
*  We're now at a point where just about every aid organization in the world, at least the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=419.0s)]
*  ones active in the region, are screaming that hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=423.8s)]
*  on the threshold of starvation. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=428.84s)]
*  Now, the Israeli government claims that there's no limit on aid going into Gaza. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=432.24s)]
*  Every organization involved in the provision of aid says that there's not enough getting [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=436.78s)]
*  in, that Israelis are slowing down aid and blocking it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  They are not allowing enough food into Gaza. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=444.08s)]
*  The international organization that assesses famine assesses the population of Gaza as [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=446.4s)]
*  at dire risk of starvation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  USAID Administrator Samantha Power has been saying not enough food is getting in for months. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=453.88s)]
*  We were just briefed by WFP officials who had just left Gaza about the catastrophic [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=461.64s)]
*  levels of food insecurity and the aid workers who on the ground in Gaza are risking their [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=466.36s)]
*  lives to get food to people in desperate, desperate need. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=471.76s)]
*  Those aid workers have to be protected. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  In fact, the U.S. has had to resort to the incredibly extraordinary step of air dropping [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=477.56s)]
*  food. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  This is usually only done in the most horrible conflicts when, for instance, your allies [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=483.24s)]
*  are surrounded, not the ones doing the surrounding. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=488.2s)]
*  It was used to get aid to embattled folks on the top of a mountain who are surrounded [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=490.96s)]
*  by ISIS. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=496.12s)]
*  Now, the food drops themselves are incredibly inefficient. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=497.12s)]
*  They proved insufficient. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=500.48s)]
*  So, then the next plan announced with great fanfare at the State of the Union, you remember, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=501.48s)]
*  was to build a temporary dock on the water on the Mediterranean Sea on Gaza's west coast [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=506.56s)]
*  where U.S. could help facilitate aid deliveries because the checkpoints are not allowing trucks [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=511.8s)]
*  through enough. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=517.04s)]
*  And in the meantime, the World Central Kitchen, founded by renowned chef Jose Andres, coordinated [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=519.04s)]
*  to build a kind of temporary version, a jetty, where food could come in by ship. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=524.82s)]
*  They ship through the Mediterranean and then be distributed in northern Gaza, which is [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=530.04s)]
*  where there is the most risk of famine, the hardest part to get food into. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=534.56s)]
*  Andres's charity has done similar work in all kinds of disaster areas after hurricanes [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=540.36s)]
*  and earthquakes and in war zones like Ukraine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  And just three weeks ago, he explained why he went to Gaza. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=546.8199999999999s)]
*  Of course, we should be bringing humanitarian aid by road. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=551.4s)]
*  Failure is a possibility. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=554.64s)]
*  But what we cannot do is use fail the people of Gaza. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=556.8s)]
*  That will be the true failure is not trying. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=562.42s)]
*  So we're trying. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=564.92s)]
*  So World Central Kitchen got tons of food. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=566.64s)]
*  I mean, literally tons of food. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=569.16s)]
*  They upload uploaded it from their ships. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=570.8s)]
*  They unloaded it from their ships and they sent it to the local headquarters for distribution [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=573.12s)]
*  in northern Gaza. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  And yesterday, a convoy of their trucks, marked as their trucks, left that warehouse driving [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  through northern Gaza. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  Their logo clear as day on the top and three of their vehicles were hit by air launch missiles [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  one after another, after another in quick succession. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  The first one being hit, people evacuating the injured into a second car, that being [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  hit and the third being hit. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  It killed seven aid workers, including Zomi Frankham, a manager of the World Central Kitchen, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=601.52s)]
*  actually appeared on MSNBC late last year. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  Today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike was unintentional and tragic. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=613.0s)]
*  Multiple Israeli defense sources have already told reporters the strike was a mistake, that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=617.64s)]
*  they did precisely target the aid trucks, knowing they were aid trucks because they [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=621.28s)]
*  thought there was a militant riding in it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=625.62s)]
*  The IDF releasing an official statement tonight saying, quote, it was a mistake that followed [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=628.8s)]
*  a misidentification at night during a war in very complex conditions. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=632.9599999999999s)]
*  It shouldn't have happened. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=637.56s)]
*  Today National Security Council spokesman John Kirby from the podium pushed back on [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=639.8s)]
*  reports the Israelis knew they were hitting an aid convoy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  Your question presumes at this very early hour that it was a deliberate strike, that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=647.76s)]
*  they knew exactly what they were hitting, that they were hitting aid workers and did [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=652.52s)]
*  it on purpose. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=655.4s)]
*  And there's no evidence of that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=656.4s)]
*  World Central Kitchen is now pausing, understandably, its operations in Gaza, saying the risk is [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=658.8s)]
*  just too great. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=663.28s)]
*  Other aid groups are pulling out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=664.28s)]
*  The risk of mass starvation looms as intense as ever. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=666.44s)]
*  And this all only ends when the Israeli government, which is led by Benjamin Netanyahu, says it [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=670.12s)]
*  ends. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=675.36s)]
*  And that is not sitting well with many Israelis, including many families of the October 7th [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=677.24s)]
*  hostages. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=682.12s)]
*  About 100 of their loved ones remain in Hamas custody in Gaza, again, in this besieged territory [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=683.12s)]
*  where they too are in danger. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=688.1s)]
*  And some of the family members of those hostages were among the tens of thousands of Israelis [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=690.96s)]
*  who took to the streets in massive protests against Netanyahu over the weekend, the largest [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=695.12s)]
*  since the attacks of October 7th. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=700.44s)]
*  There's been enormous pressure from many of the hostages' families to strike some kind [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=703.68s)]
*  of deal that releases the rest of them. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=707.32s)]
*  Again, the only mass release of hostages came during that first initial week-long ceasefire [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=709.2s)]
*  fairly early in the war. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=713.6s)]
*  But more durable ceasefire talks keep breaking down. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=715.52s)]
*  They broke down last month. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=718.2s)]
*  Some mediators in Qatar telling the Wall Street Journal they believed Netanyahu had sent [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=720.0s)]
*  negotiators to the talks without any real power to make a deal, undermining the talks, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=724.82s)]
*  Israeli officials disputing that notion. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=730.34s)]
*  Netanyahu, for his part, appears to be ready for more war. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=732.86s)]
*  Within hours of the news on the strike on aid workers, again, a precision strike where [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=736.0200000000001s)]
*  the munition goes through the logo of the world's central kitchen at the top of the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=739.5400000000001s)]
*  car, okay? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=744.74s)]
*  Israeli forces use their precision weapons to bomb an Iranian consulate in Syria, killing [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=746.5s)]
*  seven high-ranking military officials. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=750.9000000000001s)]
*  Now, consulates are off limits as a matter of international law. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=753.7s)]
*  One former U.S. official called that strike incredibly reckless. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=759.38s)]
*  It is raising fears of a wider Israeli war with Iran and Syria, a war that could quickly [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=762.6600000000001s)]
*  suck in the United States. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=768.02s)]
*  It's been clear since day one just what Netanyahu's political interest demands. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=771.1s)]
*  I mean, the failure, security failure of October 7th, the horror of it, the bone-deep horror [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=775.74s)]
*  of it was Netanyahu's fault. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=783.06s)]
*  He was the head of the state, and Israelis understood it as such. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=787.14s)]
*  And so his survival always depended on staving off the day of reckoning, right, for the war [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=790.5s)]
*  to stretch on as long as possible because the reckoning he has overdue is coming as [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=796.5799999999999s)]
*  soon as the war ends. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=800.66s)]
*  It comes on the day after. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=801.6199999999999s)]
*  So that's what his incentives are, and they have been. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=804.26s)]
*  President Joe Biden's incentives are to end the war, to broker a deal with Hamas, crucially, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=807.2199999999999s)]
*  to release the hostages, and then to figure out some kind of post-conflict equilibrium [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=811.7s)]
*  and trajectory that isn't just a descent into more catastrophic militant nihilism and humanitarian [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=818.6600000000001s)]
*  suffering. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=827.7s)]
*  Those two incentive structures, Biden's and Netanyahu's, cannot be reconciled. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=830.26s)]
*  And so instead what we get is this completely incoherent U.S. policy of embracing Israel [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=837.3000000000001s)]
*  in public and criticizing its actions in private, or in selling them weapons while saying things [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=842.58s)]
*  that they don't like the way they're doing. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=848.98s)]
*  A policy that Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official who played a role [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=852.82s)]
*  in the Middle East peace negotiations and has worked on the issue for decades, described [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=855.86s)]
*  today the New Yorker as passive aggressive, which is an understatement. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=859.46s)]
*  And on the same day Israel killed seven aid workers and struck an Iranian consulate, news [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=864.5s)]
*  broke that the U.S. is considering transferring another $18 billion in military arms to the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=871.06s)]
*  Israelis, including up to 50 F-15 fighter jets. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=876.98s)]
*  Israel is a sovereign nation. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=883.62s)]
*  It has probably the most powerful military in the region. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=885.54s)]
*  If they want to continue to pursue this war in this reckless fashion, they can do so without [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=888.98s)]
*  the active aid, assistance, and apologetics of our government. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RDw3Zk9Qg&t=894.9000000000001s)]
