# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Oct. 20
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU)
*  It is day 17 without a speaker of the House of Representatives after Republicans unceremoniously [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=0.0s)]
*  fired the last guy, Kevin McCarthy, at the beginning of the month. And with the House [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=5.28s)]
*  yet again in session today, we got yet another day of abject catastrophic failure by the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=9.84s)]
*  Republican Conference to meet the most basic minimal requirements of governance. Today began [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  with that man, Congressman Jim Jordan, as the Speaker Designate. That's a mostly made-up title [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=21.76s)]
*  that just means the Republican Conference voted him to be their nominee to be Speaker. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=27.36s)]
*  But even by the standards of this already disastrous and humiliating process, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=31.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's hand-picked candidate faced some very tough odds on the day began. Before today, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=36.16s)]
*  he had already lost two floor votes for the Speakership. In fact, as we told you last night, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=41.68s)]
*  he lost the second vote by more than the first, which some reports indicate may have been a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  deliberate strategy by his fellow Republicans in opposition to him to humiliate him on the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=51.28s)]
*  largest stage possible and make it appear, well, make it a reality, that he was losing support [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=57.04s)]
*  rather than gaining it. Now, Jordan spent most of yesterday trying to reverse that trend. But as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=63.36s)]
*  Punchbowl News reports, quote, every Republican who met with Jordan told him they would not back [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=68.08s)]
*  his candidacy for House Speaker. And it's not like Jordan and his allies were doing themselves any [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=73.52s)]
*  favors. As we have reported on this program, multiple Republicans told the press they received [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=79.12s)]
*  death threats for not backing Jordan. Those death threats only served to backfire, and it appears, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=84.08s)]
*  increase the resolve of certain Jordan opponents. Even as Punchbowl also reports, listen to this, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=89.52s)]
*  close Jordan ally Warren Davidson said, it's not Team Jordan's fault that holdouts are getting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=94.8s)]
*  death threats. They are getting the death threats, he said, because they voted against Jordan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=100.56s)]
*  I don't think anyone was really disputing that, to be honest. But Jordan was undeterred. He was [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=106.72s)]
*  back at it again today, trying to win the Speaker's gavel, starting with a strange, meandering press [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=111.92s)]
*  conference this morning that even Fox News had difficulty justifying. So that was Jim Jordan, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=117.28s)]
*  the Speaker, doesn't it, giving a press conference about the status of the Speaker's race. Doesn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=123.76s)]
*  look like he has support yet, Brian and Ainsley. I'm not sure what the purpose of the press [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=130.8s)]
*  conference was. He took questions from the folks, but it looks like he's still just trying to rally [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=136.56s)]
*  the troops. Okay. I don't know what the point was. Everything that we just learned, we knew, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=140.96s)]
*  except for that Jim Jordan is not quitting. That was the line at nine o'clock this morning, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  Jim Jordan's not quitting. The only thing we knew about Jim Jordan today was that he was not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  quitting. He was going up for a third crack of becoming Speaker of the House. Now, you'll never [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  guess what happened next. The total number of votes cast is 429, of which the Honorable Jim [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=162.88s)]
*  Jordan of the state of Ohio has received 194. The Honorable Hakeem Jeffries of the state of New York [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=170.72s)]
*  has received 210. It's such a funny recurring bit the Democrats do at all these votes. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=179.12s)]
*  They have more votes than the person they want and they all cheer. As you can see, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=192.88s)]
*  Jim Jordan lost again. Yet again, he lost by an even larger margin with more of his colleagues [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=196.56s)]
*  voting against him this time than the previous time, which was more than the previous time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=202.56s)]
*  In fact, he got the fewest number of votes from majority party nominee in a century. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=207.04s)]
*  Put that in your trivia database. After that humiliating loss, Republicans went back to one [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=211.2s)]
*  of their tense closed door family meetings where they held a secret ballot intra-party vote to see [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=216.4s)]
*  if Jordan should stay their speaker designate. Well, the conference decided to dump the three [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=221.84s)]
*  time loser, Jim Jordan. It is now over. Well, I guess for now, I mean, who knows with this process, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  but for now he's done for and the guy who created this mess is feeling the pain. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=233.04s)]
*  The most popular Republican in the United States Congress was just knifed by a secret ballot in a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=239.52s)]
*  private meeting in the basement of the Capitol. It's as swampy as swamp gets and Jim Jordan [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=246.08s)]
*  deserved better than that. I don't know if he's the most popular Republican in the conference, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=251.44s)]
*  but for most of the Republicans, the closed door meeting, it was that guy you just saw, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=256.64s)]
*  Matt Gaetz and his anti McCarthy Confederates like South Carolina's Nancy Mase that they were mad at. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=260.24s)]
*  Matt Gaetz has had very personal differences with Kevin McCarthy. So it was very personal [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=268.72s)]
*  differences, not legislative differences that led to this. And when he brought the motion and he [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=274.08s)]
*  was the person that brought the motion, you know, the end result of it is a very dangerous [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=280.08s)]
*  position that we're in as a country. To me, it reminds me how incredibly irresponsible it was [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=285.76s)]
*  for 208 Democrats and eight Republicans to put this house into absolute chaos without any kind [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=290.88s)]
*  of a plan for how we were going to move forward. Let's be clear, Nancy Mase, it's been a long time [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=296.96s)]
*  since she's done anything productive to move forward this broader team. I'll say what I'll [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=302.08s)]
*  pick somebody I definitely don't want to be speaker and I'll mention that name. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=306.64s)]
*  So where are we tonight? You ask? Well, good question. Republicans are back exactly where [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=310.08s)]
*  they started when they ditched Kevin McCarthy more than two weeks ago. In fact, after Jordan's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  series of massive defeats, you could argue they are even further away from electing a speaker when [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=319.2s)]
*  they were back then, because at least after they dumped McCarthy, his heir apparent, Steve Scalise [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=323.84s)]
*  became the speaker designate. Now Scalise was sort of the natural heir to the throne, but of course, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=330.08s)]
*  he couldn't get across the finish line either. And he didn't even try, dropped out after a day, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  basically. Jordan was quick to box him out for his own shot at the gavel. Honestly, I don't know [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=339.6s)]
*  what's next for Republicans. There's now like an open call for candidates, like they're putting up [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=345.92s)]
*  flyers to run for high school student government. There's like a slip you fill out to be like, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  oh, you want to be speaker? Sure. Yeah. If nothing else, I found, and again, I do this for a living, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=355.04s)]
*  but I'll be honest with you, I found it is a great chance to learn about some congressmen [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=361.04s)]
*  you may never have heard before. Like this guy, Oklahoma Republican, Kevin Hearn. He told reporters [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=365.2s)]
*  today he's running for speaker. He says he's the best choice because he's not a career politician. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=370.56s)]
*  That is true. Before getting elected in 2018, he built a hog farm. At one point, he also owned [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=374.48s)]
*  24 McDonald's franchises, as well as a company that manufactures furniture for fast food [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=379.92s)]
*  restaurants. He could be the next speaker. Or how about Michigan Republican Jack Bergman, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=384.96s)]
*  who's also running? You know Jack Bergman. You know him. You love him. Elected to Congress in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=391.04s)]
*  2016, following a lengthy career in the military, more than two decades as a commercial airline [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=395.68s)]
*  pilot. When asked if he regretted voting for Donald Trump's attempted coup after January 6th, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  Bergman told reporters, quote, hell no. And then there is the person I guess you would call the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  front runner-ish. That's that man. You know him right away. You got that name on the tip of your [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  tongue. That is Minnesota's Tom Emmer. Now, despite the fact that I'm guessing most of you've never [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=417.36s)]
*  seen this man before in your life, he is actually now the third ranking Republican in the House. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=421.76s)]
*  That makes him the establishment choice for whatever that means. Here's the thing about Tom [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=426.16s)]
*  Emmer. He voted to certify Joe Biden's victory after January 6th. He voted against the coup. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=431.44s)]
*  That means that he is on that one bright line, red line issue on the right side. He's also been [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=437.2s)]
*  mildly critical of Donald Trump in the past. The problem is that I think the MAGA wing of the party [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=441.92s)]
*  will not be a fan of him for that reason. Now, that's just a little bit of a roundup. Not even [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  all the candidates who either declare or are speculating about it. I think since I came up [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=453.12s)]
*  here, we've got a few more new ones throwing their hat in the ring. There are so many Republicans [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  you've likely never heard of who want to run the House of Representatives. Right now, they've all [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=462.16s)]
*  gone home for the weekend and there's an official candidate forum on Monday. So the list will likely [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=466.0s)]
*  only grow from here. And while I have to say, I don't often agree with Kevin McCarthy, I must admit [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=471.2s)]
*  it kind of hit the nail on the head today. Unfortunately, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  Jim is no longer going to be the nominee. We'll have to go back to the drawing board. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  What history will look at, the crazy aides led by Gates, the amount of damage they have done to this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=487.68s)]
*  party, into this country is insurmountable. I've never seen this amount of damage done to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=494.08s)]
*  just a few people for their own personalities, for their own fear of what's going through. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  And really, it's astonishing to me. And we are in a very bad position as a party. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=505.92s)]
*  Joining me now is NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent, Ali Vitale. You know, sometimes, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  Ali, I watch something happening in politics and I think to myself, maybe I'm just missing what [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=517.52s)]
*  they're seeing. Maybe they've got a strategy that I don't get. And I guess I sort of thought maybe [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=522.08s)]
*  that was the case with Jim Jordan's speakership bid when last we spoke 24 hours ago, where it was [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=526.64s)]
*  like, well, maybe he's got some trick up his sleeve. Doesn't look like it. What happened in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=531.76s)]
*  that meeting after the third failed vote? You'd be forgiven for thinking there was maybe some [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=536.56s)]
*  divine plan that you weren't read in on. Though I have to tell you, I learned a lot during your [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=541.68s)]
*  introduction, but I especially learned that even though I'm paid for this, I know way too many of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=545.5999999999999s)]
*  those obscure congressmen just by face alone. And so I clearly need to get out of this building. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  But the fact that lawmakers went home without making any progress whatsoever, I think is so [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=554.96s)]
*  striking. Jim Jordan goes into this meeting this afternoon. He's aware of the fact that he was [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=560.88s)]
*  going to put it to a vote within his conference yet again. The question was simple. Should Jim [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=565.84s)]
*  Jordan remain the guy that we go to the floor again to vote for? People had to vote yes or no, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=570.56s)]
*  and the no's won out. That then left them at the exact same place that we have frankly been [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=576.24s)]
*  time and again. And I think the only thing that this week has taught us is that this conference [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=581.28s)]
*  is ungovernable, completely unruly, completely factionalized. And I think that they were right [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=586.16s)]
*  early last week or maybe it was maybe it was the week before that when they said that they didn't [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=593.36s)]
*  know anyone in this conference who could get 217 votes. So maybe it's the fact that the 10 people [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=597.76s)]
*  who have their name on the list for wanting to be speaker right now, maybe it's good that those [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=604.56s)]
*  people are not the most popular or the most well-known because if you have 97% of the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=609.52s)]
*  conference behind you, like McCarthy did, like Scalise had slightly less of but still have the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  majority of, like Jim Jordan had, they still don't have the number that they need to become a speaker. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=621.04s)]
*  So what's the point? Maybe you don't want to be the most popular or well-known person in this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  conference. That's clearly not getting you anywhere closer to the gavel. So maybe you do need someone [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=630.8s)]
*  who's obscure and unknown, but I have no idea who that person would be. Yeah, I mean, it's such [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=636.32s)]
*  a good point. The history here, the last time he had something like this, Gingrich, who had to step [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=640.8000000000001s)]

*  sort of the next up lined up. Then it turned out, Bob Livingston also had an extra matter of affair, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  which came out. And then they went to a backbencher named Denny Hastert, who again was fairly [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=652.6400000000001s)]
*  anonymous, right? There's a whole other story about Denny Hastert there, but that's what happened the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=657.2s)]
*  last time. We'll see if we get our version of that this time. Ali Dutale, as always, great to talk to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=662.08s)]
*  you. Well, the key items President Biden said he secured during his trip to the Middle East this [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=666.8s)]
*  week was a commitment to open the Arafah crossing in Egypt. That's the one crossing that's not with [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=675.76s)]
*  Israel, to allow humanitarian aid to be sent into Gaza for the first time since Israel sealed the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=681.04s)]
*  border. But the 20 truck convoy carrying medical supplies, food and water, will be delayed at [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=686.72s)]
*  least another day. According to US officials, the highway has to be repaved before the trucks can [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=691.84s)]
*  cross into Gaza. Relief is desperately needed as the situation on the ground gets just grimmer by [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  the day. Food, water and electricity supplies were cut off nearly two weeks ago. And of course, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=702.4s)]
*  the Israeli airstrike continued. Hundreds of displaced Palestinians were sheltering at the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  oldest Greek Orthodox church in Gaza when it was hit by an explosion late last night. Israeli [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=712.96s)]
*  military said it had targeted a Hamas command center nearby. NBC News has not independently [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=718.72s)]
*  verified how many people died, but the Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry said at least [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=724.1600000000001s)]
*  18 Palestinian Christians were killed among them. Among them, according to former Michigan [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=728.48s)]
*  Congressman Justin Amash, were several of his own relatives who were sheltering at the church. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=734.48s)]
*  Joining me now is Sari Bashi, program director of Human Rights Watch based in Ramallah in the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=741.36s)]
*  occupied West Bank. Sari, can you talk to us about, I know you've been doing a lot of work on this, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=746.8s)]
*  about the situation in Gaza and what's needed? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  The situation in Gaza is quite dire. There are severe shortages of food, water, fuel and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  electricity. Hospitals are barely functioning. They're running out of medicine and they don't [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=764.0s)]
*  have enough electricity to perform basic functions. People in Gaza are down to three [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  liters of water per day for all uses, far less than the 50 liters a day that's determined as [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=774.56s)]
*  a minimum by the World Health Organization. And because the water has been turned off, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=780.4s)]
*  they're resorting to drinking brackish or salty water, which is unsafe for human consumption. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  The cutoff of the clean water that used to come in from Israel and the fuel needed to power [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=790.8s)]
*  generators and the electricity needed to power generators means that also sewage cannot properly [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=796.2399999999999s)]
*  be treated. The wastewater treatment plants are shut down, sewage is running in the streets. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=801.28s)]
*  There are significant concerns about a humanitarian crisis based on an epidemic of disease in addition [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=807.28s)]
*  to the more than 4,000 people who've been killed since the Israeli air strikes began. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  Just to be clear here, the fuel and water, there's probably no territory on earth quite like Gaza in [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  terms of who controls it and how it's governed. It's inside, it's controlled and governed by Hamas, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=828.48s)]
*  but they don't control the outside of the territory. What does Human Rights Watch believe [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=836.32s)]
*  should be done here? So Gaza is about the size of Philadelphia. It's 2.2 million people, nearly [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=843.6s)]
*  half of whom are children. It's surrounded on all sides by fences, walls, and the sea, which is [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  patrolled by the Israeli Navy. Water and electricity used to come in from Israel until [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=855.6s)]
*  two weeks ago when Israel cut off the taps. There's no reason that the Israeli government [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=860.32s)]
*  should not simply flick the switch back on and allow civilians in Gaza to resume drinking clean [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=865.9200000000001s)]
*  water and have the electricity they need to power it. It's an act of collective punishment to turn [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=871.28s)]
*  off the water and electricity and basically deprive children in Gaza of clean water. That's against [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=877.12s)]
*  international law. I'm concerned that the deal that Joe Biden brokered for 20 trucks to come in [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=883.92s)]
*  via the Egyptian crossing is painfully unambitious. There has been no talk of the need to simply turn [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=890.16s)]
*  the water and electricity back on to allow hospitals a submodicum of ability to function, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=897.68s)]
*  and no talk about reopening the crossings between Gaza and Israel for not just 20 trucks a day, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=903.28s)]
*  but the 100 trucks per day that aid agencies have said is the absolute minimum for Gaza. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=909.92s)]
*  In previous wars, brutal as they have been, the Israeli government has allowed trucks to come in [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=915.28s)]
*  through its own borders, which are much better established for that because of the dependence [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=920.7199999999999s)]
*  of people in Gaza on the Israeli crossings, and it has never cut water and electricity in this way [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=926.16s)]
*  during an active conflict. I mean, I think if an Israeli defense force, a spokesperson, were sitting [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  here, he would say something along the lines of, we've just suffered the most catastrophic [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=938.08s)]
*  violation of our sovereignty and security via those exact fences and border, and the security [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=942.24s)]
*  risk would simply be too high. I don't understand the security risk to turning the water and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=948.64s)]
*  electricity back on, and the reason that people in Israel around the world are so horrified by [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=954.16s)]
*  the October 7 attacks of Israeli civilians by Hamas-led militants is because they targeted [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=959.92s)]
*  civilians. They targeted children. So the answer cannot be to then target civilians, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=966.0s)]
*  target children in Gaza. Since the Israeli airstrikes began, more than 1,600 children in [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=971.52s)]
*  Gaza have been killed. We're talking about, on average, the Israeli military killing more [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=977.52s)]
*  than 100 children in Gaza per day. In addition, deprive those children of food, water, electricity, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=982.48s)]
*  and the fuel needed to power basic functions like the sewage system is not about defense. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=991.36s)]
*  It's collective punishment. It's punishing children for the acts of adult fighters. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=997.2s)]
*  Can I ask you a final- [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1001.84s)]
*  The U.S. government has an- [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1003.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1005.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. I just wanted to ask a final personal question. You're married to a Palestinian [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1005.6s)]
*  man. You're an American and Israeli Jewish. Your household and life lives across this [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1009.76s)]
*  conflict. You live in Ramallah. What has the last two weeks been like for your family? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1016.56s)]
*  The West Bank. And yes, it's been obviously very difficult. I think what's been heartbreaking is [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1025.6s)]
*  that the values that we try to impart to our children of universal respect for human life, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1031.36s)]
*  for human dignity that apply no matter who you are, are being flouted since October 7. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1037.2s)]
*  Hamas led attacks that killed so many children, massacring civilians, took civilians hostage, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1044.08s)]
*  were absolutely abhorrent. But the same people who deplore the murder and targeting of Israeli [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1049.84s)]
*  civilians, unfortunately, are not according the same concern for Palestinian civilians. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1056.96s)]
*  And particularly the United States, which is so active in brokering these deals, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1063.68s)]
*  has an opportunity to make a clear demand to the Israeli government to restore water and electricity [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1069.1999999999998s)]
*  supplies immediately and reopen its crossings to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. They've done it [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1074.08s)]
*  over fire in the past. They've done it in wars over the past. They can do it again. And that's [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1079.9199999999998s)]
*  what we need to protect civilians in Gaza. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  Sari Bashi, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I really appreciate it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiXlG5XK6jU&t=1087.04s)]
