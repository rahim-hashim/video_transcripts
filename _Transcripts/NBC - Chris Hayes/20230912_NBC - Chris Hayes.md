# Mark Kelly shreds Tuberville Chinese ‘popping champagne’ over military blockade
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM)
*  This is paralyzing the Department of Defense. You know, the idea that one man [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Senate can hold this up for months, I understand maybe promotions, but [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=5.64s)]
*  nominations is paralyzing the Department of Defense. I think that is a national [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  security problem and a national security issue. I was the head of the House Foreign [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=17.76s)]
*  Affairs Committee Republican Congressman Michael McCaul blasting Alabama [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=23.04s)]
*  Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville for his unprecedented military blockade in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=26.6s)]
*  the Senate. For over six months, the Republican has single-handedly blocked [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=31.68s)]
*  over 300 military promotions due to what he calls quote woke Pentagon policies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Now I gotta say I am quite sure if a Democratic Senator was doing this they [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=42.0s)]
*  would be absolutely dogpiled by their Democratic colleagues, but this from a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=45.52s)]
*  call appears to be the first sort of big public criticism for a prominent [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Republican congressman. We'll see if any others join to put pressure on the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=54.24s)]
*  Alabama Senator and his efforts to force pregnancy among other things on military [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=57.96s)]
*  members while also gutting the Armed Forces personnel. Senator Mark Kelly is a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=62.84s)]
*  Democrat of Arizona, he's a 25-year US Navy veteran who served as a combat pilot and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  now sits on the Armed Services Committee and he joins me now. What are the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=72.76s)]
*  conversations happening in the US Senate and on that Armed Services Committee [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=77.64s)]
*  about this blockade and what it what it means? Well I mean among my Democrat and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=82.0s)]
*  Republican colleagues I mean it's how do we how do we get through this you know [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=89.56s)]
*  let me first point out Chris that this is unprecedented. You know the Senator [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=93.6s)]
*  Tuberville has done something that has not been done in US history. I mean hold [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=97.68s)]
*  up nominations and promotions of admirals and generals for it's now been [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=102.48s)]
*  over six months and this has a serious negative effect on our national security. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=107.52s)]
*  I mean I was talking to one of my Republican colleagues today about just [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=112.36s)]
*  the consequences of this and and and they get it and it really comes down to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=116.0s)]
*  at some point here Senator Tuberville is gonna have to you know release these [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  holds because we cannot continue month after month. This is doing serious damage [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=125.88s)]
*  and it's not just short-term. It's this isn't like a light switch like you turn [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  it back on and everything's fine. This is gonna do damage to I mean to our [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=134.12s)]
*  military possibly for years to come. Michael McCaul criticized Senator [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=138.8s)]
*  Tuberville over the weekend and that's how we just played. Senator Amy Klobuchar [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=144.32s)]
*  was on this show last week basically saying we need Republicans to come out [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=147.72s)]
*  against this and I think if the shoe were on the other foot if there was a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Democrat doing this I think he'd probably start to see that criticism [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=154.56s)]
*  pretty quickly. Is that though is that how you map out the end of this which is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=157.4s)]
*  basically enough co-partisans pressure him enough that he relents? Well yeah [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=162.88s)]
*  that's what we've been waiting for and hoping for and I've had multiple [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  conversations with Republicans about you know putting pressure on them. We've been [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  putting pressure on them. This is you know I mean this is over a rather [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=175.64s)]
*  straightforward policy and and and Chris do you know like who is celebrating this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=180.6s)]
*  right now? You know the the Chinese government the Chinese military there's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=185.84s)]
*  probably in the Chinese Embassy here there's probably champagne corks popping [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=189.68s)]
*  over this. This is very good for them. This is very good for Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=193.72s)]
*  This is very bad for the US military. We've got to find a way forward. I just [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  want to be clear for folks that don't know this basically one of the his ask I [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=202.4s)]
*  think is to reverse a Pentagon policy that reimburses service members for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=206.24s)]
*  travel to secure reproductive care and and that is it long-standing policy for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=210.72s)]
*  health care so it's not even a new policy it just includes reproductive [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=219.28s)]
*  care. Now your your colleague in Arizona, Kirsten Sinema said we what we need are [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=222.48s)]
*  for folks to step off a little bit from their positions and find that middle [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=229.56s)]
*  ground to solve the challenge that we're facing appears to be middle ground [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=232.84s)]
*  between Senator Tuberville and the the Pentagon and the and the Biden [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=236.72s)]
*  administration. Do you think that's the way out of this? Yeah Chris I as you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=242.0s)]
*  mentioned I spent 25 years in the United States Navy. It is it is a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=246.0s)]
*  challenge personally and you know I've give so much credit for you know [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=250.72s)]
*  especially the young members in the military but folks that serve 30 [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=255.72s)]
*  something years 35 years that reach these you know the highest ranks in our [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=259.0s)]
*  military they have sacrificed their families have sacrificed it's a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=263.56s)]
*  challenge and you don't get to decide where you're gonna live I mean if [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=268.84s)]
*  somebody's stationed in Alabama or Mississippi and they can't get the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=273.08s)]
*  health care that folks can get in another state they can't choose not to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  go I mean we can't have a system where you know women that serve in our [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=280.88s)]
*  military are denied health care. And yet that seems to be the position of Senator [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=287.12s)]
*  Tuberville who is a quarter of one-man wrecking crew on this issue is there is [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=294.64s)]
*  there any escalation procedurally that you see happening here I mean obviously [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  unanimous consent to sacrosanct in the body in which you serve it gives each of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=303.44s)]
*  you individual senators power so you have a kind of game theoretical reason [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  to all like it but is there anything you can see happening? Well Chris at this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=312.44000000000005s)]
*  point I don't like it I mean it's it's been a mistake I mean that one senator [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  has the ability to do this much damage to our military I mean think about that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=321.72s)]
*  for a second I mean I know a you know I know a general in the Air Force who his [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=326.6s)]
*  his wife has just gotten over cancer he was planning on retiring and now he [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=332.28000000000003s)]

*  at something like I think the number is close to 90% of admirals and generals [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=391.06s)]
*  are gonna be unconfirmed we're gonna have a military that's not gonna be able [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5F4TBq50gM&t=396.02s)]
