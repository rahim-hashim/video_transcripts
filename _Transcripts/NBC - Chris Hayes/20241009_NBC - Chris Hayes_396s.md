Video Description: “These billion dollar disasters used to happen once every three months back in the 1980s. Over the last decade they’ve happened closer to every three weeks,” says Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at NOAA. “Climate change is certainly supercharging many of these trends.”

# Hurricane Milton: How climate change is ‘supercharging’ extreme weather trends
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ)
*  Adam Smith is an applied climatologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospherous Administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He's one of the country's leading experts on the cost of weather disasters, but Hurricane [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=5.0s)]
*  Helene was the first time he experienced one firsthand at his family's home outside of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=9.0s)]
*  Asheville, North Carolina. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=15.0s)]
*  And Adam, it's a great pleasure and honor to have you, and I just want to first ask [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=16.0s)]
*  how you guys are doing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=23.0s)]
*  We're doing okay, but certainly the last week and a half has been very challenging for the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=26.0s)]
*  entire community of Western North Carolina cities, really just torn apart, flooded, turned [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=31.0s)]
*  upside down by this disaster, which we never really expected it to peak and be as bad as it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=37.0s)]
*  has been. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=43.0s)]
*  Yeah, let me ask about that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=44.0s)]
*  Everyone that I've talked to from there or his friends and family from there, and I've [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=45.0s)]
*  talked to a bunch of people, they describe it in these sort of biblical terms, kind of like [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=49.0s)]
*  unthinkable, like a movie. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=54.0s)]
*  I mean, you're someone who studies this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=56.0s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=58.0s)]
*  I mean, a cataclysm is a rare word, but it's that bad. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=61.0s)]
*  It'll take years for us to rebuild so many communities, so much infrastructure. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=67.0s)]
*  Perhaps there's an irony. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=72.0s)]
*  We hope to learn from these different extreme events that hit all parts of the country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=74.0s)]
*  For example, over the last five years, there have been more than 100 separate billion dollar [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=78.0s)]
*  weather and climate disasters, all parts of the country from hurricanes to droughts to wildfires [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=82.0s)]
*  to flooding. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=87.0s)]
*  And back in 2004, right before I moved to Asheville, Hurricane Francis came through the last [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=88.0s)]
*  big flood. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=92.0s)]
*  They put the water pipes 25 feet below ground, the backup water pipes, those backup plans from [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=93.0s)]
*  what we tried to learn from Hurricane Francis in 2004, those were also washed away. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=99.0s)]
*  So it just shows us the 20th century and even 20th, 21st century infrastructure sometimes is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=103.0s)]
*  challenged by these extremes we're facing today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to show this chart. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=111.0s)]
*  This is what you study, full-time study for the civil service of our government, the cost of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=113.0s)]
*  weather disasters. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=118.0s)]
*  This is from your unity, Noah, showing the rise in billion dollar weather disasters. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=119.0s)]
*  And you see that top line there going up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=124.0s)]
*  Now, part of that is where we're building density. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=127.0s)]
*  It's not all climate. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=131.0s)]
*  But the costs here just seem like, I mean, just thinking about what the costs are going to be, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=132.0s)]
*  obviously, the human toll, the psychological toll, the health toll, but just the dollars and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=137.0s)]
*  cents of Helene and now Milton, it boggles the mind. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=143.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, with Helene and Milton now back to back, these once in a century events, first for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=147.0s)]
*  western North Carolina, second for the west coast of Florida again within two weeks, will be above [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=155.0s)]
*  $100 billion yet again this year. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=160.0s)]
*  These billion-dollar disasters used to happen once every three months back in the 1980s. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Over the last decade, they've happened closer to every three weeks. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=167.0s)]
*  So it just shows you responding to these in all parts of the country are increasingly difficult. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=171.0s)]
*  And the trends are really going in the wrong direction for all these hazards. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=176.0s)]
*  And climate change is certainly supercharging many of these trends. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, some of the numbers I saw out of the Helene and Nashville were just like [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=183.0s)]
*  incomprehensible. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=189.0s)]
*  The sheer amount of water, inches and inch feet of water in a short amount of time, the numbers [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=190.0s)]
*  are seeing from Milton. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=195.0s)]
*  Again, weather is a complex system. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=196.0s)]
*  Climate is a complex system. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=197.0s)]
*  Generally, though, it does seem like the arrows going in one direction, the more energy you pump [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=199.0s)]
*  in the atmosphere, the more you're essentially rolling loaded dice when it comes to these kinds [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=204.0s)]
*  of things. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=208.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=210.0s)]
*  We have more energy in the ocean. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=211.0s)]
*  We have more energy in the atmosphere. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=213.0s)]
*  So we're getting more explosive droughts and wildfires in the West. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=214.0s)]
*  We're getting more flood events for a warmer atmosphere, holds more water vapor, and therefore [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=218.0s)]
*  more rainfall in the East. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=222.0s)]
*  Six out of the last eight years, the United States, we've been hit by category four, category [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=223.0s)]
*  five hurricanes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=228.0s)]
*  That is a high such frequency on record dating back to 1851 for the top end storms. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=229.0s)]
*  And as you mentioned, yes, our exposure and our vulnerability are also compounding the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=234.0s)]
*  challenges we face in trying to manage our way to a more resilient future. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=239.0s)]
*  But whether it's wildfire drought, flooding, hurricanes, a lot of these events are being [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=244.0s)]
*  supercharged by climate change. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=249.0s)]
*  And our future is dictated by the decisions we make in the present. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=250.0s)]
*  Just at a personal sort of human to human level, someone who now I think you're not in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=256.0s)]
*  your home, you lived outside Asheville, if I'm not mistaken, you're not there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=260.0s)]
*  And you've got family members and community members, I imagine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=264.0s)]
*  What do you say to your fellow Americans about what this could look like if it comes [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=267.0s)]
*  for them or the folks that are preparing in Florida in the West Coast, on the Gulf Coast [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=272.0s)]
*  there? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=277.0s)]
*  I mean, even studying these events and you feel like you know them well, certainly they [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=280.0s)]
*  can shock you and surprise you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=285.0s)]
*  And that's what we're experiencing in Western North Carolina. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=286.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, in a few days, I think many people in the West Coast of Florida will experience [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=288.0s)]
*  that same sense of shock and loss in terms of what their lives and livelihoods used to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=292.0s)]
*  look like. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=297.0s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, I study this quite deeply and the trends are not linear. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=298.0s)]
*  They're becoming more exponential for the impacts in terms of not just dollars, but [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=303.0s)]
*  also the impacts on millions of people's lives and livelihoods. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=308.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, climate change is a multiplying force that amplifies a lot of these [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=312.0s)]
*  extremes into billion dollar disasters. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=318.0s)]
*  And I really wish just on a personal level, professionally and personally, that we would [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=320.0s)]
*  not see these trends. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=325.0s)]
*  But all signs really point to more of this happening in the future. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=327.0s)]
*  And so, yes, we need to learn from them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=332.0s)]
*  Make better decisions on the policy front and technological front. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=338.0s)]
*  And for our children and grandchildren looking forward to the future, what we do today really [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=341.0s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah, that post hurricane bearing the backup water lines 24 feet and that not being deep [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=348.0s)]
*  enough is a detail that is really going to stick with me as we think about what we're [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=354.0s)]
*  encountering and what we're going to have to mobilize across all society, the federal [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=358.0s)]
*  government, every level of government as we sort of start marching into this new era. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=362.0s)]
*  Adam Smith, I really hope that you and your family and the people in your life are good [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=366.0s)]
*  and everyone in the country is sending you the best possible wishes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=370.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51xCLpZxHlQ&t=378.0s)]
