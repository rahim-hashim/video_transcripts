# ‘Who voted for this?’: Trump guts funding for kids history contest
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4)
*  It is almost impossible to keep up with all the destruction being caused by Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=0.0s)]
*  even when it's your job to do so, like it is mine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Now, some of this we basically knew was going to happen, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=7.04s)]
*  He campaigned on it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=9.92s)]
*  But then there are the things that just never came up in the campaign that are now happening. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=11.44s)]
*  Some are cruel and seemingly pointless, things that make you wonder, who voted for this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=15.36s)]
*  For instance, who voted against National History Day? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=21.04s)]
*  It's a nationwide history competition that more than half a million students work to qualify [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=25.12s)]
*  for each year. And it is, well, awesome and adorable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=29.44s)]
*  In fact, this is a celebration that kicked off their award ceremony last year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=33.44s)]
*  You can see just how psyched all the kids are and how much they love it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  National History Day is a project-based learning experience for students in grade 6 through 12. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  They get to pick their own topic within the constraints of the theme and the time period. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=48.88s)]
*  You can do an exhibit. You can do a performance. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  You can write a traditional historical paper or you can make a website or documentary, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=56.56s)]
*  which are the digital versions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=61.6s)]
*  National History Day is a really amazing experience. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=63.36s)]
*  It's a great experience to learn about something that you're actually interested in. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=66.72s)]
*  I learned how to deep dive into a topic and learn more about how to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=70.56s)]
*  capture someone's personality and capture their whole story. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  It was just amazing to see other people excited about the same thing that I was. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=78.16s)]
*  I love being able to talk to people with different beliefs and from different parts of the country [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  and other countries too. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  You really get in this room and you see an entire room filled with exhibits. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  You realize they're not really your competitors. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  They're kind of the friends that you always wanted to have in high school. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=94.16s)]
*  I mean, come on. This is the most amazing, all-American, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=98.16s)]
*  wholesome, non-ideological, non-political thing I can imagine, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=103.44s)]
*  And if you look at any local news, seriously, over the past few weeks, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  you will see articles about students in places like Iowa or Texas or Mississippi or Ohio or [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=110.4s)]
*  Missouri or Pennsylvania proudly qualifying for their regional competition. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  And then once they clear that, they go to the big national competition, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  which was set to start in just nine weeks. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=125.12s)]
*  But last week, Donald Trump and Elon Musk killed its funding. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=128.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=134.32s)]
*  Who can say? Who the heck knows? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=136.08s)]
*  So the executive director had to take to social media asking folks to donate [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  so the kids can make it to the national competition in June. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  This means the loss of more than $336,000 over this year and next. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=148.56s)]
*  Now, part of that funding was to support the national contest. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=155.44s)]
*  So now we need your help. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  We need to raise in the next few months [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  about $132,000 to make history day happen in June. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=164.24s)]
*  Think about these numbers for a second. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  In the context of the federal government and Doge and Elon Musk, the world's richest man, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=172.32s)]
*  and the efficiencies they're bringing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=176.64s)]
*  $336,000 over two years? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=179.28s)]
*  Or $132,000 for the competition this year? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=182.88s)]
*  $132,000 is what they're saving, the taxpayer. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=186.96s)]
*  And that's all that is standing behind between these kids [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=191.12s)]
*  and this big national war that will imprint them for life. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=194.88s)]
*  Donald Trump could skip one golf weekend down in Florida, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=199.28s)]
*  and the savings could fund National History Day for decades. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk gets millions of dollars a day in federal contracts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=208.08s)]
*  I wonder if in the campaign, one of the candidates ran on the promise to destroy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=213.12s)]
*  a history contest for sixth graders if that would have affected anyone's decision. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=218.16s)]
*  Seriously, who voted for this? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_65n6zJfgO4&t=224.48s)]
