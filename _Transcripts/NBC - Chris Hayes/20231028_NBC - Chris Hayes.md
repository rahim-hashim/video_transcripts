# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Oct. 27
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA)
*  Scott Walker is a former hostage negotiator, as well as former counterterrorism advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=0.0s)]
*  of the United Nations, and he joins me now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=5.28s)]
*  Scott, I was watching the sort of plaintiff and agonizing entreaties by the families of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=8.16s)]
*  the hostages today in Washington. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=15.48s)]
*  Of course, they've held numerous events in Israel as well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=17.92s)]
*  There was this kind of pinprick of hope, I think, that's come from the fact that four [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=22.12s)]
*  hostages have been released, a dual-citizen American Israeli mother and daughter, and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=26.220000000000002s)]
*  then two women, Israeli women. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=30.82s)]
*  Can you give some context for what is happening right now, to the best of your knowledge, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=34.34s)]
*  the best as you can draw from your experience, in terms of those negotiations? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=38.7s)]
*  I think what we've seen so far demonstrates that the process that is in place is working. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=45.82s)]
*  We've seen four hostages come out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=52.3s)]
*  I appreciate there's over 200 being held, but it does show you that those negotiations [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=54.18s)]
*  are working and that the lines of communication, the trust that's being built between the Qataris [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=59.9s)]
*  in this case and the Palestinian and the Hamas leadership to secure the release of those [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=65.86s)]
*  hostages so far. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=71.14s)]
*  But we're far from over with this, and there'll be lots of coordination, lots of communication [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=72.54s)]
*  going back and forth between Israel, Qatar and Hamas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=78.1s)]
*  Obviously, the acts of Hamas in southern Israel were a war crime, and taking hostages is a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=83.14s)]
*  violation of international law. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=89.14s)]
*  The international law would compel an immediate and unconditional release of those hostages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=91.34s)]
*  They're not going to do that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=96.7s)]
*  Obviously, they have some value in negotiations. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=97.7s)]
*  Do you think there's an interplay between calculations about ground incursions or escalations [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=101.1s)]
*  there and the hostage negotiations? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=106.06s)]
*  Do you think those are on parallel tracks, or are they connected? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=108.62s)]
*  It's very difficult to say, but I think it is fair to say that Hamas will be in no hurry [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=113.14s)]
*  to release that many hostages right now because they serve a purpose for them in terms of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=120.06s)]
*  being a human shield and for bargaining, et cetera. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=125.66s)]
*  And it's also fair to say that any increase in military activity is potentially going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=130.02s)]
*  to increase the risk to the hostages, not just whilst they're being held captive, but [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=135.7s)]
*  actually the most dangerous part of a negotiation is the release and recovery phase where you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=140.82s)]
*  logistically, physically, you have to transport the hostages to safety. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=147.34s)]
*  Yeah, and in terms of the details of this, I mean, you have the Israeli spokesperson [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comparing Hamas to ISIS and the Nazis, that they seek [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=159.34s)]
*  their total destruction, that they will rid the world of Hamas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=164.62s)]
*  At the same time, there's some kind of back channel through an intermediary with Hamas [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=167.74s)]
*  to try to get the hostages back. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=173.3s)]
*  Is there a cutout such that no one's ever talking to each other face to face and there's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=175.86s)]
*  a go-between? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=179.46s)]
*  Qatari diplomats or some people like that that end up being the folks that are ferrying [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=181.02s)]
*  messages back and forth? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=185.46s)]
*  Well how it's done on the ground just depends on the facilities and the ability they've [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=189.38s)]
*  to have those communications, whether or not it's in person. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  But we know that Hamas leadership is in Doha, in the capital of Qatar, and so those conversations [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=196.94s)]
*  will be taking place whether or not they're over the phone or in person. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  You said at the beginning of this something that I think surprised me a little bit, which [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=209.26s)]
*  is that the release of four hostages to you based on your experience showed that there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=212.5s)]
*  was some progress being made. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=217.5s)]
*  Do you think that process can continue? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=220.5s)]
*  Well I certainly hope so and there's no reason why it shouldn't. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=225.46s)]
*  It just depends on how far they can get with the negotiations. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=229.3s)]
*  Just because you're negotiating with somebody with the hostage takers, it doesn't necessarily [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=233.1s)]
*  automatically mean that an agreement is going to be reached and hostage is going to be released. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=237.54s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=241.94s)]
*  There's so much going on in the background and in this context that makes it probably [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=242.94s)]
*  the most challenging kind of hostage situation you could ever come across. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=248.58s)]
*  What are the kinds of demands of alternate prisoner releases or things of that nature [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=252.78s)]
*  that happen when you talk about a negotiation, a back and forth, just generally speaking? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=262.5s)]
*  It depends on the circumstances and who the hostage takers are, but in this case, the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=268.7s)]
*  that it could be a bargaining tool, it could be to try and slow down any kind of ground [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=274.54s)]
*  incursion, prisoner exchange and also from Hamas's perspective to demonstrate that they're [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=280.54s)]
*  still relevant in the world. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=287.3s)]
*  We saw before October the 7th that Israel were about to sign a deal with Saudi for example [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  and actually seemed like the region was gradually moving on and so this is another opportunity [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=295.74s)]
*  for Hamas to demonstrate to the world that they're still relevant. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=301.74s)]
*  Alright, Scott Walker, thank you very much for sharing your expertise. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=304.98s)]
*  You've probably seen these images over the past three weeks pasted on lampposts and held [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=308.86s)]
*  up at visuals around the world. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=313.5s)]
*  The faces and the names of the more than 200 Israeli hostages taken by Hamas terrorists [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  when they attacked southern Israel and committed a mass atrocity, slaughtering men and women, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=320.7s)]
*  children and the elderly. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=325.42s)]
*  Unfortunately there have been a number of despicable incidents of people so full of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=327.74s)]
*  hate of Jews, they've actually ripped these images down as if that could erase the humanity [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=331.26s)]
*  of the people whose images are on them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=336.22s)]
*  And for anyone who lived through 9-11, those images bring back memories of the thousands [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  of flyers, the missing put up all over Manhattan in the frantic days after that terrorist attack [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  where so many family members left grieving. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=349.66s)]
*  And there was a small group of them that took that grief and turned it into action. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  They spoke out asking their country, our country, not to respond to the deaths of their loved [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=356.24s)]
*  ones with more violence. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=362.12s)]
*  They founded an organization called September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=364.16s)]
*  At that time in the wake of 9-11 supporting a nonviolent response to Al-Qaeda's mass murder [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=369.88s)]
*  was at the very fringes of public opinion. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=374.32s)]
*  And I remember being struck by the sheer grace, moral witness of those who had personally [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=377.26s)]
*  lost loved ones. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=382.7s)]
*  I also thought, as many did at the time, that was not how the world works. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=384.76s)]
*  Terrorists slaughtered Americans. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=389.36s)]
*  America had to respond with force. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=391.32s)]
*  But as the war on terror dragged on, thousands of American service members and hundreds of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=394.34s)]
*  thousands of civilians were killed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=398.56s)]
*  And radicalization spiraled into ISIS and a new round of brutal wars. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=401.52s)]
*  As all that happened, the call for peace and nonviolent solutions began to seem not just [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=406.44s)]
*  But in retrospect, wise. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=411.76s)]
*  Now there are Israeli families whose loved ones were murdered and kidnapped by Hamas [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  who have somehow found the same moral grace. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=419.32s)]
*  In her eulogy, the sister of one victim called on Israel to, quote, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=422.68s)]
*  The mother of a victim pleaded, quote, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=435.76s)]
*  Reservations about a full-scale ground invasion in Gaza have grown in Israel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=440.76s)]
*  Nearly half of Israel is now saying in a recent poll, it would be better for the military [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=445.76s)]
*  to hold off, to delay at least. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=449.56s)]
*  And today, the United Nations approved a resolution calling for a durable and sustained humanitarian [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=451.52s)]
*  truce. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=456.64s)]
*  Israel's government, though, as you heard, is vowing to destroy Hamas, saying they simply [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=458.76s)]
*  cannot tolerate the threat on their border. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=462.36s)]
*  And that is an understandable reaction in the wake of what Hamas did three weeks ago. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=465.6s)]
*  But the cost of a war to destroy Hamas will be enormous. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=472.6s)]
*  First, there is the human cost to Palestinian lives in Gaza, already more than 7,000 dead [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry there, which is run by Hamas. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  American Israelis says there's reason to doubt those figures, but every single piece of available [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=486.88s)]
*  information from Gaza, from reporters to NGOs to eyewitness accounts indicates an enormous [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=491.6s)]
*  and unprecedented human toll amidst the bombing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=497.12s)]
*  What is unfolding there in Gaza has become the most brutal humanitarian crisis in the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=501.68s)]
*  world, innocents, women, children, dying horrible and desperate deaths. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=505.16s)]
*  And there will be thousands and thousands of more lives lost if this continues. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=510.8s)]
*  The scope of civilian death already, the bombing, combined with a full blockade of basic supplies, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=516.0s)]
*  is simply not morally defensible. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=521.36s)]
*  Palestinian children, like Israeli children, both together deserve to grow up and to grow [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=524.92s)]
*  old and to live in peace, security, dignity and freedom. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=530.0s)]
*  Now you may say, well, the human toll is awful, but it is Hamas's fault. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=535.48s)]
*  They did this knowing full well what it would bring on to Gazans. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=540.0s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=546.7s)]
*  And if Hamas wanted to deescalate, they would immediately and unconditionally release the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=548.36s)]
*  nearly 200 hostages they took. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=552.46s)]
*  But if you think Hamas wants the spectacle of the mass death of Palestinians, of children [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=555.72s)]
*  in the rubble, then it is worth asking what will be achieved by giving them that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=561.16s)]
*  The deaths of civilians in Gaza buried in rubble are already echoing and will echo throughout [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  the region. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=572.0s)]
*  Further inflaming public opinion, likely drawing in other states and proxies already committed [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=573.24s)]
*  to harming Israel. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=577.38s)]
*  There is a real possibility of attacks expanding on Israel and on U.S. soldiers who are stationed [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=579.62s)]
*  in the region. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=584.54s)]
*  Not only that, Israeli soldiers will be facing enormous risk and peril. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=586.66s)]
*  If a ground invasion is happening now, as we believe it may be beginning, they will [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=591.74s)]
*  be embarking on some of the most dangerous urban warfare imaginable, facing an enemy [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=596.74s)]
*  that has an asymmetrical advantage to inflict maximal cost with minimal resources. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=600.9s)]
*  And then, what if the campaign is successful? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=607.26s)]
*  Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galan outlined one of the goals of this war as, quote, the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=612.46s)]
*  creation of a new security regime in the Gaza Strip, the getting rid of Hamas, replacing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=615.98s)]
*  it with some other entity. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=621.14s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=622.78s)]
*  Our experience in Afghanistan and Iraq tells us regime change, which is what they are discussing, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=625.74s)]
*  and again, understandably, is grinding. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=631.46s)]
*  It is expensive and brutal. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=634.34s)]
*  It is a vortex from which it is very difficult to escape. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=636.26s)]
*  In fact, reporting suggests that these concerns, what happens after, what about the day after, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=638.9s)]
*  are front of mind both in the Pentagon and Israel's own war cabinet. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=644.14s)]
*  And you might say to all of this, as many do, well, what's the alternative? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=648.46s)]
*  And I'll be honest, I don't know. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=654.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=656.98s)]
*  I do know that the most dangerous reasoning in policy is something must be done, this [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=658.5s)]
*  is something, therefore, it must be done. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=664.66s)]
*  Yes, this campaign of bombing and maybe ground incursion to Gaza is something. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=668.18s)]
*  But no, it does not need to be done. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=674.1s)]
*  And I fear, and many people with way more expertise than me fear, it will usher in far, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=676.52s)]
*  far worse. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=681.14s)]
*  And this time, we should listen more closely to those who are calling for peace, who are [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  calling for a ceasefire, and particularly to those still in mourning now, calling for [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=687.42s)]
*  no more civilian deaths on either side of the line. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHEe8SJpwyA&t=692.18s)]
