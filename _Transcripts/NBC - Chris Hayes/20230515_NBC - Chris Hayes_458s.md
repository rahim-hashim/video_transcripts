# ‘We don’t have a choice’: Sen. Markey on expanding Supreme Court to 13 seats
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY)
*  These days, it's fair to ask, who really is in charge in this country? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=0.0s)]
*  Because the momentous loss of the constitutional right to abortion, which has led to state [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  abortion bans across the country, came from a ruling by just five right-wing justices [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=9.72s)]
*  on the Supreme Court. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=14.36s)]
*  Last year's decision that Americans have a broad right to carry firearms in public, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=16.12s)]
*  which puts state restrictions on firearms in jeopardy, also came from the Supreme Court's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=19.92s)]
*  ultra-conservative majority. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=24.62s)]
*  And now President Biden is considering a radical move to end the Republican Party's dangerous [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=26.56s)]
*  hostage-taking on the debt limit by perhaps deploying the 14th Amendment, which requires [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=30.979999999999997s)]
*  the country to pay its debts, a move that would then almost certainly be challenged [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  at where else? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=40.56s)]
*  Our conservative Supreme Court. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=41.8s)]
*  These days, all roads lead back not to Congress or the president, but to those nine unelected [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=43.72s)]
*  justices, three of them appointed by Donald Trump alone. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=48.72s)]
*  And now a new study by four law professors estimates that Republicans are likely to keep [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  control of the court for another 42 years until 2065, unless the court is expanded and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=56.36s)]
*  rebalanced, which is precisely the goal of a bill that was first introduced in 2021 and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=64.92s)]
*  that would expand the court to 13 justices. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=70.12s)]
*  The bill's sponsors, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Congressman Hank Johnson [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=73.24s)]
*  of Georgia, plan to reintroduce that bill tomorrow. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=76.88s)]
*  And Senator Markey joins me right now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=81.12s)]
*  Senator, thanks for coming back on the show. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=83.32s)]
*  I've been banging this drum for years to expand the court. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=85.0s)]
*  Just out of interest, though, how did you arrive at expanding the number to 13 justices? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=88.92s)]
*  Why 13 and not, say, 11 or 15? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=93.48s)]
*  Well, the Republicans, Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, they were able to steal two Supreme [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=97.84s)]
*  Court seats, Merrick Garland's seat, and then a week before the election in 2020, just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=104.32s)]
*  jamming through Amy Coney Barrett. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  So they stole two seats. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=113.36s)]
*  And with it, they upset the balance on the Supreme Court. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=114.72s)]
*  So we need to expand by two in order to get back the two seats which were stolen and then [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=118.56s)]
*  two more seats in order to restore the balance that had existed on the court. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=124.16s)]
*  So we really don't have a choice. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=130.28s)]
*  It is constitutional. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=132.44s)]
*  There were only six Supreme Court justices when the country began. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=133.44s)]
*  Abe Lincoln actually expanded the court to 10 seats. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=138.04s)]
*  So it's within the constitutional purview of the United States Congress to determine [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=141.72s)]
*  how many justices sit. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=146.4s)]
*  And you're 100% right on the history and on the Constitution, but a common practical argument [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=149.8s)]
*  that many liberals, many of your fellow Democrats make against expanding the court, which is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=154.96s)]
*  if we do it, then Republicans will do it back to us when they get power back and where will [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=159.46s)]
*  it end? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=164.34s)]
*  What is your response to that very common argument? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=165.34s)]
*  Well the Republicans are the court packers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=168.32s)]
*  They did that in 2016. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  Then they expanded that one more time in 2020. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=172.2s)]
*  They stole two seats. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  So it's like the bully down the schoolyard. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=177.27999999999997s)]
*  If you let the bully keep stealing your lunch money, nothing's going to stop them in the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=180.33999999999997s)]
*  future. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=184.88s)]
*  So the only question is are we going to stand up to the bullies? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=185.88s)]
*  Are we going to try to restore the balance that did exist before they engaged in this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  ahistorical thievery of two Supreme Court seats? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=194.44s)]
*  I don't think we have a choice. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=197.88s)]
*  Otherwise the bullies will win over and over again. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=199.24s)]
*  They will never stop. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=201.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=203.72s)]
*  And they changed the size of the court whenever they liked. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=205.16s)]
*  They held it at eight for almost all of 2016 after Scalia died. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=207.12s)]
*  Senator, you and several Democrats in the House, in the Senate and House have called [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  for Clarence Thomas to resign, Justice Thomas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  In light of all the revelations around the gifts and lavish vacations he's received from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=217.0s)]
*  billionaire conservative activist, Harlan Crowe. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=220.88s)]
*  Why aren't more Democrats in the House and Senate demanding Thomas step down? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=223.4s)]
*  I mean, what is stopping the Democratic Party as a whole from saying this guy's got to go? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=227.44s)]
*  Well I think that Justice Thomas should resign. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=232.4s)]
*  And I think there's going to be an increasing chorus as each week, month, year goes by. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=235.72s)]
*  Tomorrow, in fact, on the steps of the Supreme Court, Planned Parenthood is going to come [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  to endorse my bill, as is NARAL because they can already see the catastrophic consequences [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=247.88s)]
*  of the Dobbs decision in changing abortion rights in our country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=254.86s)]
*  So I think there's going to be a growing chorus. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=260.26s)]
*  And I also believe that if the Supreme Court does not pass its own code of conduct, that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=262.74s)]
*  the United States Congress will impose a code of conduct on them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=269.42s)]
*  I think that increasingly it is clear that we need to lift the standards of this Supreme [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=272.98s)]
*  So just on that, Senator, Chief Justice Roberts declined a request from the Senate Judiciary [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=280.06s)]
*  Committee controlled by Democrats to testify about the court's ethics or lack of ethics [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=293.7s)]
*  code. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=298.54s)]
*  Shouldn't your colleagues on the Judiciary Committee ask Justice Thomas himself to testify [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=299.54s)]
*  and if he refuses, subpoena him? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=303.76s)]
*  But can they even do that when Senator Dianne Feinstein still can't really show up and do [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=306.62s)]
*  her job properly even now, even after returning to D.C.? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=310.02s)]
*  It seems to be a bit of a shambles on the Democrat-led Senate committee. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=313.2s)]
*  Well I think that Senator Durbin is doing an excellent job with the majority which he [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=317.22s)]
*  has knowing that Senator Feinstein has been away. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=322.9s)]
*  And I think he is putting together a very good strategy that is building the chorus [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=327.26s)]
*  towards a code of ethics being adopted by the Supreme Court or ultimately having the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=332.68s)]
*  United States House and Senate have to do it for them. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=338.72s)]
*  So I think Dick Durbin is doing a very good job and as each day goes by, as each new atrocity [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  emanates from this Supreme Court, I think that there is going to be a consensus that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=348.88s)]
*  action has to be taken. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=353.92s)]
*  And yet Senator, Dick Durbin has not called for Thomas to resign as you have, has not [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=356.36s)]
*  called for Thomas to testify. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  And recently he said history will judge the Roberts Court. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=361.64s)]
*  It's not history's job to judge, it's Senate Democrats' job to hold the Supreme Court accountable. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  Well it's why I'm introducing tomorrow with Congressman Hank Johnson, with 60 House members, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=370.76s)]
*  with senators, the Judiciary Act of 2023 to expand the Supreme Court. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=378.4s)]
*  We need to take action. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=383.36s)]
*  We need to repeal the filibuster, we need to expand the Supreme Court. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=384.88s)]
*  We have to deal with this constitutional crisis that has been created by the Republican [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=388.36s)]
*  usurpation of the Supreme Court. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's going to be the challenge of this time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=397.8s)]
*  And we can't agonize, we have to organize. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=399.6s)]
*  And I do believe that the momentum is growing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=401.88s)]
*  The revelations about Justice Thomas, the Dobbs decision, the Bruin decision in terms [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=404.8s)]
*  of concealed carry, the decision on the environment, other decisions that they're about to make [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  about democracy, they're all building a crescendo which in my opinion is going to point towards [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  the passage of the Judiciary Act of 2023. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=421.14s)]
*  I hope you're right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm glad you're introducing your bill. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  I hope the president gets on board because he's been very anti-court expansion. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=427.38s)]
*  I hope you get through to him, Senator. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=430.82s)]
*  Ed Markey, thank you so much for your time. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=432.86s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=435.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=436.14s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=437.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJjuDXcSiY&t=445.86s)]
