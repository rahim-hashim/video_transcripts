# ‘Pure thuggery’ Trump juror dismissed after ‘MAGA intimidation machine’ targets her
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The jury has been chosen in Donald Trump's New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=0.0s)]
*  election interference case. Twelve jurors, one alternate, are now seated and ready to decide if [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=4.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is guilty. Tomorrow, Judge Juan Marchand expects to finish selecting alternates, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=10.24s)]
*  five more of those are needed, ahead of opening statements which could come as soon as Monday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=15.68s)]
*  Now, none of this looks certain this morning when the third day of jury selection began [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=20.64s)]
*  with something of a setback. As of Tuesday evening when the trial left off, seven jurors had been [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=25.52s)]
*  sworn in, but by lunchtime today, two of those seven were dismissed. One of the dismissed jurors, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=31.28s)]
*  originally seated as juror number four, turned out not to have been entirely truthful in his answers [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  on the jury questionnaire, specifically about whether he has ever been accused or convicted [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=42.32s)]
*  of committing a crime. The DA's office actually discovered that someone with the same name as that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=48.0s)]
*  juror was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political advertisements. His wife was also involved [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=53.36s)]
*  in a corruption inquiry and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Manhattan DA's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=60.16s)]
*  office. After some further questioning, the juror was dismissed from the case. That seems, at least [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  from where we sit, like a sensible decision. The second dismissal of a juror today was really [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  troubling. And despite a barrage of media coverage, you may have already seen this today, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=76.72s)]
*  I actually think the facts of this matter have not quite sunk in. What actually happened is that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=80.64s)]
*  this juror became the target of the Trump, MAGA, and Fox intimidation machine because they suspected [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=86.08s)]
*  she would not vote to acquit the former president. And their targeting appears to have successfully [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=92.32s)]
*  led to her departure from the jury. Now, I'm not going to repeat much of this juror's identifying [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=98.8s)]
*  information. We've referred to her only by her profession. She is a nurse. But because of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=104.32s)]
*  extensive questioning of the potential jurors, the public nature of the court proceedings, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=109.52s)]
*  and the wealth of personal information available on the internet, it hasn't been that hard to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  identify these people. In fact, this issue was brought up in court today. Judge Mershan directed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=117.84s)]
*  the press to avoid physical descriptions of potential jurors and ruled that information [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  about their employers will be redacted from court transcripts. But one person took it to an entirely [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=128.24s)]
*  new and irresponsible level. Both Tuesday and Wednesday nights, devoting entire segments to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=134.32s)]
*  airing all the available information about the jurors and his opinion on whether they are suspect. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=140.0s)]
*  And of course, the only acceptable jurors are ones sympathetic to Donald Trump, jurors who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=146.16s)]
*  don't believe no one's above the law. So then the defendant himself went on to actually amplify [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=150.48s)]
*  Fox's coverage, posting a quote about undercover liberal activists lying to the judge to get on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=158.24s)]
*  the jury. There's no evidence that's true. The post appears to be a flagrant violation of Trump's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=163.84s)]
*  gag order, which prohibits him from commenting on jurors. And so this morning, Judge Mershan told [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=169.76s)]
*  the court that the original juror number two, the one that scares Mr. Waters, called and conveyed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=176.08s)]
*  that she had concerns about her identity becoming public, said that friends and family have already [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=182.32s)]
*  inquired about whether she is a juror. The juror added that given these outside influences, she [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=187.2s)]
*  was concerned about her ability to be fair and impartial. Understandably, after all that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=192.96s)]
*  information and those opinions about her got out into the world, she found herself feeling scared, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=198.72s)]
*  targeted and exposed. Judge Mershan agreed to excuse juror number two from duty. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=203.44s)]
*  Again, there's no doubt about what happened here. This is part of a long, consistent and persistent [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  pattern in which Donald Trump encourages and the MAGA world pursues the harassment, intimidation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=216.24s)]
*  of people who cross the former president. It has happened a ton. It's happened to several key [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=222.08s)]
*  figures in his legal cases. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has received all sorts of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  death threats, as has Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis and Judge Arthur Nguurhan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=231.28s)]
*  Remember the bomb threat called into his house who oversaw the civil fraud case in New York? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=236.08s)]
*  It's the same thing we saw happen to Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  Were dragged through the mud and were harassed to the point that Freeman had to flee her home [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=246.96s)]
*  because of false claims they were involved in election fraud. It is what happened to Republican [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=250.96s)]
*  Rusty Bowers, the speaker of Arizona's House of Representatives, who was terrorized in his own [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=255.6s)]
*  neighborhood after refusing to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results. Now that is exactly [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=259.76s)]
*  what is happening amid an attempt to administer orderly justice in a New York courtroom. It is [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=266.8s)]
*  pure thuggery, plain and simple. It's a violation of the gag order on its face and it's a scandal. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=272.64s)]
*  I don't think it was quite treated as such today in the way it should be. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  This trial is going to be a test of whether the system can stand up to the constant bullying [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=287.68s)]
*  intimidation that is the stock and trade of the MAGA movement. Now Fox won't face any repercussions [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=292.32s)]
*  for this bullying intimidation and they shouldn't. It's a free country. It's covered by the First [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=298.96s)]
*  Amendment. But inside that courtroom there have to be repercussions. Hey everyone, MSNBC has a new [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3MybKXWsg&t=303.67999999999995s)]
