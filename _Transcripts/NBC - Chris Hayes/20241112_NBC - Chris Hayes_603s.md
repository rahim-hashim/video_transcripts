Video Description: Chris Hayes: “I find the lesson of George W. Bush and Social Security reform illuminating here. Then as now, we have a Republican president-elect winning a thin majority of votes. And then as now they want to act as if they have a sweeping mandate to remake a federal institution that millions of Americans rely on.”

# Why Trump’s win isn’t a ‘mandate’ for the unpopular MAGA agenda
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and I want to start tonight by looking at something that happened the last time a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican candidate for president won the popular vote who was 20 years ago [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=6.4s)]
*  It is noon on the East Coast and 9 a.m. Out West and NBC News now projects George W [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=30.0s)]
*  Bush wins the 2004 presidential election and so now George W Bush by a margin of more than 3 million votes will serve four more years [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=38.72s)]
*  as president of the United States [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  It was widely seen as a decisive victory by the pundits a race that Bush won by just under a 3 million votes out of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=50.08s)]
*  111 million cast taking the popular vote by as you see just over 2% [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=57.12s)]
*  Now that's pretty close like it's pretty close to 50-50 a point that one new senator-elect from Illinois made on election night [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=62.24s)]
*  before the race was even called I [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=70.64s)]
*  Think that you know what's important as we move forward at? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=73.28s)]
*  Regardless of what happens at the presidential level and I'd give the same advice to John Kerry or President Bush [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=76.88s)]
*  I think it's really important at this stage to recognize that this is a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=83.44s)]
*  5149 country or a 50-50 country and that whoever's in power has to show a certain humility [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  And a recognition that they've only convinced half the people [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=95.2s)]
*  For us to move together. We need a much higher percentage of folks moving in the same direction [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=99.12s)]
*  A 50-50 country humility so said senator-elect Barack Obama on election night on Fox News in fact [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Now the race wasn't even called until the morning after the election as you saw there because of a close vote in the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=110.16s)]
*  Central swing state of Ohio if it had gone the other way Bush would have actually lost that election despite winning the popular vote [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=116.56s)]
*  It was even crazier because democrats had a massive voter turnout operation that had hit its numbers in Ohio and elsewhere [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=123.84s)]
*  The democrats thought they were going to mobilize their vote and get this huge new vote out and swap [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=132.48s)]
*  The republicans but in the end it was the republicans that mobilized a huge vote [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=137.04s)]
*  And it really was a it was it was a vote that a kind of vote that I haven't seen in Ohio before in terms of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=141.52s)]
*  The numbers of republicans and the margins they were producing in especially some of the rural counties [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=146.8s)]
*  Sound familiar. So how did bush win and how did he run up such big numbers in those rural areas? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=152.16s)]
*  Remember, this was only three years after 9 11 [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=157.76s)]
*  Americans were still kind of rallying around the flag and the wartime leader bush and claim the mantle of wartime president [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=160.32s)]
*  Launched the war in iraq declared famously mission accomplished in that indelible image [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=167.28s)]
*  Even as it was already when voters went to the polls becoming clear the invasion of iraq [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=172.48s)]
*  Was becoming a disaster [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=178.0s)]
*  Now immediately after that loss democrats began you'll never guess what? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=180.0s)]
*  soul-searching [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=184.88s)]
*  finger pointing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=186.48s)]
*  anxiously wondering [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=188.0s)]
*  How had they grown out of touch with middle america? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=189.84s)]
*  Lots of folks poured over a just released book by the great writer and social critic thomas frank [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Which became a huge bestseller called what's the matter with kansas and in it? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=197.68s)]
*  He detailed how republicans and conservatives used these sort of culture war fights and wild accusations against liberals [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=201.52s)]
*  As a bait and switch to win over working class and rural voters and get them to vote against their economic interests [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=208.0s)]
*  this great movement to the right [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=214.88s)]
*  That we've had over the last 36 odd years is so familiar [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  I think that probably everybody in this room has a conversion story that they can tell how their dad had been a union steel worker say [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=222.32s)]
*  A stalwart democrat, but how one day all their brothers and sisters started voting republican [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=230.72s)]
*  Or how their cousin gave up on methodism and started going to the pentacostal church out on the edge of town [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=235.92s)]
*  Or how they themselves just got so sick and tired of being scolded for eating meat [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=242.16s)]
*  Or for wearing clothes emblazoned with chief alina weck that one day fox news started to seem fair and balanced to them after all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  Some real echoes here, right 20 years later [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  And again against this backdrop republicans were triumphant and they painted democrats as these [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=257.52s)]
*  Terrorism appeasers as weak need is out of touch bleeding heart liberals clustered in urban enclaves and campus anti-war protests [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=262.86s)]
*  And they interpreted bush's reelection as a broad mandate for all of their craziest policy ideas [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=270.8s)]
*  In his first press conference after the election [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  President himself said as much [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  When you win there is a [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=282.48s)]
*  A feeling that the people have spoken and embraced [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=284.72s)]
*  Your point of view and that's what I intend to tell the congress you asked do I feel free? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me put it to you this way. I earned capital in the campaign political capital and now I intend to spend it [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  The second term agenda meant an expansion of the global war on terror overseas and at home [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=298.48s)]
*  It was a bonanza of privatization [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=303.28s)]
*  Of government functions the centerpiece of this agenda the first big way he was going to spend that capital [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=305.68s)]
*  Was a policy championed by the conservative heritage foundation might sound familiar [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=312.0s)]
*  It was a plan to privatize [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=317.68s)]
*  Basically all or at least part of sources security to make that federally guaranteed benefit, right that rock solid benefit [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=319.84s)]
*  You pay your whole life you get the money back more like a workplace retirement account [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  More like a gamble in the market [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  Now this had been a long-standing republican dream [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  Bush claimed the social security program was in crisis and would be insolvent in just over a decade [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  Voters were not interested in hearing that in fact the harder that bush and republicans pushed the less popular social security reform became in polls [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=342.56s)]
*  And so democrats on capital hell did something rare [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  They dug their heels in and they fought republicans tooth and nail [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=355.12s)]
*  In fact one aid to then house minority leader nancy pelosi recalls that nervous colleagues would ask her when the party's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  Alternative social security reform plan would be released and pelosi responded never does never work for you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=366.62s)]
*  So bush has just been re-elected republican house and a republican senate government trifecta and even with that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=374.08s)]
*  And even with the political capital he gained in his re-election even with all the takes afterwards about how america just hates the libs and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=380.0s)]
*  Republicans and conservatives are ascendant [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=387.68s)]
*  George w push could never even get his plan for privatizing social security to a vote on capital hill didn't even get a vote [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=390.56s)]
*  Because it was so radioactive [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=398.8s)]
*  It was an unpopular idea that no one had asked for and no one had really voted for right [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=400.96s)]
*  That 51 percent of the country's vote was george w bush. They weren't like please privatize our social security [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=406.72s)]
*  I mean outside of the heritage foundation, of course [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=413.04s)]
*  And that fight even contributed to democrats taking back the house in the senate in 2006 [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=416.0s)]
*  And I think you can see where i'm going here. The reason i'm talking about all this tonight [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=420.24s)]
*  Is that there's something brewing similar? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  Here with donald trump something similar that recalls what happened [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=427.68s)]
*  the president-elect [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=432.24s)]
*  Laid out something in a video yesterday regarding his plans [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=433.76s)]
*  Which are embodying project 2025 on how he will essentially overhaul the education system [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=437.36s)]
*  And that plan of course is to abolish the department of education [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=443.92s)]
*  it is a goal very much like privatizing social security that has been a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=448.0s)]
*  Fever dream of republicans for decades. This is not new [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=452.8s)]
*  It of course requires congressional approval. In fact, the heritage foundation has a plan for liquidating the department and assigning its functions to other departments. It's all [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=456.24s)]
*  Drawn out in that project 2025 blueprint [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=464.48s)]
*  And it is not popular. Okay [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=468.56s)]
*  Just one bit of polling data umass amherst poll late last month found six and ten respondents oppose [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=471.2s)]
*  Elimiting the department of education firing civil servants replacing the political appointees loyal to the president [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=477.12s)]
*  Now all of this looks like it's going to be happening. I mean [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  We're starting to see the signs of it despite the fact the department of education [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=487.44s)]
*  Overseas all the 1.6 trillion dollars in federal student loans americans have borrowed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=490.32s)]
*  It enforces civil rights and education. It collects vital statistics on enrollments [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=495.28s)]
*  staffing crime that schools nationwide rely on and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=499.36s)]
*  it administers billions in federal grants to support america's poorest students as well as [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=503.04s)]
*  And here's something I think you're going to hear a lot about [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=508.56s)]
*  students with special needs [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=511.52s)]
*  Now if you have a student in your family that relies on special education or has a iep an individualized education program [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=514.0s)]
*  That's thanks to the department of education [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=521.92s)]
*  They are the funding source [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=524.64s)]
*  Hear me now for every iep in the country [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=526.32s)]
*  Every single one comes through that department [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  And I would like to know how many millions of voters are in families that rely on those ieps [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=534.72s)]
*  The reason republicans have dreamed of abolishing the department of education [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=544.08s)]
*  But never actually done it is because it will disrupt the lives of millions of families and kids [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=546.96s)]
*  In ways they will remember forever [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=554.0799999999999s)]
*  So I find the lesson of george w bush and social security reform illuminating here then as now [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  We have a republican president-elect winning a thin majority of votes and then as now they want to act is that they have a sweeping mandate [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=563.28s)]
*  To remake a federal institution that millions americans rely on like all of a sudden a majority [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  Decided the heritage foundation was the way to go [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=575.04s)]
*  There's going to be a fight on that and that is a fight that democrats. I think would love to have [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=578.4s)]
*  You [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOEHS7c0Bc&t=583.68s)]
