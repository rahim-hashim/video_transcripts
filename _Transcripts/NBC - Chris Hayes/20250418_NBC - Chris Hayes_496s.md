# 'I felt afraid': Lawyer who traveled with Van Hollen to El Salvador details trip
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4)
*  Chris Newman went with Senator Van Hollen to El Salvador. He's the legal director of the National Daily of Organizing Network [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's representing the family of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and he joins me now [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=5.32s)]
*  It's good to have you on the program. I know that you weren't at the meeting itself between [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=10.24s)]
*  Mr. Abrego Garcia and the senator, but you were down there you traveled down there with the senator first [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=15.32s)]
*  I just what was it like your interface with the government of El Salvador as you were alongside the senator? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=20.1s)]
*  Well first Chris, thanks so much for having me on the show [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=30.44s)]
*  I can tell you that I've been traveling to El Salvador for years [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=33.2s)]
*  And this is the first time that I felt fear and all of my time there and particularly fear of Bukele's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=37.2s)]
*  government [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  The I think the single most important thing that happened was [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=46.24s)]
*  Exactly as you said the bravery that and the action that senator Van Hollen took in actually [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=50.96s)]
*  Physically going to see cut to try to demand access to Kilmar as is required by [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=56.9s)]
*  International law and human rights the one little quibble [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=63.26s)]
*  I would have with the way you characterized it is I wouldn't say that it's the single best act of resistance [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=66.9s)]
*  I would say maybe it's the second [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  best act of resistance behind Kilmar himself and the reason I say that is because Kilmar is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=74.22s)]
*  exhibiting courage that I think we're all drawing from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=80.14s)]
*  And he's not just trying to liberate himself [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=83.66s)]
*  He's trying to defend defend the Constitution for all of us [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=86.54s)]
*  And so I think the senator and I sort of summoned the courage that Kilmar [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=90.62s)]
*  His wife Jennifer and his mother Cecilia have shown in standing up to what is really a turning point [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=95.42s)]
*  Where the country is not just on the brink of fascism, but we've entered and crossed the Rubicon [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=102.14s)]
*  My understanding is that you were with the senator when he attempted to go into see caught and were barred from that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=108.16s)]
*  Despite the fact that a multiple Republican members of Congress had been escorted through earlier [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=114.72s)]
*  Can you tell me about what that what happened there? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=119.7s)]
*  Yeah, you know I've been to see cut before I was actually there when they first [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=123.92s)]
*  Opened it so I was familiar with the area [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=128.68s)]
*  The senator and and I were detained by military police with m16s [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=131.8s)]
*  And we weren't permitted it was sort of the equivalent of like being stopped on the 10 freeway [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=139.4s)]
*  In Los Angeles and we were turned away hundreds of other cars passed by either way on the road to San Vicente [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=144.44s)]
*  But but we were told that and they were a little bit sort of oblique and how they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Characterized it, but essentially they said we weren't allowed to go further [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=157.78s)]
*  Under the orders of President Bukele himself [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=161.28s)]
*  My understanding is that you were advised to leave earlier than the senator [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=165.0s)]
*  And and there was some concern [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=169.52s)]
*  I mean, I think some people had some concern when senator say he was gonna go down [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  About his own personal safety about the legal regime down there, but that you were advised to leave for you know [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=176.12s)]
*  Out of caution about your own legal status down there [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=181.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know I talked to Congressman Jim McGovern before who is like a hero of mine [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=185.12s)]
*  Because he's led delegations to El Salvador for decades [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=191.56s)]
*  And he told me and I hope it's not a transition for sharing [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  That this is the first time that if something were to happen while people are down there the US government is not [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  going to help us [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=205.36s)]
*  And so when you know I was traveling with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=207.72s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen well first I mean I should say you know I made a commitment to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=211.2s)]
*  Cecilia and to Jennifer that I would do everything that I could to make sure that Kilmar was alive to make sure that he was safe [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=216.24s)]
*  And to make sure that he had access to counsel [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=222.96s)]
*  But I made a commitment to my to my partner that I wouldn't go to that prison unless I was standing with somebody who is essentially [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=225.28s)]
*  Unarrestable and that was in this case [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  Senator [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=235.68s)]
*  Van Hollen when he left and we and we sort of parted ways at the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=237.4s)]
*  At the hotel that was the first moment actually that I felt afraid I was by myself [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  I was away from my family in another country and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=249.52s)]
*  For you know for a couple of moments. I was worried about whether I would be able to freely go home and see them [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna. I'm gonna give you a characterization that Stephen Miller gave of your character [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=259.16s)]
*  characterization that Stephen Miller gave of your client and I'm not gonna play the tape because I honestly I think it's sort of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=265.12s)]
*  He's a famatory [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=272.72s)]
*  But because you are representing the family and his wife [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=275.44s)]
*  He referred to him as a criminal wife beating terrorist illegal alien [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  And I as your as a lawyer for the family for him and for his wife. I'd like to hear your response to that I [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=285.04s)]
*  Mean as you as you say this is I mean [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=291.2s)]
*  racist defamation coming from the most powerful office in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=294.68s)]
*  The country or in the world from somebody who I think sits higher on Trump's organizational chart than the vice president himself [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=298.96s)]
*  But their falsehoods and all we ask is that Kilmar be able to defend himself in court and in the court of public opinion [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=307.52s)]
*  In court and in the court of public opinion [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=316.36s)]
*  Kilmar is not a gang member. He's a union member [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=320.68s)]
*  He's not a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=324.32s)]
*  Terrorist he's in fact a political prisoner. He's not a violent person. He's a loving father [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=326.12s)]
*  and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=333.52s)]
*  unfortunately the Trump administration is administering justice and trying to irrigate power as if this was an episode of like a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=335.28s)]
*  dystopian episode of like the black mirror and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=342.8s)]
*  apprentice [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=346.36s)]
*  They're staging things [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=347.52s)]
*  They're you know engaging in a campaign of lies and I think it's distorting the the discussion [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=349.44s)]
*  I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak to your viewers. I wish a similar invitation would be [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=355.84s)]
*  extended from Fox News and OAN and the other [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=361.88s)]
*  News agency or news agencies probably the wrong way to describe it [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=367.08s)]
*  But but the the people who are amplifying all of these lies and defamatory lies about Kilmar and his family [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=370.92s)]
*  The White House today through several social media accounts [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=380.0s)]
*  Basically said that he's never coming back. I think there's a post where they edited in the New York Times headline [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  I believe if I'm not mistaken the Attorney General United States Pam Bondi said something similar now the Supreme Court has [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=392.0s)]
*  Ordered the government to facilitate his return that that's not ambiguous. They said he's never coming back [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=399.28s)]
*  Do you think that's sending a message to the Supreme Court that they don't care what the Supreme Court says? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=406.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know I'm not counsel on the litigation [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  He's represented by some of the best lawyers that I know and I don't want to comment on that litigation specifically [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=417.96s)]
*  but what I will comment on is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=424.48s)]
*  You know, we're grateful that that President Trump doesn't get to have the last word in this [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  Conversation in this matter. He might think he does he might try to arrogate power [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=434.2s)]
*  Like I said, I think there are others like, you know, the eminent professor Chmurinsky who have argued [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=438.88s)]
*  I think correctly that we are currently amid a constitutional crisis [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=444.08s)]
*  We've gone past that that that Rubicon, but it's not up for Trump to say [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=448.24s)]
*  We are fighting first and foremost for Kilmar safety [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=453.84s)]
*  Secondly for his due process and third for his peaceful return to his family to his community [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=458.28s)]
*  And to his union brothers and sisters [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  All right, Chris Newman who is an attorney for the family of Kilmar of regular Garcia who is still detained in El Salvador [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=467.8s)]
*  Thank you for your time tonight. Appreciate it [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=474.48s)]
*  You [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6J16fS_vI4&t=483.2s)]
