Video Description: GOP Rep. Nancy Mace has managed to become a high-profile member of Congress.

# ‘Craven’ Leaked staff handbook reveals GOP rep’s thirst for attention
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE)
*  In a very crowded field of craven House Republicans, there is one who stands out among the rest, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=4.4s)]
*  Now, Mace has managed to become a high-profile member of the Republican House caucus in less [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=6.24s)]
*  than three years on the job. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=10.76s)]
*  And that has a lot less to do with her record or accomplishments than her uncanny ability [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=12.88s)]
*  to find a camera. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=16.98s)]
*  In fact, Nancy Mace does not seem to have any real fixed ideology. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=17.98s)]
*  Instead, it tends to shift in whatever direction the cameras are moving. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=21.56s)]
*  For example, Mace was an early supporter of Donald Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=25.8s)]
*  She even worked on his 2016 campaign. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=28.8s)]
*  But the relationship went sour after Mace criticized his attempted coup and Trump endorsed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=31.6s)]
*  her primary opponent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  The congresswoman reacted with a cringeworthy media stunt flying up to New York to film [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  this video. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=42.28s)]
*  Hey everyone, Congresswoman Nancy Mace here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=43.28s)]
*  I'm in front of Trump Tower today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=46.28s)]
*  If you want to lose this seat once again in midterm election cycle to Democrats, then [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=48.56s)]
*  my opponent is more than qualified to do just that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=53.28s)]
*  Now Mace's name is rumored to be on the Trump shortlist for vice president, a possibility [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=58.0s)]
*  she calls intriguing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Then there was the Republican speaker debacle. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=64.48s)]
*  Mace joined the very small group of rebels that voted to overthrow her own ally, Kevin [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=66.52s)]
*  McCarthy, citing his lack of action on women's issues, including birth control and abortion. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=71.04s)]
*  She promoted all the backlash she received for that vote, sporting a scarlet letter in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=76.0s)]
*  front of the press. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=80.6s)]
*  Nancy Mace then turned around and supported Jim Jordan and later speaker Mike Johnson, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=82.2s)]
*  both hardcore opponents of abortion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=86.08s)]
*  This is all part of her plan, as Jake LaHut explains in this fascinating new profile on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=89.76s)]
*  the Daily Beast. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=94.24s)]
*  Quote, for Mace, what seems to matter most isn't what kind of attention she gets, just [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=95.24s)]
*  that she's at the center of it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=99.12s)]
*  Jake LaHut is a politics reporter for the Daily Beast and she joins me now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=101.16s)]
*  Jake, you got your hands on some briefing materials that staffers have to sort of give [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=104.92s)]
*  to other staffers about like what the congresswoman likes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=110.64s)]
*  These exist in a lot of office. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=113.56s)]
*  What did you learn from that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=115.24s)]
*  So first I want to give a shout out to my colleague Sam Brody, who has a ton of experience [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=116.24s)]
*  on the Hill and had, you know, a greater familiarity with these. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=121.6s)]
*  But I first heard about this handbook when I was reporting on Nancy Mace inserting herself [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=125.44s)]
*  into the, you know, entirely premature beefsteaks that Trump was having. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=130.76s)]
*  And I really wanted to track it down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=135.88s)]
*  Once we got it, what really stood out to me was that this is really a lot of like consultant [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=137.6s)]
*  buzzwords and kind of vague terms about, you know, what all amount to driving a national [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=143.68s)]
*  narrative. That's the recurring theme throughout it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=151.36s)]
*  The other interesting thing is that the job descriptions for communications related roles [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  tend to be like two or three times longer than, say, the legislative director or the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=159.08s)]
*  deputy chief of staff, you know, really significant positions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=163.84s)]
*  And the third thing that stood out was that no matter what your job title was, and again, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=166.96s)]
*  this was for the handbook this year in 2023, you were required to pitch one tweet a day, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=171.4s)]
*  minimum. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=178.6s)]
*  And so she sort of had this like all staff writer's room dynamic going on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=179.6s)]
*  And, you know, the goal is just to kind of live new cycle to new cycle. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And obviously you're writing a book about the attention economy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=188.44s)]
*  And I think, you know, she's certainly an example of one way to do it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=191.16s)]
*  Put it that way. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=194.68s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=195.68s)]
*  This is up my alley because I'm writing a book on this on this topic. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=196.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's very funny to think of like them all sitting around like staff council being [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=200.2s)]
*  like, all right, I got one, you know, warning, Joe, you know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=203.64s)]
*  So so here's here's the TV hits proportion of the of the handbook staffers on the communications [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=208.44s)]
*  team were told they needed to book Mace on a national TV outlet between one and three [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=214.0s)]
*  times per day per day, a staggering times per week at a minimum, according to former [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=218.44s)]
*  staffers who had seen past handbooks and on local TV channels at least six times per week. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  That is a shocking amount of time on TV. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=228.28s)]
*  And I say this as someone who has a TV show. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=229.92s)]
*  Also, she wants to be known as a thought leader, which is a term that that itself is the opposite [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=233.6s)]
*  of thought in a strategy memo she wrote in twenty twenty one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=239.84s)]
*  Mace described herself as the freshman thought leader on federal issues, according to a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=242.88s)]
*  copy of the Daily Beast. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=246.72s)]
*  She even gave herself a brand name National Nancy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=248.0s)]
*  Now, she can do this now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=251.16s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, she was in a swing seat and got redistricted into a safe seat. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=252.68s)]
*  Right. So like she could kind of do whatever she wants now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=257.48s)]
*  Is that the deal? So I'm still confused by the status of South Carolina redistricting [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=260.0s)]
*  and don't want to speak out of turn there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  But I do think that when the initial redistricting went from swinging to more Trumpy, what I'm [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=269.0s)]
*  not sure on is what the future of it is with the core challenges that have happened there [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=273.76s)]
*  and all that. Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=276.88s)]
*  Basically, you know, and I think a member like Elise Stefanik would be a comparable [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=278.16s)]
*  where one you realize that where all the small donor energy is, is obviously with the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=282.48s)]
*  MAGA messaging. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  The other thing that I think is just true about our Citizens United era and how small [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=289.04s)]
*  donations have become the name of the game is that you really just want to have that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  household name, that recognizable face and be able to try to just, you know, drawing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  some donations. I think what's different about the recent period we've seen is that she [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=302.56s)]
*  basically torched any goodwill she had left on Capitol Hill by being one of the McCarthy [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=307.32s)]
*  eight. So I think that's left her in a very precarious position. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=312.76s)]
*  And, you know, again, it was it was interesting to hear her say on The Daily Show that she [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  was, you know, intrigued by the V.P. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=323.76s)]
*  speculation as if that was news to her when, again, you know, we reported and have it on [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=325.68s)]
*  pretty good authority that she's basically the only one pushing that around. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=329.96s)]
*  Aside from ties with Trump adviser Chris LaSavita, like that's it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=334.08s)]
*  Yeah, this, by the way, this is a former staffer is talking about that vote to house, which, by [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=339.96s)]
*  the way, when I read the part about like staffing up on comms as opposed to legislating, I [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  thought about Madison Cawthorn, who bragged about that famously, that he built his staff around [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=347.88s)]
*  comms, not legislating. Madison Cawthorn, no longer a member of Congress because he was [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=352.36s)]
*  basically turfed out by Republicans who had enough of his stuff and successfully primaried [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=356.88s)]
*  him. This is a staffer talking about that vote to oust McCarthy, one of eight in the House [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=362.08s)]
*  Republican caucus in the eyes of former staffers. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  She saw the votes on the board and said, F it, I'm just going to vote for it just so I can [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=368.88s)]
*  TV and talk about it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=373.32s)]
*  A former senior aide said you should write that quote on the gravestone of American [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=374.76s)]
*  democracy if it comes to that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=380.36s)]
*  Jake LaHutte, great reporting. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yGmlpNwUE&t=383.36s)]
