# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0)
*  Donald Trump's challengers for the Republican presidential nomination are struggling to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  find their footing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=4.92s)]
*  This weekend, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign ended Pride Month by [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=6.42s)]
*  sharing a video that was widely panned as homophobic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=10.58s)]
*  The video is set to club music with rainbow filters. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=14.16s)]
*  It shows Donald Trump at various points in his presidency expressing support for the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=17.5s)]
*  LGBTQ community, despite his long record of curtailing their rights. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=21.76s)]
*  The video then celebrates DeSantis' own crackdown on LGBTQ rights promoting headlines that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=26.26s)]
*  call DeSantis' policies draconian. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=32.54s)]
*  The DeSantis campaign stunt was met with quick condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=35.64s)]
*  The log cabin Republicans, a conservative pro-LGBTQ group, called the video divisive [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=41.540000000000006s)]
*  and desperate and said it ventured into homophobic territory. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=47.1s)]
*  The most prominent openly gay member of Trump's administration, Richard Grinnell, called the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=51.18000000000001s)]
*  video undeniably homophobic. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=55.46s)]
*  And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had this to say in an interview on Sunday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  The video is the latest attempt by a Republican presidential contender to try to win over [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  Trump's base of diehard MAGA extremists. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  But Trump's base has proven time and time again that they are not easily courted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  Consider Senator Lindsey Graham, who has spent the last six years as a loyal Trump foot soldier. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=98.38s)]
*  Well, this weekend, Graham appeared alongside Trump at a campaign event in his home state [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=102.97999999999999s)]
*  of South Carolina. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=107.41999999999999s)]
*  And this was the welcome he got from that Trump-supporting crowd. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=108.94s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome United States Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=113.46s)]
*  Thank y'all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=121.66s)]
*  Welcome to Pickens. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank y'all for coming. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=133.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=136.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  Every campaign strategist's nightmare. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=140.26s)]
*  Joining us now are former Republican Congressman Carlos Corbello and Politico White House correspondent [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=142.06s)]
*  and Playbook co-author Eugene Daniels. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  Carlos, let me start with you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  How much do base Republican voters actually want their candidates to go after the LGBTQ community? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=153.26s)]
*  Look, Simone, there is a segment of the Republican primary electorate that finds this in some [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=159.45999999999998s)]
*  way attractive, can get behind this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=167.66s)]
*  It is a minority of the Republican electorate, but Rhonda Santis is clearly trying to do [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=169.66s)]
*  everything possible to catch up with Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=174.66s)]
*  Now, at the end of the day, this is a fool's error. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=177.66s)]
*  Number one, it's wrong. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=179.66s)]
*  It's very divisive. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=180.66s)]
*  And, you know, Donald Trump, for all of his flaws, I can tell you from personal conversations [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=181.66s)]
*  with him, doesn't have anything against the LGBT community, believes in equality. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=187.66s)]
*  And for Rhonda Santis to attack him on this when there are so many issues to attack Donald [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump on is just a shame. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, politically, the problem is that in a general election, swing voters in swing states [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  and swing districts outright reject this kind of rhetoric, this kind of divisiveness, this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  kind of speech. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  So while Governor Santis might be trying to do himself a favor in this primary, trying [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  to pick up some votes wherever he can, he's really setting himself up for failure if he [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=219.06s)]
*  actually gets past the primary. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=224.06s)]
*  You know, the Santis is for way, if you will, wading into these divisive waters that he [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=227.06s)]
*  regularly swims in, if we're just going to be honest. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=234.06s)]
*  It's like red meat for the 35 percent. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=237.06s)]
*  Then you've got folks like former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=240.06s)]
*  And I think that he recently had one of the better Republican answers when it came to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=243.06s)]
*  discussing the LGBTQ community. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=248.26s)]
*  He framed decisions about trans health care for children as a parent's decision and not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=250.26s)]
*  the government's. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=255.26s)]
*  And I frankly think that he demonstrated you can give an answer that doesn't contain red [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=256.26s)]
*  meat. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=263.26s)]
*  Can you survive a Republican primary that way though, Carlos, in this particular climate? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=264.26s)]
*  These days, it really doesn't seem so, Simone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=269.26s)]
*  It's an experiment. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=272.26s)]
*  Chris Christie is conducting it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=273.26s)]
*  He's not getting a whole lot of traction right now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=275.46s)]
*  But, you know, again, for all of his flaws, you hear Donald Trump out there talking about [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=278.46s)]
*  abortion, for example, criticizing Ron DeSantis for the six week ban in the state of Florida. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=283.46s)]
*  Even someone like Donald Trump, who has obviously adopted many extreme positions, understands [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=289.46s)]
*  what it takes to win and understands that you can't disqualify yourself entirely in a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=295.46s)]
*  general election by taking these extremist positions, by saying things that swing voters [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  in a lot of those districts that, since the Republican trifecta of 2016 have gone Democrat, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  well that's going to continue as long as Republicans keep following this Ron DeSantis playbook. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  It isn't even the Donald Trump playbook anymore because Trump is rejecting some elements of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's playbook is so interesting to me because on one hand, he's saying that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  about Ron DeSantis and on the other, he's saying, I overturned Roe. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=330.86s)]
*  It just makes no sense. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=334.86s)]
*  That's the Republican primary. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=335.86s)]
*  Eugene, there is not a Democratic primary because Joe Biden has decided to run for re-election, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=336.86s)]
*  so he is the Democrats' nominee. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=341.86s)]
*  Now, the White House, the President is running his campaign and the White House has said [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=343.86s)]
*  that the President is going to continue to govern while he is doing this election situation. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=349.86s)]
*  And I'm wondering about that strategy amidst what is a very tense political climate and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=356.06s)]
*  in a time where turnout is going to be the key when it does come to the general election. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=364.06s)]
*  At the center of their message is that he is the person who put his hands on the wheel [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=369.06s)]
*  and if you didn't like Donald Trump, he kind of eased things down a little bit in the country. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=374.06s)]
*  That is at the center and his governing, him being President, being at the White House, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=378.06s)]
*  that's at the center of that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=382.06s)]
*  So that's part one. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=383.06s)]
*  And so you've seen some of these events that they've done a little bit, but they've been [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=384.26s)]
*  mostly policy events, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=388.26s)]
*  They did the event about Roe v. Wade. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=390.26s)]
*  They did an event around his economic message with a bunch of unions talking about that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=393.26s)]
*  That is what it's going to look like, I'm told, and that you're not going to see him [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=399.26s)]
*  out in the streets as much as maybe some folks would want him to. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=403.26s)]
*  They often, we were talking right before we came on, they talk about how Barack Obama [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=406.26s)]
*  ran for re-election in 2012. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=410.26s)]
*  And they say it'll look more like the Obama strategy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=412.46s)]
*  Exactly, and these are two very different types of politicians. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=415.46s)]
*  It is a very different time period in American politics and Donald Trump was not running [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=418.46s)]
*  in 2012, right? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=423.46s)]
*  Ron DeSantis was not running in 2012. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=424.46s)]
*  And so you have Democrats a little nervous. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=426.46s)]
*  They've been wanting to see him out there. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=428.46s)]
*  They've been wanting him especially to see him more fundraising, more seeing Vice President [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=430.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris, the principals, Joe Biden and Doug Emhoff out there fundraising more. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=434.46s)]
*  They've been doing more of that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=439.46s)]
*  I wouldn't expect a lot more to kind of satiate those people who are a little nervous until [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  the end of this year going into the beginning of next. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=444.65999999999997s)]
*  So we see, especially Donald Trump, you know, Donald Trump is, whether people want to accept [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  it or not, he is right now the front runner. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  Now I do think things can change the way you run a presidential primary is delegate by [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=456.65999999999997s)]
*  delegate, state by state. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  And Chris Christie is kind of gay in New Hampshire, so we'll see what happens there. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  But Donald Trump's strategy has still been these huge rallies. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't see him doing a lot of retail politics. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=469.86s)]
*  So do you think that there's room in this primary for a Republican who may be good at [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=472.86s)]
*  retail politics to edge out Donald Trump? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=477.86s)]
*  What are other Republicans saying out there? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=479.86s)]
*  Yeah, there could be, but the difference is in the Republican Party, you both have to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=483.86s)]
*  be good at the hand wringing and that politicking, but also speak like someone like Donald Trump. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=487.86s)]
*  Speak to the base of the Republican Party. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=493.86s)]
*  And there is not a candidate at this point who is good at the hand shaking and kissing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=497.06s)]
*  babies and also that is charming and voters really like them and can give that red meat [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=501.06s)]
*  to the base. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=509.06s)]
*  Ron DeSantis isn't it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=510.06s)]
*  Chris Christie, he is not liked by the base of the Republican Party. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=511.06s)]
*  And so finding someone who can toe that line at this point in this primary process doesn't [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  exist. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  Carlos, I mean, it's such an important point. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  And I mean, we've got a big test coming up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  The August debate, right, is the first big test, a question of whether folks will stand [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=525.26s)]
*  on that debate stage again end of August. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=530.26s)]
*  But then you've also got no labels out there because they are still threatening to mount [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=533.26s)]
*  this third party campaign. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=536.26s)]
*  I understand the notion of giving people who don't like the two party system options, but [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=538.26s)]
*  I personally think what no labels is doing is slightly disingenuous. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=543.26s)]
*  And I mean, their main argument is that they will drop their bid if Joe Biden is polling [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=547.26s)]
*  ahead of the Republican nominee in the spring. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=552.46s)]
*  We all here know there will be no Republican nominee in the spring. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=555.46s)]
*  So how do you think no labels just will affect the primary process for the Republican Party [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=558.46s)]
*  going forward? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=567.46s)]
*  Well, it's hard to predict because this is kind of a new exercise. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=568.46s)]
*  I mean, it's been done a few times in the past. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=573.46s)]
*  But right now, Simone, if you look at the polling, you almost have to forgive a group [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=576.46s)]
*  like no labels for pursuing this because most Americans do not want another head to head [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=581.6600000000001s)]
*  between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  The numbers are there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  They're clear. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  Most Americans reject those two choices. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  So no labels believes that this is the election to try this, that this is the time where it [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  might work. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, the concern that many have, it's true. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  This could benefit Donald Trump if it does split Democrats. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=604.0600000000001s)]
*  In the GOP primary, I don't think this effort is going to have much of an impact. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=608.66s)]
*  I don't think voters are going to contemplate this as they go to the polls early next year. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=613.66s)]
*  The big question, Simone, and you mentioned this debate that's coming up in August. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=619.66s)]
*  Can anyone break through? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=623.66s)]
*  Can anyone distinguish themselves from Donald Trump in a way that does not alienate the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=624.66s)]
*  Trump base, which people need a portion of that base in order to win? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=629.66s)]
*  Is there a new dynamic candidate? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=633.66s)]
*  I'm biased. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=635.66s)]
*  I'm from Miami, like Mayor Francis Suarez, who might be able to convince people that [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=637.26s)]
*  it's time to just turn the page and try something completely different. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=643.26s)]
*  We have a rec. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=647.26s)]
*  We're wanting out there. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=648.26s)]
*  I mean, these are all unique candidates out of the mainstream for now. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=649.26s)]
*  But I think that's really the only type of candidate that can break through. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=654.26s)]
*  I don't think these candidates that are trying to follow Donald Trump to the nomination [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=658.26s)]
*  are going to succeed. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=662.26s)]
*  And I don't think the anti-Trump approach is going to succeed either. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=664.26s)]
*  So someone needs to try something different and they better figure it out soon. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=668.26s)]
*  Well, the clock is ticking. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=672.26s)]
*  Debates matter, folks. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=674.26s)]
*  I can't wait till the end of August. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=675.26s)]
*  Carlos Cabello and Eugene Daniels. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=677.26s)]
*  Thank you both very, very much. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=679.26s)]
*  We can move forward as a country and embrace the notion that we're all going to be judged [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=682.26s)]
*  not on the color of our skin, but on the content of our character and in this case on our GPA. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=687.26s)]
*  Am I understanding you saying there in that answer that you do not believe there is racial inequity [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=693.26s)]
*  in the education system in America? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=698.26s)]
*  I just, I really don't believe there is. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=701.26s)]
*  I believe there was. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=703.26s)]
*  I mean, there may have been a time when affirmative action was necessary, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=704.26s)]
*  simply to open the doors of all of our schools and universities. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=709.26s)]
*  But I think that time has passed and we'll continue to move forward as a colorblind society. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=714.26s)]
*  A colorblind society. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=720.26s)]
*  That concept was the central struggle of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down race-conscious admission policies last week. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=722.26s)]
*  Now, on the campaign trail and elsewhere, the takeaway seems to be we have achieved some kind of colorblind nirvana [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=729.26s)]
*  that race-conscious solutions to systemic social inequities actually disenfranchise white people. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=735.26s)]
*  So we should be race-neutral or colorblind, like presidential candidate Mike Pence suggests. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=740.26s)]
*  To bolster this argument in the court's majority opinion last week, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=746.26s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts cited Jim Crow-era Justice John Marshall Harlan, a man often called the Great Dissentor. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=749.26s)]
*  Roberts pointed to a specific section of Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 as a separate but equal case. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=756.26s)]
*  Harlan wrote, quote, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=764.26s)]
*  Our Constitution is colorblind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=766.26s)]
*  And in part for that reason, the court found affirmative action in violation of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=771.26s)]
*  But that Roberts majority opinion happened to skip this part of Harlan's 1896 dissent. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=779.26s)]
*  Right before the colorblind Constitution sentence, Harlan writes, quote, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=786.26s)]
*  The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country, and so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth, and in power. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=790.26s)]
*  So I doubt not it will continue to be for all time if it remains true to its great heritage and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=799.26s)]
*  A colorblind Constitution on one hand and a, quote, dominant race on the other, two diametrically opposed concepts on the same page. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=809.26s)]
*  So this contradiction was actually laid bare in a new Atlantic piece co-authored by Ibram X. Kendi, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=818.26s)]
*  author of How to Raise an Anti-Racist and founder of Boston University Center for Anti-Racist Research. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=824.26s)]
*  Dr. Kendi writes, quote, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=831.26s)]
*  The colorblind often see their color as superior, as Harlan did. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=833.26s)]
*  In the actual world, an equal protection clause in a Constitution can be transfigured by legal fantasy, yet again to protect racial inequity. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=837.26s)]
*  History repeats sometimes without rhyming, race neutral is the new separate but equal. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=845.26s)]
*  Then the fantasy was that separate facilities for education afforded to the races were equal and that actions to desegregate them were unnecessary if not harmful. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=851.26s)]
*  Today, the fantasy is that regular college admissions metrics are race neutral and that affirmative action is unnecessary if not harmful. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=861.26s)]
*  Now that racial neutrality is the doctrine of the land as separate but equal was a century ago, we need a new legal movement to expose its fantastical nature. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=870.26s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, professor and founding director of the Center for Anti-Racist Research at Boston University. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=879.26s)]
*  Dr. Kendi, thank you so much for being here. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=887.26s)]
*  And I appreciate you writing that piece because I'm trying to make this case to my team over the weekend. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=890.26s)]
*  And they were like, hmm, I don't know. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=894.26s)]
*  I said, well, somebody going to write it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=896.26s)]
*  And you definitely did. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=897.26s)]
*  Black and Latino students, they are still underrepresented in many of our country's most selective public universities. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=899.26s)]
*  But the Supreme Court believes that we are ready for a race neutral or even a color-blind approach to admissions that excludes affirmative action. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=907.26s)]
*  You call this a legal fantasy in the Atlantic. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=915.26s)]
*  Why is it a legal fantasy? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=919.26s)]
*  I think it's best to contextualize it how it was a century ago in which you had those litigants who were trying to desegregate schools, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=921.26s)]
*  schools who were going up to the Supreme Court and that Supreme Court was telling them that these schools were separate but equal, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=935.26s)]
*  even though study after study showed that Black schools receiving far and away less resources from states like Mississippi and Georgia and South Carolina than segregated white schools. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=945.26s)]
*  Similarly today, you have Supreme Court justices claiming that the only race-based admissions factor is affirmative action. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=958.26s)]
*  But as you've already talked about, if you look at legacies that provides racial preferences for white students, the same thing with, for instance, children of employees. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=969.26s)]
*  White people are overrepresented on the staff and faculty of colleges and universities. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=979.26s)]
*  So that gives preferences to their children. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=985.26s)]
*  It also includes white people are more likely to donate to these institutions and the relatives of donors also get a boost in admissions. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=989.26s)]
*  Even standardized tests, which primarily show the wealth or the income of the parents of the test-takers. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=997.26s)]
*  And we have a massive racial wealth gap. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1005.26s)]
*  To me, it's a fantasy that we have race neutrality other than affirmative action, just like it was a fantasy a century ago that the schools were separate but equal. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1007.26s)]
*  So you write that we need a new legal movement to expose race neutrality as a fantasy. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1018.26s)]
*  What is the new legal movement? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1024.26s)]
*  Well, I think it starts with your previous guest, who is actually demonstrating that legacy is actually not, quote, race neutral, that it actually gives preferences to white students. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1029.26s)]
*  And we start to look at some of the other admissions factors to demonstrate that they are leading to racial inequities and disparities. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1042.26s)]
*  And I think that's what we have to show. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1053.26s)]
*  We have to demonstrate the outcome of these policies and be less focused on whether they have racial language or even the intent of the policymaker. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1055.26s)]
*  Well, you talk about the outcome in California and in Michigan. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1064.26s)]
*  Affirmative action was already outlawed for their public universities in the 90s and in the early 2000s, actually. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1068.26s)]
*  So black enrollment at top schools in those two states, they plummeted. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1076.26s)]
*  It was rapidly. I believe it's about 50 percent. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1080.26s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about the broad long-term consequences of that kind of drastic drop in representation of students of color in these institutions. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1082.26s)]
*  Well, when black, Latino and indigenous students are underrepresented as they are at the top 100 most selective institutions, that also extends into the graduate programs. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1092.26s)]
*  Then they become underrepresented in the graduate programs. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1106.26s)]
*  And whoever is underrepresented in the graduate programs are also likely to be underrepresented in the professions like doctors and lawyers or even on the Supreme Court. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1109.26s)]
*  And so it sort of filters through throughout society when black and brown and indigenous students are being excluded from college admissions because of the admissions factors. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1121.26s)]
*  You know, it's going to then lead to other elements of society. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1133.26s)]
*  In the affirmative action ruling, the Supreme Court made a carve out an exception, if you will, for military academies in her dissent. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1137.26s)]
*  Justice Katanji Brown Jackson writes that the majority decided affirmative action was fine if it meant preparing, quote, underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1146.26s)]
*  What do you make of this exception? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1157.26s)]
*  I mean, it just goes to show where particularly black people and other groups of color are accepted. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1159.26s)]
*  So we're accepted when we're putting our lives on the line for the United States. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1171.26s)]
*  We're accepted when we're entertaining people. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1177.26s)]
*  We're accepted when we're serving people. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1180.26s)]
*  But for whatever reason, we're not accepted when we're trying to be professionals, you know, and build wealth like other groups. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1182.26s)]
*  You know, it really strikes me that we are having this entire conversation. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1189.26s)]
*  The Supreme Court is taking these actions that they have taken in the wake of an attack on teaching our nation's history in schools all across the country. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1194.26s)]
*  There's been a concerted look at critical race theory, and I'm using quotes because not actually what is happening in schools across the country. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1204.26s)]
*  Books are being banned. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1213.26s)]
*  In the summer that George Floyd was murdered, it really seemed like everyone was just, your book was flying off the shelf. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1215.26s)]
*  Everybody's trying to figure out how to be anti-racist. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1223.26s)]
*  Companies were hiring DEI, opening up DEI initiatives. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1226.26s)]
*  There were a lot of diversity dollars, as I like to call it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1231.26s)]
*  But three years later, many of those initiatives have dried up. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1234.26s)]
*  Your books, for example, have been banned in several states, actually. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1239.26s)]
*  And now the Supreme Court thinks we have achieved color blindness. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1243.26s)]
*  You've got Republican politicians celebrating it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1246.26s)]
*  What is happening here? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1249.26s)]
*  And are you surprised by how far the pendulum has swung in such a short amount of time? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1251.26s)]
*  I think taking the long view of history, I'm not surprised. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1259.26s)]
*  Because when we look at American history, whenever we have achieved or sought to achieve equity, whenever we have put in place anti-racist policies like affirmative action that have been proven to close racial disparities in colleges and universities, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1263.26s)]
*  the typical response historically, like currently, has been that these policies are actually the problem, that these policies are somehow anti-white. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1283.26s)]
*  And so you've had this pretty concerted movement to transform anti-racism as the real racism. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1294.26s)]
*  And that's precisely what Jim Crow segregationists did. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1303.26s)]
*  You had enslavers casting abolitionists as the problem. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1307.26s)]
*  And unfortunately, that's still the case today. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1311.26s)]
*  Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, professor and founding director of the Center for Anti-Racist Research at Boston University. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1314.26s)]
*  Appreciate your time tonight, sir. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1320.26s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1322.26s)]
*  In one sense, this is a crime scene. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1324.26s)]
*  Just after 1230 a.m. on Sunday, gunfire erupted at a neighborhood in South Baltimore, Maryland called Brooklyn. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1327.26s)]
*  Thirty people were shot. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1334.26s)]
*  Many of them were critically injured. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1335.26s)]
*  Two of them died, including a young woman who had recently graduated from college. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1337.26s)]
*  In another sense, this is the scene of a public health crisis and a failure of political will to do anything about the guns that are killing so many people. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1340.26s)]
*  The mayor of Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott, is going to join us live in just a moment. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1349.26s)]
*  But first, I want you to hear his words for his own city of Baltimore today. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1354.26s)]
*  This is not just a Baltimore thing. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1359.26s)]
*  We have to be honest. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1362.26s)]
*  This is the United States of America. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1364.26s)]
*  This is our longest standing public health challenge. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1366.26s)]
*  And we need to focus on gun violence, regardless of where it happens, right? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1369.26s)]
*  Whether it's in inner city Baltimore, whether it's in suburbia, whether it's in rural America, we have to take this conversation beyond not just me, but all my brother and sister mayors around the country who we have these conversations consistently. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1374.26s)]
*  It's like we take turns telling each other that we're here to support each other. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1387.26s)]
*  And we know that we're going through. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1391.26s)]
*  But you're talking about a country where it's easier for a 14-year-old kid to order pieces together to put a gun together and go out and use it in committance of a crime than it is for me to get Clariden D from CVS. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1396.26s)]
*  That's what we should be talking about every day in this country. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1411.26s)]
*  You hear folks say, well, oh, the violence is happening in Democrat-led cities. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1414.26s)]
*  Well, the guns are coming from Republican-led states, right? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1418.26s)]
*  But who cares? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1420.26s)]
*  People are dying in Baltimore, in the United States, and that's what should matter. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1421.26s)]
*  And that's what we should be acting on every day. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1426.26s)]
*  Joining us now is Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1428.26s)]
*  Mayor, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1432.26s)]
*  We appreciate you making the time. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1435.26s)]
*  What is the latest update you can share with us at this hour? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1437.26s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for having me, Simone. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1440.26s)]
*  What we're still doing, of course, right now, our detectives are working, going through all the hours. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1444.26s)]
*  All the hours of footage, we're going to look at every second of footage, not just from CCTV, from social media, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1449.26s)]
*  going out talking to as many witnesses as possible. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1455.26s)]
*  When we have, in this case, so many young people, 15 of our victims were under the age of 18 in Maryland. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1459.26s)]
*  They cannot be talked to by police without their parent permission or a lawyer present. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1466.26s)]
*  So that elongates that process. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1471.26s)]
*  And we've also, again, put the full weight of my city government in Brooklyn. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1473.26s)]
*  I just came from a community meeting when we were talking about how we, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1478.26s)]
*  as our neighborhood stabilization response done from our mayor's office of neighborhood safety engagement, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1482.26s)]
*  will be there for 45 days. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1487.26s)]
*  But what we can do working with that community from here on out to make sure that we're wrapping our arms in every single resource that's coming to bear. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1489.26s)]
*  I had the unfortunate tonight having to talk with Aliya's parents and Aliya's parents tonight to talk to both parents who lost children, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1496.26s)]
*  one who just graduated from high school and was supposed to be starting college, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1506.26s)]
*  another who his mom was crying literally right in front of me as I tried to console her because her son used to tutor young people in high school. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1510.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1519.26s)]
*  This is what we're talking about dealing with, this mass shooting that happened in our city that was an act carried out. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1520.26s)]
*  And we know that this is going to be illegal guns when we get to the end of it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1526.26s)]
*  More than 200 people are said to have attended the block party, Mayor. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1531.26s)]
*  How come you don't yet have a suspect identified? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1536.26s)]
*  Well, listen, because this is still fresh. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1540.26s)]
*  Again, when you have a lot of the victims themselves, we still have seven of them in the hospital, right? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1544.26s)]
*  And we have to get permission to talk to those young people. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1550.26s)]
*  That's a process that we're going to have to go through, going through that footage, looking to see who was out there, who had weapons. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1553.26s)]
*  I want to be very clear. We are going to find these people. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1559.26s)]
*  We're going to hold the people that pulled that gun that trigger responsible, Simone, but we're not going to stop there. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1563.26s)]
*  We're going to look at where that gun came from, whether it's traffic into Baltimore, who sold it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1569.26s)]
*  We're going to look at manufacturers, at dealers, everyone that plays a part. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1574.26s)]
*  And what happened in this tragedy will be held accountable in every way possible. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1578.26s)]
*  Police think there were at least three guns involved in this mass shooting. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1584.26s)]
*  Do you yet know whether the guns were legal? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1590.26s)]
*  And I know that this has been a huge issue for you. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1593.26s)]
*  Ghost guns, getting them out of circulation. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1596.26s)]
*  That is what you were alluding to in your remarks in the press conference, where you talked about a 14-year-old being able to order pieces to put a gun together. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1599.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think, Simone, we don't know yet. We know that there are multiple weapons. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1609.26s)]
*  We're going to be going back through, working with our partners at ATF and making sure that we're seeing exactly how many weapons were used. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1614.26s)]
*  Were they used in the commitments of other crimes, which we always get those hits and see that these weapons are used in crimes not just here in Baltimore, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1621.26s)]
*  but we get guns that were used in crimes in other cities and other states that end up here as well. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1629.26s)]
*  We do know that ghost guns are a big problem, not just here in Baltimore, but across this country. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1634.26s)]
*  Maryland itself, we banned ghost guns. And guess what? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1639.26s)]
*  We banned ghost guns a few years ago and ghost gun recoveries are down for us here in Baltimore this year. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1642.26s)]
*  But we still know that guns here tend to come from other states. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1647.26s)]
*  We recover more weapons, Simone, that come from other states every year than here in Maryland because of Maryland's gun laws. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1651.26s)]
*  And we have to have that conversation. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1659.26s)]
*  There should not be. And you're talking to someone who's the grandson of a pig farmer from North Carolina. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1661.26s)]
*  I first learned how to shoot my granddaddy's shotgun when I was 10 years old. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1668.26s)]
*  If folks are owning guns the right way, that's their prerogative. That's their American right. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1673.26s)]
*  But we're talking about 14, 15-year-olds, people that are prohibited from having guns, being able to go on a website, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1678.26s)]
*  order pieces of a gun together and put it together. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1685.26s)]
*  And the company knowingly is doing that because they are knowingly going around gun laws. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1688.26s)]
*  And those weapons are being used in cities and towns and areas across this country every day. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1694.26s)]
*  Congress should ban them right now. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1700.26s)]
*  That shouldn't even be a discussion with the amount of mass shootings that we had this year, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1703.26s)]
*  let alone since the first one that everyone talked about in Columbine High School way back in 1999. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1707.26s)]
*  We need the Congress to get off their butts and get involved in this fight. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1713.26s)]
*  And it's not just ghost guns. It's how guns are trafficked and illegal guns keep ending up in the hands of people [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1718.26s)]
*  who are pulling triggers and killing people in malls, in churches, at block parties, on streets each and every day. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1725.26s)]
*  This is America's longest-standing public health challenge. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1733.26s)]
*  And we as a country have not dealt with this issue in its entirety in this time that we actually do it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1737.26s)]
*  Not Band-Aids. We have a president who's done so much for this. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1743.26s)]
*  We have congressional members who've been fighting for this. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1747.26s)]
*  But we have so many members sitting in Congress who still weigh American guns over American lives, and that's despicable. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1750.26s)]
*  Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, on a very busy day for you, sir. We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1758.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1765.26s)]
*  I am here because Harlem, you believed in me. Harlem has spoken. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1767.26s)]
*  I've often said on the campaign trail, I am not a seasoned politician. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1776.26s)]
*  So therefore, this was not politics as usual. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1784.26s)]
*  I got the opportunity to include in my campaign the voice of the people. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1790.26s)]
*  The fact that people had hope in a person whose experience has lasted 34 years, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1796.26s)]
*  because that's how long I was fighting for freedom, justice, and equality. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1806.26s)]
*  That was Youssef Salam, who you might remember as a member of the Central Park Five, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1811.26s)]
*  a group of black and Latino teens who were wrongfully arrested, convicted, and incarcerated for the rape and assault of a woman in Central Park in 1989. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1817.26s)]
*  Donald Trump famously took out newspaper ads at the time and called for the death penalty for the Five. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1826.26s)]
*  Well, today they are known as the Exonerated Five after DNA evidence proves someone else committed the crime. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1832.26s)]
*  And Youssef Salam is now the frontrunner in the Democratic primary race for Harlem's 9th City Council District. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1838.26s)]
*  A winner has not been officially declared, but Salam won twice the number of votes as his nearest competitor, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1845.26s)]
*  a sitting assemblywoman who's been a fixture in local New York City politics and previously held that very council seat. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1851.26s)]
*  So there is a strong likelihood that he will not only win the primary, but also win the heavily Democratic 9th District seat in November. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1857.26s)]
*  As Youssef Salam points out, he might be a political outsider, but he's no stranger to being in the public eye. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1865.26s)]
*  Salam was, he's poised to win an election for a public office as part of a new generation of politicians, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1872.26s)]
*  once operating adjacent to the political party apparatus, and now have decided to get involved. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1879.26s)]
*  That is a power shift and it's getting the attention of leaders in the community he hopes to serve. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1885.26s)]
*  Here's what Michael A. Wollron Jr., a pastor at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1890.26s)]
*  told the New York Times about Salam's nearest competitor. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1896.26s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1900.26s)]
*  Well, joining us now is Youssef Salam, the candidate for New York City's 9th District seat. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1916.26s)]
*  He's also, as I said, one of the exonerated five. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1922.26s)]
*  It is good to see you, sir. Thank you for making some time this evening for us. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1925.26s)]
*  Let's start with talking about this election in this primary, because you won twice as many votes as your closest competitor. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1930.26s)]
*  Inez Dickens formerly held that seat for at least 10 years. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1937.26s)]
*  Why do you think that voters resonated with you in this way, that they came out to support you so much? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1942.26s)]
*  You know, the thing about our beloved Harlem is that people have been pushed to the back. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1949.26s)]
*  They've been left out. They've been divested of. And I think the pain is so apparent. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1955.26s)]
*  There's been so many people that have been looking for hope. They've been wanting hope. They've been needing hope. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1960.26s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is that, you know, we have to occupy all spaces. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1965.26s)]
*  If we're not at the table, we're the ones that are on the menu and they are deciding for us what our lives are going to look like. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1969.26s)]
*  And, you know, when I think about my story, my struggles here, I was marching for 12 years after we were found innocent. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1977.26s)]
*  Me and my brothers were out there in the streets marching for justice. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1984.26s)]
*  There was no one in the halls of power to hear our voices. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1987.26s)]
*  And the fact that I now had the opportunity, I would say, to lead, to lead our people. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1990.26s)]
*  Leadership is service. And how best to serve them by being one of those who understands exactly where the pain is at, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=1998.26s)]
*  understands the voices of our people and says, you know what, I'm going to do something about it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2005.26s)]
*  I am going to carry your voices into the halls of power. I'm going to speak truth to power. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2010.26s)]
*  My word is going to be my bond. And this will not be politics as usual. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2015.26s)]
*  You know, a recent Fox News poll found that trust in our institutions are actually reaching record lows with faith in Congress down to 34 percent among registered voters. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2021.26s)]
*  We don't even need to talk about the Supreme Court. Do you think that your outsider status really worked in your favor given that growing sentiment? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2032.26s)]
*  Because people didn't view you as a part of the institution, they maybe trusted you more. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2040.26s)]
*  I think that really, really played a great part in the fact that here it is 34 years later. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2046.26s)]
*  This case was a case that really trampled upon black and brown bodies in our communities. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2052.26s)]
*  You know, the names Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Corey Wise, Antjuan McCray and Youssef Salaam are part of the fabric of what was considered wrong with America and now considered, wow, this is now case study. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2058.26s)]
*  We need to figure out how we can ensure, in fact, that people don't go to prison for crimes that they didn't commit. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2074.26s)]
*  And here it is. I could have been a private citizen. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2080.26s)]
*  But I think the beauty of my story is that I've come to use the same platform that I've had. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2083.26s)]
*  And I said, you know what? I'm going to help. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2089.26s)]
*  I am going to use it to effectuate the greatest change in my community because I know we can't change things in two years. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2092.26s)]
*  I know we can't change things in four years, but we can start a movement. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2099.26s)]
*  And that movement includes all of us, because just like my mother told me when I was 15, she said they need you to participate in whatever it is they're trying to do. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2103.26s)]
*  Do not participate, she said, refuse. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2112.26s)]
*  And so when I think about all of the ills that are invading our community, the fact that there's an effort trying to capture our minds, because this is a mental war that we are fighting against. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2114.26s)]
*  If they can get me to accept that I am inferior and that they are superior, then I lost. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2128.26s)]
*  Every single one of us was born on purpose. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2138.26s)]
*  And the beauty of coexisting is allowing for the greatest greatness that is inside of us to to ooze out because psychosocially, if I am re-embraced by society, guess what I do? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2140.26s)]
*  I give the very best of myself and society in turn gives the very best of themselves. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2153.26s)]
*  And so this is a movement into our future that will literally span the next 50 to 100 years or more. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2159.26s)]
*  And I'm telling us we have to begin to plan in 100 year cycles because that's what matters. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2167.26s)]
*  We got to be at the table. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2173.26s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir, but this point you're making about a movement, I find it very interesting because, you know, I used to advise a lot of candidates back in the day. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2175.26s)]
*  And I always found it that it was easier, if you will, to campaign than it was to govern. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2185.26s)]
*  And while the votes are still being counted, I think it's safe to say that your win in November is nearly a foregone conclusion. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2192.26s)]
*  And at that point, you will no longer be an outsider. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2197.26s)]
*  You will be a politician. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2201.26s)]
*  You will be a person on the inside. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2204.26s)]
*  And as you are talking about these issues, you've listed affordable housing in a number of the interviews and on the campaign trail, education funding, policing as some of the biggest issues affecting District 9 that you want to tackle. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2206.26s)]
*  And it seems to me you are laying the groundwork that that that is something that you won't get done in one year or two years. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2219.26s)]
*  Is it that you're building a coalition here? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2228.26s)]
*  You're trying to bring people along in the political process to understand how change actually takes place? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2230.26s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, on my platform, Harlem4Usep.com, I've laid it all out. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2236.26s)]
*  And what I'm really trying to get people to see is that people want a miracle. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2241.26s)]
*  And a miracle is happening right in front of our faces. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2246.26s)]
*  That's what resonates with people. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2250.26s)]
*  When they see me, they don't see just an individual who's saying, you know what, I want to run for office. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2252.26s)]
*  I think I'm going to make it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2258.26s)]
*  They see a person who was damaged by society, who was counted out, who then said, I'm going to bet on myself. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2259.26s)]
*  But more than that, what I represent for our people is the very hope that we all need, that it's possible. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2267.26s)]
*  Because if I could resuscitate my life through the grace of God, we most certainly can resuscitate our lives. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2275.26s)]
*  The problem is that we are the secret ingredient and we have a huge mountain to lift. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2282.26s)]
*  But we lift as we climb, as the young people told me so brilliantly. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2290.26s)]
*  We have to be about that. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2295.26s)]
*  Before I let you go, sir, I want to get your reaction to someone I think you're quite familiar with. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2297.26s)]
*  We're learning that Special Counsel Jack Smith is speaking to more people in Donald Trump's circle as he investigates his role in January 6. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2303.26s)]
*  That is, of course, just one of several investigations into Trump. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2310.26s)]
*  Can I just get your reaction to the legal issues that Donald Trump is facing? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2314.26s)]
*  You know, I've said it very succinctly, karma, because, you know, unfortunately, what has been played out in our communities, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2319.26s)]
*  we've got this idea that we are in a United States of America, but we as black people know that we are in the divided states of America. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2330.26s)]
*  It's always been separate and unequal. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2338.26s)]
*  And the truth of the matter is that even when I hold out hope, stating that I hope that he gets the opportunity to get the justice that eluded us, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2341.26s)]
*  I know that you're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2349.26s)]
*  But when they look at the color of our skin, they see guilty, guilty, guilty. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2352.26s)]
*  But when you have the complexion for so-called protection, you get every opportunity under the law to get the proper, the law to work for you. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2357.26s)]
*  And that's the challenge, us to be able to see it, us to see the juxtaposition, us to be able to understand what's really going on. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2368.26s)]
*  It is technology. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2375.26s)]
*  But at the same time, we have to know as good as the good people we are. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2377.26s)]
*  And I'm going to call us that we have never wanted revenge. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2382.26s)]
*  We have only wanted equality. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2386.26s)]
*  And we definitely need equity. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2388.26s)]
*  And so when I think about here we are on the cusp of seeing some miracle happen again and again and again, we are living in prophecy. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2391.26s)]
*  And we have to all take heed. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2401.26s)]
*  It's about what we do with our hands, what we do with our feet, because all of that stuff is going to come back to us. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2403.26s)]
*  And we have to be righteous actors in everything that we do. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2411.26s)]
*  Youssef, Salam, thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2415.26s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2419.26s)]
*  My absolute pleasure. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2420.26s)]
*  And thank you as well. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2421.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuG9WBJQ0&t=2449.26s)]
