# Trump turns White House into Tesla showroom as Musk gets ‘government bailout’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI)
*  Any chance you went by a Tesla dealership this weekend? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=0.0s)]
*  If so, you might have noticed something. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=3.16s)]
*  There is a growing protest movement around the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=5.66s)]
*  Demonstrators in all 50 states full of energy, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=8.68s)]
*  pointed signs, trying to hit billionaire, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=11.96s)]
*  unelected co-president Elon Musk where it hurts. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=14.72s)]
*  The value of his car company's stock. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=18.54s)]
*  Protest organizers and lots of just everyday individuals, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=21.56s)]
*  have also been designing and printing out [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=25.52s)]
*  to put on parked Tesla cars saying things like, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=28.56s)]
*  sorry about your swastika, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=31.8s)]
*  and the more direct, please sell your car. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=34.04s)]
*  It seems like a movement that's definitely gaining momentum. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=37.24s)]
*  There's online websites that are organizing these protests. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  They seem to be growing weekend to weekend. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=43.28s)]
*  On Monday, after a solid weekend of protests, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=45.8s)]
*  which was like the third or fourth in a row, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=48.14s)]
*  the markets opened and Tesla's stock tanked. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  Down more than 15% on the day, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  down more than 50% from its peak [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=56.28s)]
*  a few weeks after the election. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=58.6s)]
*  Now, all other things being equal, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  Tesla stock was due for correction. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=62.92s)]
*  Hugely, hugely overvalued. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=64.72s)]
*  And that was before its post-election day spike, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=66.56s)]
*  when people snapped up Tesla stock because well, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=70.04s)]
*  Elon Musk was gonna be running policy in the White House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=72.72s)]
*  And of course, that's gonna be good for Tesla. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Now the stock has come back down to earth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's really clearly starting to get [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=80.64s)]
*  under Elon Musk's skin. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=83.0s)]
*  On Saturday, he claimed without evidence on accident, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=85.5s)]
*  investigation of some kind had revealed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=87.9s)]
*  that wealthy philanthropists, including George Soros, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=89.92s)]
*  were funding the groups behind Tesla protests. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=92.66s)]
*  And so today, Donald Trump offered Musk [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=95.92s)]
*  a government bailout of sorts. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=99.16s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you buying a Tesla [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  will boost Tesla sales and boost the stock? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=105.14s)]
*  Look, look. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=107.58s)]
*  Was that your goal by doing this? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  I care about one thing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=110.3s)]
*  When somebody's a great patriot, they shouldn't be hurt. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=111.5s)]
*  He's a great patriot. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=115.22s)]
*  Yeah, Donald Trump bought a car from his buddy, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  or at least he said he did, who knows, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=119.52s)]
*  Right off the makeshift Tesla lot, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=121.66s)]
*  they set up in front of the White House. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=123.66s)]
*  What does this have to do with the American people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=125.42s)]
*  and their interests, public interests? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=127.06s)]
*  Couldn't tell you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=128.9s)]
*  When Trump was asked what to do about the people [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=130.1s)]
*  targeting Tesla cars and dealerships, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=131.94s)]
*  here's what happened. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=133.66s)]
*  Some say they should be labeled domestic terrorists. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=135.9s)]
*  I will do that, I'll do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=138.74s)]
*  I'm gonna stop them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=140.14s)]
*  We catch anybody doing it because they're harming [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=141.26s)]
*  a great American company. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=144.18s)]
*  You're either with the Tesla or you're with the terrorists? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=146.5s)]
*  That's one way to try to stabilize [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=149.94s)]
*  an oligarch's business empire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=151.5s)]
*  The thing to understand is just how actually precarious [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=153.66s)]
*  the entire Tesla empire is. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=156.18s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=157.5s)]
*  One way to measure a stock's value is to compare its price [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  to how much money the company actually earns. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=162.18s)]
*  The higher the price to earnings ratio, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=165.02s)]
*  the more expensive, unrealistic a stock's price [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=167.34s)]
*  would seem to be. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=171.12s)]
*  So, for instance, car makers like VW and GM [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=172.26s)]
*  have a price to earnings ratio of around four. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=175.74s)]
*  But according to recent data, Tesla's P.E. ratio [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=179.66s)]
*  is currently about 87, more than 20 times higher [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=183.06s)]
*  than GM's price to earnings ratio. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=187.74s)]
*  You see the rest of the cars there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=189.22s)]
*  Tesla is still one of the most overvalued stocks [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=190.78s)]
*  on the whole market in terms of price to earnings. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=193.74s)]
*  And it's because many people think Elon Musk [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=196.66s)]
*  is a unique genius. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=198.82s)]
*  If he says they're gonna win, they're gonna win. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=200.02s)]
*  But now investors seem to be not so sure. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=202.74s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=206.02s)]
*  Tesla's customer base up until now has been [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=206.86s)]
*  the kinds of people that live in blue metro areas [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  and are generally pretty liberal [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=212.56s)]
*  and generally hate Donald Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  And now they hate Elon Musk. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=216.18s)]
*  It's why his European car sales [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=218.58s)]
*  have just fallen off the map. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=220.5s)]
*  And other nations and companies [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=222.74s)]
*  now have really good electric cars. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  There's tons of competition, lots of options for consumers [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=225.86s)]
*  who don't like this dude. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=229.06s)]
*  And there's kind of a lesson here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  It's why you don't usually see CEOs running around, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=232.82s)]
*  publicly spewing insane right-wing conspiracy theories, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=236.14s)]
*  insulting foreign ministers, and doing salutes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=238.82s)]
*  that look for all the world like Sig-Hales twice. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=241.5s)]
*  It's not great business. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  Musk thinks he's somehow past all that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=246.82s)]
*  But the anger and the protests are growing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=249.26s)]
*  And gold-plated chainsaws and dark MAGA hats [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=251.62s)]
*  may not be the moves of a business genius after all. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=254.17999999999998s)]
*  And so, we're gonna have to wait and see. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRy6kNmy_QI&t=259.02000000000004s)]
