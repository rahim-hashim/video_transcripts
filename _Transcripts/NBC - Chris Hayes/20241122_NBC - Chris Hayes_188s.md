# ‘Disgusting’: AOC eviscerates Republican rep's trans bathroom stunt
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA)
*  Talking here, the Democrats are too focused on identity politics, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=0.0s)]
*  while Republicans won by being focused on kitchen table issues. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=3.04s)]
*  We have this current ongoing example that shows the opposite. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=6.96s)]
*  So Sarah McBride will be the first out transgender woman ever to serve in Congress. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=10.88s)]
*  We had her here on this show days after she won. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  She talked about how she ran and won in Delaware on like kitchen table issues, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=18.56s)]
*  meat and potato stuff, and has come to Congress to work on those issues. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=22.88s)]
*  And in response to this, a Republican congresswoman from South Carolina named [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=26.8s)]
*  Nancy Mace has decided to basically devote herself full time to bullying, harassing, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=30.48s)]
*  and abusing her new colleague in her new workplace by obsessing over her body and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=34.56s)]
*  trying to kick her out of bathrooms. Republican speaker Mike Johnson is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=38.72s)]
*  shamefully going along with it. Now McBride is basically trying to stay out of it saying, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=42.0s)]
*  I'm not here to fight about bathrooms, I'm here to fight for the folks in my state, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=45.92s)]
*  and to bring down costs facing families. And I will say for me, it's been kind of a dilemma [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  to cover this because you really don't want to feed the desperately sad and weird trolls who are [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=53.92s)]
*  so, so thirsty for attention to make a name for themselves for cruelty. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=61.2s)]
*  But I thought Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York had the perfect [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=65.6s)]
*  response to the whole thing. And so I just, I'm going to play it for you in full. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=69.52s)]
*  I want to be very clear about this. When it comes to who has the right to access a bathroom here, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=75.44s)]
*  Nancy Mace and what speaker Johnson are doing are endangering all women and girls. Because if you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=84.0s)]
*  ask them, what is your plan on how to enforce this, they won't come up with an answer. And what it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=90.56s)]
*  inevitably results in are women and girls who are primed for assault because they want, because [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=96.8s)]
*  people are going to want to check their private parts in suspecting who is trans and who is cis [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=103.04s)]
*  and who's doing what. And so the idea that Nancy Mace wants little girls and women to drop [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  trow in front of who? An investigator? Who would that be in order because she wants to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=114.8s)]
*  suspect and point fingers at who she thinks is trans is disgusting. It is disgusting. And frankly, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=120.16s)]
*  all it does is allow these Republicans to go around and bully any woman who isn't wearing a skirt [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=126.24s)]
*  because they think she might not look woman enough. People have a right to express themselves, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=132.24s)]
*  to dress how they want and to be who they are. And if a woman doesn't look woman enough to a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=137.68s)]
*  Republican, they want to be able to inspect her genitals to use a bathroom? It's disgusting. And [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=142.4s)]
*  everybody, no matter how you feel on this issue, should reject it completely. What are they doing? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=148.16s)]
*  They're doing this so that Nancy Mace can make a buck and send a text and fundraise off an email. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=153.84s)]
*  They're not doing this to protect people. They're endangering women. They're endangering girls [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=158.88s)]
*  of all kinds. And everybody should reject it. It's gross. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuNQiBs8KGA&t=163.04000000000002s)]
