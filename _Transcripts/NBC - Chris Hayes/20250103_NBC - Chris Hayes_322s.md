# Democrats can ‘exploit’ growing fractures in MAGA Congress, says Rep. Raskin
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM)
*  Congressman Jimmy Raskin, who does know a thing or two about how messy it is as a Democrat in Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=0.0s)]
*  He was elected ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=3.92s)]
*  On the scale of possible drama, today was lower than it could have been. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=8.76s)]
*  We could have had the first day of the last Congress with what was it, 12 votes to get to McCarthy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=12.84s)]
*  What was your takeaway from today? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=17.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, I was sitting with a bunch of my colleagues, and I was with Jim Himes and Summer Lee and Richie Neal, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=20.6s)]
*  and some people were predicting this was going to go on for a week like it did last time, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=26.96s)]
*  and that undoubtedly is in the character of the ultra-mega, ultra-Trump faction, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=31.84s)]
*  as opposed to just the Trump subservient faction. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=38.4s)]
*  But then others said, you know what, they're going to call Donald Trump, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  and they're going to get him on the phone, and he's going to talk to those people and tell them whatever they need to hear, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  and they'll convince Trump to damp down the chaos just on the theory that he needs to have the troops in order for Monday when he gets elected. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=49.36s)]
*  And sure enough, that's exactly what happened. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=60.4s)]
*  My read of the sort of main axis of division here is on this question of government spending cuts. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=63.08s)]
*  And basically, here's my read, and I want to hear what you think of it, which is most Republicans don't actually care about spending. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=71.2s)]
*  It's sort of a useful rhetorical tool, but actually it's not, it's who the government benefits, not how big it is, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  They like defense spending. They like all sorts of spending. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=82.84s)]
*  There are some hardcore members who have genuine ideological commitments on the score, Chip Roy, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=85.12s)]
*  And they're easy to roll because Donald Trump doesn't care. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=91.08s)]
*  But this weird new question mark of Elon Musk suddenly gives that faction a level of heft and influence [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=94.64s)]
*  that seems to me like an unavoidable fight is going to have to happen on this question. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=102.2s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=106.96s)]
*  Well, I think that's absolutely right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  And it's gotten worse for them because the 220 to 215 margin just went down to 219 to 215. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=110.08s)]
*  And then Elise Stefanik is going to go and Mike Walz is going to go. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  So you're talking about a situation where they cannot afford to lose even Chip Roy's vote. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=122.32s)]
*  And he probably speaks for about a half a dozen members, maybe maybe up to a dozen members, including Massey. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=127.56s)]
*  And these are people who are treating Donald Trump like a complete lame duck. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=135.88s)]
*  They know that he doesn't really pay attention to public policy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=139.6s)]
*  It's just a money making operation for him and his family. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=142.6s)]
*  And so they're already looking to these conflicts beyond Donald Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=145.56s)]
*  And they don't mind the idea of just in a legislative sense, blowing the whole thing up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=150.16s)]
*  And that's why they've, you know, tried to reserve as much as possible this motion to vacate the chair. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=156.44s)]
*  They've designed it, by the way, in a completely unconstitutional way, saying that the majority, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=162.76s)]
*  the Republicans, can bring a motion to vacate when the majority, the minority cannot do that, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=167.92s)]
*  which is the first time to my knowledge that the rules of the House of Representatives encode [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=174.44s)]
*  partisan discrimination into how we proceed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=179.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=182.84s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=183.52s)]
*  The old for as long as you've been serving, the motion vacate is just a thing available to members, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=184.24s)]
*  not to the majority of the minority. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=189.52s)]
*  And now they have encoded the power only for the majority into this new House rules package [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=191.4s)]
*  for the first time, as you understand it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=197.4s)]
*  Yes, indeed. I think it's seven members. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=200.12s)]
*  It may be nine, but I think it's nine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  You need seven members or nine members from the majority and not the minority. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=203.76s)]
*  And I just find no precedent for doing that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  It would be like saying only, you know, Republicans can move to adjourn or move to recommit or move to reconsider. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=212.52s)]
*  It just makes no sense. It's the opposite of what a rule is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=219.6s)]
*  But, you know, it's going to be a madcap ride with these people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  I do think that we're going to be able to exploit these growing contradictions within the mega coalition, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=228.76s)]
*  especially since Donald Trump cares less and less. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=235.28s)]
*  So you've got, you know, the inflamed nativist anti-immigration mega base versus the billionaire [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=238.24s)]
*  oligarchs like Elon Musk, who love cheap foreign labor and say, you know, let's open the doors and bring everybody in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=248.0s)]
*  You've got people like Mike Johnson, the theocratic anti-choice right, who call abortion murder and have pushed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=254.84s)]
*  for federal legislation banning abortion like Johnson's Life Begins at Conception Act versus those libertarian [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=263.12s)]
*  corporate CEOs whose employees are freaking out about all the anti-abortion laws that exist in half of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=271.56s)]
*  country. So you can see already things beginning to come apart at the seams for them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=277.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I don't underestimate them because they did win the election and they do have the majority. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=283.2s)]
*  So that, you know, that's key. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=287.64s)]
*  But the key thing here to me tactically is whether Democrats stay unified, because if they do and they negotiate [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=289.4s)]
*  through Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrats will have a ton of leverage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=295.24s)]
*  That's the big if, Congressman Jamie Raskin. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=298.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT__gwZ08cM&t=300.96s)]
