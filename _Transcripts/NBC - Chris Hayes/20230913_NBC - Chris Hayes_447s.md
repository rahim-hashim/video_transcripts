Video Description: Former Manhattan DA Cy Vance on the Trump case brought by Fulton County DA Fani Willis: “The RICO statue that she’s used is powerful and she’s using it, I believe, to good effect. The consequences of using that strategy is it’s more complicated to manage the logistics.”

# Ex-Manhattan DA: Georgia DA using RICO statue ‘to good effect’ in Trump case
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0)
*  Donald Trump's multiplying legal teams have been busy with a flurry of motions over the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=0.0s)]
*  past few days, court action. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=3.96s)]
*  In Washington, D.C., his lawyers filed to have the judge, Tanya Chutkin, in the election [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=5.96s)]
*  stealing case recuse herself. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=9.86s)]
*  In New York, more of his legal team told an appeals court that his defamation trial set [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=11.4s)]
*  for January should be put on hold so he can argue presidential immunity. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=16.68s)]
*  That trial, keep in mind, is only about how much he owes writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=22.44s)]
*  her since the jury already found him liable for defamation and sexual abuse. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=26.76s)]
*  In Georgia, the ex-president's lawyers are asking the judge to toss out eight of the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=32.4s)]
*  13 counts brought against him by Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=36.6s)]
*  Cyrus Vance Jr. serves as the Manhattan District Attorney for more than a decade, from 2010 [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=41.56s)]
*  till 2022. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=45.56s)]
*  During that time, his office began the long investigation into Donald Trump's hush money [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=46.56s)]
*  case, the first case in which the ex-president ultimately was indicted. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=50.64s)]
*  And Cy Vance joins me now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=53.8s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=54.8s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  You know, the position of Manhattan District Attorney is probably one of the, you know, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  certainly at the state level, probably one of the most high profile prosecutors in the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=60.44s)]
*  country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=64.08s)]
*  I think it would be fair to say. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=65.08s)]
*  You know, you've got a whole law and order show about you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=66.08s)]
*  And it's natural that you have a lot of eyes on you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  You have very, very high profile cases. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  And I just wonder, like, if you're running a prosecution office and you've got a high [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=76.24s)]
*  profile case and you've got a very powerful and well-lawyered defendant, how that changes [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=80.2s)]
*  the atmosphere under which you prosecute the case? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=86.92s)]
*  Well, I think it's the Manhattan DA's office is no stranger to high profile cases, whether [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=90.84s)]
*  it's in politics or sexual abuse or in typical street crime. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=96.64s)]
*  So I think that actually the focus when a case is under media scrutiny is to keep your [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=101.76s)]
*  team focused on their job. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=109.24s)]
*  And that is the witnesses, the evidence and your job as DA is really to protect them from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=111.55999999999999s)]
*  the external. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  All that stuff. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  All that stuff and to get them focused. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  And as the DA, I think you are absorbing, as you do reading the papers and listening [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=120.96s)]
*  to the news, the advocates and the critics, you absorb all that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  But as the DA, I really do think you just need to keep your eye. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=132.04s)]
*  It's like a pro basketball player trying to shoot the free throw. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=137.4s)]
*  Focus on the shot. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=141.24s)]
*  All the rest is noise. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=144.6s)]
*  Totally. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=146.24s)]
*  There is, though, this sort of tactical question that's interesting. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=147.4s)]
*  So in the case of, you know, in this Georgia case, it's a very complicated case, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  It's very clear, Nick Ackerman was writing about this in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=156.46s)]
*  this sort of the 19 co-defendants are trying as much as they can to break up the case, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=164.36s)]
*  So the reigning defendants, including Trump, could get to preview the prosecution's case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=165.96s)]
*  They could drag out the trials. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  They could delay the other defendants from having to face the music, make it more likely [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  to force better plea deals for individual clients from a district attorney who does [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  not want to litigate the case multiple times. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=177.84s)]
*  In terms of how you deal with the tactical imperative here, particularly on speed and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  pace, how do you think about that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=185.12s)]
*  Well, the district attorney made a conscious decision to proceed with the 19 defendant [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=187.84s)]
*  case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=195.04s)]
*  She has experience with that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=196.44s)]
*  She's been successful with that, and she believes that is the best way to assign responsibility [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=197.84s)]
*  and that she can manage it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  The challenge, which she's no stranger to, is 19 defendants are a lot of defendants to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=206.2s)]
*  manage, but the X factor is obviously President Trump, the politics and the chaos, and this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=212.24s)]
*  is where he's a 500 hitter in the chaos world. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=217.56s)]
*  So I think the challenge she has is now she's going to have to manage all these motions [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=223.52s)]
*  for separate trials and the like, but at the end of the day, her team will manage that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=229.24s)]
*  They may not get all the rulings they like. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=235.16s)]
*  There may be a case that is set for trial early that may give other folks have access [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=236.88s)]
*  to discovery. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=241.72s)]
*  But all that, I think, is a foreseeable and natural outcome of a decision to bring a multi-defendant [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=243.42s)]
*  case, and I assume that she believes that the evidence is strong, that it will survive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=249.14s)]
*  one or two, three trials, and she has every confidence that her team will prevail. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=256.06s)]
*  Have you had 19 defendants? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=261.62s)]
*  I've had 103 defendants in cases. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=263.14s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=265.97999999999996s)]
*  It's a lot, and was criticized for having 103 defendants in cases. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=267.38s)]
*  What was that case? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=271.7s)]
*  It was just a large gang case, a real northern Manhattan. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=272.97999999999996s)]
*  But a RICO case. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=277.82s)]
*  It must have been, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=278.82s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=279.82s)]
*  It was a straight conspiracy to commit murder case. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=280.82s)]
*  But in any event, the RICO statute that she's used is powerful, and she's using it, I believe, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=283.18s)]
*  to good effect. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  The consequences of choosing that strategy is it's more complicated to manage the logistics, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=292.7s)]
*  and the judges have to make decisions in a 19-defendant case in terms of scheduling [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=297.7s)]
*  that they don't have to make in a 3-defendant case. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=303.58s)]
*  It also seems to me that this pace issue has to be, you know, you've seen this from Jack [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=306.02s)]
*  Smith's office, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=311.18s)]
*  Like, they never want to be, it's like when you're working on a project and other people [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=312.18s)]
*  are, you want to get it done and other people are lagging behind, you never want to be the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  obstacle, right? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=318.98s)]
*  Like, you never want to be the one who's got an outstanding email or a call returned or [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=319.98s)]
*  an item, but you always want to be like, I'm done, where are you? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=323.26s)]
*  I'm done, where are you? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=326.18s)]
*  And you can see that with Jack Smith, and I've got to imagine it does create pressure [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=327.34s)]
*  on everyone who's prosecuting all these cases if you are trying to make sure this thing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=330.14s)]
*  actually has a speedy trial before November of next year. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=334.52s)]
*  Well, I think if I'm reading tea leaves, the federal cases have the gravity and the weight [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=337.38s)]
*  to go first. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=345.17999999999995s)]
*  The Manhattan DA and even Judge Mershon in comments has indicated that they are not opposed [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=347.17999999999995s)]
*  necessarily to delay. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=353.58s)]
*  I don't think District Attorney Willis has said anything that I know of, but at the end [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=355.74s)]
*  of the day, when you have four cases and you have four prosecutors, there has to be order [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=360.66s)]
*  and there has to be comedy and also the defense position has to be taken into consideration. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  So it would not surprise me if the federal case goes first as is expected. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=372.1s)]
*  Yeah, this was today, Judge Mershon saying, in light of the many recent developments involving [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=376.22s)]
*  Mr. Trump and his rapidly evolving trial schedule, which I thought was sort of cheeky. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=382.42s)]
*  I do not believe it would be fruitful for us to conference this case on September 15th [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=387.54s)]
*  to discuss scheduling. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=392.22s)]
*  He wrote that to Trump lawyer Todd Blanch. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=393.86s)]
*  We will have a much better sense at that time whether there are any actual conflicts, if [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  so, what the best adjourned date might be for trial. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=399.18s)]
*  In other words, everyone's reading the newspaper, everyone understands this thing on March 4th. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  They're supposed to go later that month. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=405.82s)]
*  Judge Mershon and District Attorney Alvin Bragg have both expressed flexibility. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  As they should, by the way. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think that's entirely appropriate and it's not lessening the significance of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=413.54s)]
*  their case. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=418.26000000000005s)]
*  It's just we have a lot of... [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=419.26000000000005s)]
*  The guy's got to be there every day. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=422.86s)]
*  There's only one of them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  We've got to figure out how to manage this process. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opHgKqFgHw0&t=425.46000000000004s)]
