# With limited options, negotiations continue over hostages held by Hamas
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8)
*  Chris O'Leary is the former director of U.S. Hostage Rescue, and he joins me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=0.0s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=5.12s)]
*  Good to be here, Chris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=6.12s)]
*  So just take me through, just at a ground level, because this, you know, you've got [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=7.44s)]
*  the Israeli government saying Hamas is equivalent to ISIS and the Nazis, and reeling from this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=12.88s)]
*  brutal murder of its citizens. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=19.56s)]
*  They have 240 Israelis and other nationals, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=21.68s)]
*  The head of Mossad is in Doha, and he's going to negotiate with them? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  Like how does that work? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=32.16s)]
*  Well, they have to do it because they have limited options otherwise. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=34.12s)]
*  Although they did have a successful rescue as part of their ground operation, I think [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  as we get the full story on that, it was probably not one of the hostages held by Hamas, but [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=44.28s)]
*  more likely either Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which I still don't think that would have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=51.76s)]
*  been the case, but maybe one of the disparate affiliates, Hamas, has been trying to seize [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=55.72s)]
*  control of all of the hostages. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=61.32s)]
*  So as the ground operation was going, there are opportunities to maybe get some of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  folks that are more accessible. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=69.92s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=71.72s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=72.72s)]
*  So, but that's not to say that they won't continue to try to collect intelligence, illuminate [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=73.72s)]
*  the network and try to find where the hostages are and seek opportunities to recover. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=78.76s)]
*  At the end of the day, the special operations and intelligence forces that do hostage rescue [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  and recovery are the top tier. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=89.4s)]
*  They're problem solvers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  They're not wishing for an environment that is ideal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=93.68s)]
*  They're working within the confines of what they've been given, and they will try to find [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  solutions. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=101.44s)]
*  And I have every confidence that they will continue to work at this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=102.44s)]
*  But what the mature approach is, is to also try to negotiate at the same time, understanding [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=107.12s)]
*  that you don't have a legitimate partner in the negotiations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=111.36s)]
*  It's Hamas. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  They're a terrorist organization. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad is a terrorist organization, which many people don't know was born out [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, where Amin Zawahiri was one of the founding members of. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=122.48s)]
*  So understand who we're dealing with. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=128.72s)]
*  These are Islamists who just carried out, on October 7th, a horrific attack. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  They are not rational actors in this negotiation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=135.56s)]
*  They are taking very deliberate steps to be manipulative. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=139.36s)]
*  Each and every measure that they make, releasing the video of the hostages yesterday for propaganda, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=142.82s)]
*  was to pull leverage back to their side. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=150.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=152.8s)]
*  I mean, also, it strikes me that you could be manipulative and rational, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=153.8s)]
*  I mean, there's some back and forth here where, for the negotiations even to exist, there's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=157.0s)]
*  some conception that the other side has some interest and you have some interest and you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=163.92s)]
*  can find some way that they're mutually recognizable such that people's lives are spared, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=167.72s)]
*  I mean, that's basically the goal here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  But in terms of how they actually happen, the head of Mossad isn't sitting down with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  someone from Hamas, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=179.06s)]
*  I would find that very unlikely, although there have been times in the past where Israeli [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=181.1s)]
*  intelligence has been face to face with members of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=185.61999999999998s)]
*  So it wouldn't be out of the question. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=192.12s)]
*  I would say it's most likely that they're going to use the Qataris as the intermediary. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=194.76s)]
*  I have been involved in talks in Doha where all parties have sat around the table, but [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=199.66s)]
*  with the current situation, the current sensitivity, I think it would be unusual where we would [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=206.36s)]
*  see the actual head of the Mossad across the table with Abu Abed or somebody else. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=210.08s)]
*  As someone who's done this kind of work, I mean, what kind of, I guess, such a subjective [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=216.16s)]
*  question, but I want to ask it because I think it's so brutal to think about those folks [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=220.56s)]
*  being held captive. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=224.96s)]
*  Like, what hope do you have for more hostages being released? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=225.96s)]
*  I think it's very likely. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  I think it's going to be done over time. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  Hamas is not going to just open up the gates and let everybody free. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=233.4s)]
*  Hamas will likely, as being reported, release some of the international victims, but not [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=237.44s)]
*  all of them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  Anybody who's a dual passport holder from certain countries, my assessment would be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=246.4s)]
*  they'd hold on to them because, again, it gives them leverage, their ability to manipulate [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=250.6s)]
*  the environment later for longer. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=255.28s)]
*  But I do think that to get some international, more international support and some of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=259.48s)]
*  leverage back on their side, they will release some. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=264.84s)]
*  But this is going to drag out over time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=268.44s)]
*  Israeli military members in uniform could be held for years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=271.76000000000005s)]
*  Gilad Shalit, of course, the IDF soldier who was taken by Hamas and held for many years [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=275.88s)]
*  before his release and that prisoner swap back in 2011. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_XfCMDGL8&t=280.68s)]
