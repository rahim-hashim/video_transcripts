# Biden trolls Trump over Foxconn 'con job' He 'didn't build a damn thing'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE)
*  Today, President Joe Biden was in Racine, Wisconsin, announcing a $3.3 billion investment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=0.0s)]
*  by Microsoft to build a new artificial intelligence data center. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=7.2s)]
*  The project is expected to create 2,300 construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs in a state that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=10.84s)]
*  has been hit hard by the decline over the last several decades in U.S. manufacturing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=16.86s)]
*  But there's a particular reason why Biden made the trip to Wisconsin today to highlight [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=21.2s)]
*  this particular investment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=26.52s)]
*  The location of the new Microsoft project has special significance. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=29.12s)]
*  To understand that story, got to go back briefly to 2016. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=33.04s)]
*  Of course, that election was a big shock for a lot of the country, and not just because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=35.88s)]
*  Donald Trump won the Electoral College and thus the presidency, but because of the way [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=40.24s)]
*  he won, flipping former Democratic voters in states Democrats and carry it like Wisconsin. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=44.24s)]
*  The idea was that to many voters in the industrial Midwest, Donald Trump, among other things, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=51.16s)]
*  sold himself successfully as a kind of middle finger to the neoliberal free trade agenda [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=55.64s)]
*  of the last few decades, an agenda that really did gut industry and manufacturing jobs across [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=61.24s)]
*  the region that Trump was able to flip. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=66.8s)]
*  As we now know, of course, Donald Trump was all talk and no results. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=69.8s)]
*  I mean, that was clear back then, too. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=73.16s)]
*  His vow to bring about a manufacturing renaissance in the United States was a transparent con. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=75.8s)]
*  His empty promises to invest in new infrastructure became a running joke. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=81.92s)]
*  He imposed a slew of new tariffs that cost Americans more than $200 billion to date. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=86.8s)]
*  By the time Trump left office, there were over 154,000 fewer people employed in manufacturing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=93.16s)]
*  than when he was inaugurated. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=99.56s)]
*  In fact, one of the first moves after his election, when he announced that he had saved [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=101.88s)]
*  800 jobs at an Indianapolis carrier plant that were set to move to Mexico, that turned [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=107.44s)]
*  out to be a total flop as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=112.08s)]
*  Over 600 other jobs at the plant ended up being eliminated, along with 700 more at a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=114.48s)]
*  second Indiana plant. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=119.48s)]
*  But that was, of course, the signature Trump move, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=121.64s)]
*  A big glitzy announcement that turns into nothing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=124.12s)]
*  Perhaps the most egregious example on this crowded field of this came in 2018 when then [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=128.0s)]
*  President Trump wielded a literal golden shovel for the groundbreaking of what was supposed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=132.52s)]
*  to be a $10 billion project in Racine, Wisconsin. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump claimed to have negotiated a deal with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that manufactures [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=141.96s)]
*  iPhones, among other things, that would bring 13,000 jobs to the state. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=146.04s)]
*  We're restoring America's industrial might. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=151.68s)]
*  And thanks to the hardworking patriots like you, we're making America greater than ever [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=155.28s)]
*  before. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=161.16s)]
*  To Foxconn and to Terry Goh and to all of the amazing Wisconsin workers with us today [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=163.16s)]
*  and all over the state, I want to wish you good luck and congratulations on truly one [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=170.88s)]
*  of the eighth wonder. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=179.6s)]
*  I think we can say this is, we can say, the eighth wonder of the world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=182.2s)]
*  This is the eighth wonder of the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=185.76s)]
*  Can you say that really? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=189.04s)]
*  Well, it soon became clear this was all an outrageous, almost comically ludicrous boondoggle. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  As Josh Jezza reported for The Verge in a great bit of investigative reporting, the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=196.72s)]
*  project defaulted on almost every promise. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=201.88s)]
*  The factory, the tech campus, and the thousands of jobs simply never materialized. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  The building Foxconn calls a, quote, LCD factory, about one twentieth of the size of the original [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=209.64s)]
*  plan is little more than an empty shell. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=215.2s)]
*  Even the handful of jobs the company claims to have created are less than real, many of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=217.88s)]
*  them held by people with nothing to do, hired so the company could reach the number required [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=222.72s)]
*  for it to get tax subsidy payments from Wisconsin. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=227.56s)]
*  Many employees just sat in their cubicles watching Netflix and playing games on their [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=231.72s)]
*  phones. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=235.4s)]
*  The whole thing was a fiction. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=236.4s)]
*  But there was a real idea, you know, embedded somewhere deep in Donald Trump's rhetoric [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  of America first. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=244.6s)]
*  The idea of a rebellion against the specific version of outsourced, globalized capitalism [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=247.28s)]
*  that we had experienced that really did hit certain sectors of this country very, very [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=252.72s)]
*  hard. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=256.6s)]
*  And when Joe Biden came to office, he and his team began implementing economic policy [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=257.6s)]
*  that basically asked, what if we took all of that seriously? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=263.58s)]
*  What if we took seriously the concern that a whole lot of people in this country have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=268.36s)]
*  behind, that the era of outsourcing really did have incredibly damaging effects? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=273.38s)]
*  What if we tried to change that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  So he began with the Infrastructure Act, which has funded over 50,000 projects across all [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=281.78s)]
*  50 states. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=286.82s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act invested over $350 billion in the climate and clean energy, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=288.28s)]
*  and it's probably going to surpass that amount, actually. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=293.26s)]
*  It's been so successful. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=296.02s)]
*  The CHIPS Act allocates billions of dollars to bring back manufacturing in high-tech [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=297.4s)]
*  semiconductors. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=302.2s)]
*  And today, coming full circle, President Biden unveiled that real plan for the site of Donald [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=303.2s)]
*  Trump's failed Foxconn project. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=309.12s)]
*  My predecessor came to Racine with the promise of, quote, reclaiming our country's proud [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  manufacturing legacy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=317.76s)]
*  Well, we had an infrastructure day every week, every week for four years. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=319.4s)]
*  Didn't build a damn thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=324.0s)]
*  Came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=325.52s)]
*  to build the eighth wonder of the world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=330.4s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=333.08s)]
*  Look what happened. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=337.52s)]
*  They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=338.52s)]
*  Foxconn turned out to be just that, a con. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=344.6s)]
*  Go figure. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=349.0s)]
*  Even Fox and friends had to admit that Joe Biden has succeeded where Donald Trump failed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=351.2s)]
*  So Peter, this new AI Microsoft thing, $3 billion, big job creators, that's in Racine. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=357.92s)]
*  Isn't that the same town that Foxconn said, I don't know, five, six years ago, we're going [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=365.92s)]
*  to build a big plant, and they never did? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, and that was a huge Trump announcement back then, and he said that the factory was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=372.8s)]
*  going to be the eighth wonder of the world. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=377.58s)]
*  But then Foxconn decided to really scale back their plans and the land is still available. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=379.5s)]
*  So Microsoft is going in. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=385.06s)]
*  It's going to be good for those people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=386.66s)]
*  Doocy to doocy for the alley of dunk. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=388.82s)]
*  The story of these two plans for Racine, Wisconsin is the story really of Donald Trump versus [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=391.9s)]
*  Joe Biden on domestic political economy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=397.02s)]
*  Donald Trump's policy was a con job. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=400.42s)]
*  While Joe Biden and the Democratic Party really have actually undertaken across the entire [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  administrative state, the entire government legislatively, a very serious granular project [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=407.38s)]
*  to rebuild America's manufacturing base, to create good paying, often unionized jobs [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=413.42s)]
*  for people across the country, even in and specifically in areas that didn't vote for [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=417.98s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  And the project is having real results, is succeeding. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=424.18s)]
*  And today, that contrast was on full display. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNVTABHDsHE&t=427.1s)]
