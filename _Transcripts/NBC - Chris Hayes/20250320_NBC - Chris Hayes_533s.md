Video Description: “If things go really wrong, it's not Elon Musk is going to suffer. The risks are spread very unevenly through the population. And so he's playing with fire, but he'll never get burned,” says best-selling author Michael Lewis, editor of the new book, “Who is Government?: The Untold Story of Public Service.”

# ‘Elon Musk is playing with fire—but he’ll never get burned’: Michael Lewis
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw)
*  We now have a bunch of people in our federal government who are from Silicon Valley, where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=0.0s)]
*  a common motto is move fast and break things. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  And you can see how that's working so far. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=6.48s)]
*  Journalist Michael Lewis probably understands this better than anyone, having written multiple [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=9.88s)]
*  bestselling books about Wall Street and Silicon Valley and now the federal government and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=12.64s)]
*  its civil servants, writing, Democratic government isn't really designed to highlight the individual [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=17.8s)]
*  achievement on unelected officials. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=22.84s)]
*  Never a word about who these people are, where they come from, or whatever occurred to them [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=25.3s)]
*  to bother. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=29.72s)]
*  Nothing to change the picture in your head when you hear the word bureaucrat. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=30.72s)]
*  Nothing to arouse curiosity about them or lead you to ask what they do or why they do [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=34.12s)]
*  it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=38.44s)]
*  This new book is called Who Is Government? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=39.44s)]
*  The Unsold Story of Public Service. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=41.28s)]
*  It's a collection of essays he both contributed to and edited. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And Michael Lewis joins me now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=46.5s)]
*  Michael, it's great to have you back on the program. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=48.04s)]
*  This is a fantastic collection and is proving to be way more prophetic and essential than [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=49.56s)]
*  I think I thought it was, even when I read many of these when they first appeared before [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=58.16s)]
*  the election. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=62.64s)]
*  You know, what led me to it in the first place was having wandered into the federal government [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=63.64s)]
*  and done some long-form narrative stuff. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=70.84s)]
*  I was just shocked by the quality of the literary material, the quality of the characters, like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=73.44s)]
*  the seriousness of what they were doing, but also just how interesting it all was. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  And it was largely neglected. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=85.2s)]
*  And there was this feeling that every time I opened the door to a new department, I was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=88.36000000000001s)]
*  discovering something that no one knew about, which is crazy, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  We should know our government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=96.48s)]
*  But the fact that people really didn't know what was going on inside the government and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=98.06s)]
*  what these people were doing ended up being a precondition for what's going on now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=103.04s)]
*  It's like we didn't know what we had, so people are a little bewildered by Elon Musk and what [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  he's doing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=113.72s)]
*  They don't have an ability to really defend themselves intellectually from it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=114.88s)]
*  And in fact, I think you said in one interview that like half the people in the book have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=118.16s)]
*  either been fired or basically lost their jobs, left or been threatened with firing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=122.6s)]
*  You think about what they're doing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=128.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=130.16s)]
*  And you think about what they're doing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=131.16s)]
*  I mean, it's a national archivist. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=132.16s)]
*  It's a guy who figured out how to stop coal mine roofs from falling on the heads of coal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=134.44s)]
*  miners, a thing that killed 50,000 American coal miners in the last century. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=138.92s)]
*  It's a guy in the IRS who runs the cybercrimes division that has yielded billions for the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=144.16s)]
*  American government. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  And all of them have either resigned, feel threatened and very uncomfortable about talking [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=151.2s)]
*  to the writers who wrote about them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=160.04s)]
*  So the environment's changed overnight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=162.4s)]
*  I mean, it was hard enough to get these stories before Trump came back. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=164.12s)]
*  But now it's like this wall has gone up. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=169.4s)]
*  It's not like they're doing things that are wildly controversial. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  It's sort of things that I think any sensible person would say, God, thank God the government's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=175.64s)]
*  doing that because no one else will. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=179.68s)]
*  And there are thousands of things like this that we just sort of take for granted that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  all of a sudden are threatened. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=188.0s)]
*  I was thinking about, I've been thinking about you a lot with respect to this, particularly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=190.12s)]
*  that book you wrote in the first Trump administration called The Fifth Risk, because it has a really [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=194.88s)]
*  important insight that has really framed the way I think about this, which is it's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=200.0s)]
*  government's job to kind of deal with existential risks or risks on a scale that no one else [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=204.72s)]
*  can deal with, like nuclear holocaust. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=210.68s)]
*  That's like there's no firm that's going to do that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=213.68s)]
*  There's no like startup app that's going to do it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=215.92s)]
*  That's the government's job. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=218.6s)]
*  And it just seems to me that this different cultural views of risk is at the core of the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=219.72s)]
*  watching play out as Elon Musk brings his risk appetite into a federal government that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=226.32s)]
*  has a totally different understanding of it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  And if things go really wrong, it's not Elon Musk who's going to suffer. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=237.04s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  The risks are spread very unevenly through the population. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=241.84s)]
*  And so he's playing with he's playing with fire, but he'll never get burned. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=246.48s)]
*  It's like the rest of us get burned. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=251.28s)]
*  And it is true that like this management of risk, this this portfolio of risks, which [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=253.48s)]
*  is vast that the government manages, and they're ones that are obvious, like pandemics or [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=258.4s)]
*  like nuclear weapons going off when they shouldn't. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=264.32s)]
*  But there are a lot of ones that are just not that obvious, like, I don't know, there's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=266.64s)]
*  a there's a 50 billion dollar project in eastern Washington to try to clean up the plutonium [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  waste from the plutonium that was created in World War Two to build the bomb that was [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=275.2s)]
*  dropped on, I think, Nagasaki. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=280.6s)]
*  And if that race isn't cleaned up, it seeps into the Columbia River and the whole Pacific [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=282.84s)]
*  Northwest is kind of spoiled. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=286.52s)]
*  But there are things so that there's this portfolio of stuff and mainly long term projects. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=289.12s)]
*  And there's just been up till now this assumption that the government will churn along and deal [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=294.44s)]
*  with the problem as is dealt with a problem. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=298.64s)]
*  And he's come in and stuck a wrench in all these things. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=300.64s)]
*  And, you know, the it's sort of the the metaphor that pops to my mind is that we're always [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=303.88s)]
*  kind of playing the game of Russian roulette and he's just sticking more bullets in the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=310.04s)]
*  chamber. And it's an interesting thing to me is going to be to see when the when the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=313.56s)]
*  first bad thing really happens that everybody's aware of, are we able to connect it back in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=318.36s)]
*  our minds to what they're doing now? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=323.56s)]
*  Because we should. But there's going to be this counter narrative that, you know, a false [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=325.0s)]
*  counter narrative that they had nothing to do with it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is the big ones I think about all the time, you know, really front of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  mind because we live through covid as pandemics, because we've got this bird flu situation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=337.76s)]
*  We've also got there's a whole bunch of reasons to think that we're as exposed or even more to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=342.68s)]
*  a pandemic and also some kind of catastrophic terrorist attack or catastrophic attack of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=346.92s)]
*  some kind. But again, these are very difficult things to manage. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=351.52s)]
*  You know, it takes a bunch of things outside of your control. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=354.96s)]
*  But ultimately, I don't like the things they're doing right now are increasing the risk of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=357.88s)]
*  both of those things, obviously, every single day. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=362.4s)]
*  Right. And and, you know, in my mind, it's like, why have we allowed this to happen? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=365.04s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons we've allowed this to happen is we've allowed this sort of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=369.72s)]
*  really mindless stereotype about who the government worker is to infect our minds. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=373.92s)]
*  I mean, it's sort of like we just accept this kind of portrait that gets tossed out of there, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  this wasteful, you know, slightly fraudulent, faceless bureaucrat is kind of a kind of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=383.72s)]
*  unnecessary and that these people have not been sort of dramatized and explained to the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=389.84s)]
*  population. So they have they have no sense of who he is messing with when he goes in to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=394.84s)]
*  mess with people. And it's it's in many cases like these incredibly mission driven, highly [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=399.84s)]
*  expert, totally devoted people who stand between us and oblivion. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=405.84s)]
*  And and we should be kind of the best among us. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=410.84s)]
*  And the fact that we're treating the way we're treating ourselves, we're treating ourselves [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=414.84s)]
*  and treating the way we're treating them is like it's such a it's such an indictment of the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=418.84s)]
*  society right now. It's it's poisonous. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=423.84s)]
*  It won't it can't last because society can't hold together if it's run this way. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=426.84s)]
*  But it's just it's like it's a reflection of a kind of deeper ignorance about about like what our [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=430.84s)]
*  government does and who these people are inside of it, who are doing it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=435.84s)]
*  Yeah. And this we should say the book collection, it does exactly that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=439.84s)]
*  These are essentially profile pieces. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=443.84s)]
*  It's sort of dimensionalized character pieces about various civil servants doing what they're doing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=445.84s)]
*  So it's I you know, it's all this I saw this literary material and I dragged in all these literary [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=450.84s)]
*  people to exploit it. It's mainly kind of novelist types, but we sort of just dropped them in and said, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=456.84s)]
*  didn't know brief. It's like, go find the story. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=462.84s)]
*  And and they were all of them were spoiled for choice. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=465.84s)]
*  It was like they couldn't believe just how rich the environment was. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=468.84s)]
*  And and what they end up doing is sort of with one exception. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=472.84s)]
*  One of the writers, John Lanchester, actually takes his care of the consumer character, the consumer price index. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=475.84s)]
*  Right. And explains like one of the things the government does is count stuff. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=481.84s)]
*  Yeah. But but the others pick these people and you read it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYX9aNkatw&t=485.84s)]
