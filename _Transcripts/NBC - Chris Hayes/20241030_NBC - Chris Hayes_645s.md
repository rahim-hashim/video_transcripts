# ‘The 2020 playbook’: Trump expected to declare victory no matter the outcome
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and we are six days out from election day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=0.0s)]
*  It is shaping up to be one of the closest elections anyone has seen in US history, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=4.0s)]
*  certainly in the modern era of polling. We got a ton of polls nationally and the key seven swing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  states basically all showing a dead heat between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=14.96s)]
*  If you watch this program, if you're someone in what we used to call the reality-based community, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=21.04s)]
*  I think you understand that this is a very tight race in a closely divided country that genuinely [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=25.6s)]
*  could go either way. The story on the right is not that. Joe, how's it gonna end? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Landslide for Trump electorally. He wins every swing state. They are throwing everything they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  can as Donald Trump's early voting numbers are great, as his odds in the betting markets are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  ascendant. It's over. Donald Trump's got this. I don't see where the votes come from for Kamala [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=47.6s)]
*  Harris. She's not a good candidate and the issues are on the side of Donald Trump. He wins this. He [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=53.2s)]
*  wins this quite easily. Save the tape. Play it back if I'm wrong. The race is over, but the integrity [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=58.88s)]
*  of the election is still in question. Now this is just a sampling and it comes from the top, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  but the story on the right has been for a while that Trump is cruising to victory, that he's way [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  ahead, but the Harris campaign has collapsed. The only way they can win is stealing it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=74.72s)]
*  That is not at all what the available data says, not what the polls are saying. It's just as untrue [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=80.24s)]
*  as it was four years ago, but it hasn't stopped Donald Trump from telling the same lies on the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=86.0s)]
*  campaign trail this year. They're gonna cheat. They cheat. That's all they want to do is cheat. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=90.88s)]
*  And when you see this, it's the only way they're gonna win. And we can't let that happen. And we [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=97.36s)]
*  can't let it happen again. We're gonna have no country. Are they cheating, Michael? They're [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=103.36s)]
*  trying, but they're not going to get away with it, right? If we win and when we win, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=108.4s)]
*  we're going to prosecute people that cheat on this election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  And if we can, we'll go back to the last one too. Now again, as far as we can tell, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=119.76s)]
*  Donald Trump can very well just win this election outright in six days. He might, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  but as he's been telegraphing for four years, the plan, the definite plan, is to cheat and to sow [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=129.36s)]
*  doubt about the outcome in advance so he can claim the election has been stolen, just like [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=136.24s)]
*  he did last time. In fact, yesterday, one of the ex-cons advising Donald Trump put on three shirts [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=140.8s)]
*  and gave a press conference after getting out of jail. Almost immediately, Steve Bannon said [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=146.08s)]
*  Trump's main mistake on election night in 2020 was that he took too long to falsely declare victory, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  a mistake he said Trump shouldn't make again this year. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=156.4s)]
*  President Trump came up at 2 30 in the morning and talked. He should have done it at 11 o'clock [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  at night in 2020. Okay. He said, I'm urging President Trump, if the votes come in like it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=165.28s)]
*  looks like they're going to come in, he should step up and inform the American citizens of exactly [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=172.88s)]
*  what's going on and not keep people in the dark like was done in 2020. Okay, so this is all clear [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=178.8s)]
*  as day, right? We're all seeing this. They're doing it on camera into microphones, not like [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=183.6s)]
*  running around in the dark. They are running the same stop the steal playbook as they did four years [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=186.8s)]
*  ago when they lost an election by like four and a half points. That would be, of course, the coup [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=190.64s)]
*  attempt that Trump and dozens of others are still facing prosecution for. In fact, this evening, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=195.6s)]
*  a reporter asked Trump about his election night plans while the ex president was dressed in a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  reflective vest climbing into his Trump branded garbage truck. Could you imagine any circumstances [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  under which you would be defeated, but not say that the election was stolen? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=210.56s)]
*  If it was a corrupt election, that could happen. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=215.04s)]
*  Do you anticipate to declare victory on election night? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  I hope that we're going to declare a victory. I mean, they spend all that money on machines. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=222.4s)]
*  It's like very sad when you get machines, you pay all that money and they talk about three days [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=226.56s)]
*  later. I think we're going to have a big enough victory to maybe have it that night. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=231.28s)]
*  To the extent that you could make any kind of like coherent propositional content [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=237.76s)]
*  those statements, which is often a challenge. It's basically the same schtick, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=242.24s)]
*  This time, the Republican central message is getting an enormous signal boost, not just from [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=247.04s)]
*  Fox, of course, where it is, but from the social media platform X and its owner, Elon Musk, the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=251.04s)]
*  Trump loving reactionary billionaire, the world's biggest broker of disinformation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=256.88s)]
*  That's just one place where Trump and his allies are now posting false claims about cheating at [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=261.44s)]
*  large scale levels in Pennsylvania early voting. On Wednesday, it turned out there might be some [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=265.92s)]
*  voter fraud being committed, not in Pennsylvania, not by Democrats. In fact, on Tuesday, Indiana [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=271.12s)]
*  state police said they had arrested a Republican precinct committee man and former congressional [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=276.16s)]
*  candidate named Larry Savage. Police say he stole two ballots from a test of voting machines [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=281.52s)]
*  and then claimed the machines were flawed. According to court documents, investigators also [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=286.96s)]
*  searched his phone and found a text that morning reading, sis, they say anything about the ballots [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=292.72s)]
*  I took. Investigators also say he posted on a social media page condemning Madison County [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=298.08s)]
*  election procedures after taking those ballots. Police found the ballots in his truck later that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  day. This is one of the worst things that can happen given the national climate about integrity [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=308.8s)]
*  of elections to intentionally steal ballots and then attack the system. I can't imagine a bigger [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  disservice to our community than that. Just to be clear, this genius went and stole ballots after [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=322.08s)]
*  a machine test and then posted about how like there was a miscount and then they found the ballots in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=328.88s)]
*  his truck. Okay. Meanwhile, as Republicans are setting the scene for again, another attempt [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=333.28s)]
*  to overturn the election is basically a declaration of victory independent of what the voters decide. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=338.96s)]
*  What Democrats are left doing is the work of democracy, which is trying to win, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=343.44s)]
*  To do what they did in 2020 and 2022, which is to get people who they have persuaded to agree with [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=347.76s)]
*  them on the issues to go out and vote and to win a close race. David Pluff is a senior advisor for [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=353.92s)]
*  the Harris campaign and he joins me now here in New York City. It's good to see you. I feel like [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=359.68s)]
*  you've got much more important work since the last time that we spoke. We were just, we were sharing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=364.24s)]
*  takes on cable news. Now you've got a real job. How are you feeling? Good. It's going to be close, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=369.44s)]
*  but we like what we're seeing in early vote. We like who the undecided voters are. I think we [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=374.48s)]
*  have momentum at the end. What they're doing right now is super puzzling. Doesn't betray any confidence, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  by the way. Not so ever. There are still undecided voters out there and they don't like this stuff. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's also, I think, not a great signal to send to your supporters that you think you've got it in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=389.12s)]
*  the bag or have stolen. We saw what happened in the Georgia Senate runoffs really hurt Republican [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=394.24s)]
*  turnout. So this is going to be super close. We're just sticking to our knitting here and trying to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=399.12s)]
*  turn out every voter we can. But he's not closing a presidential race particularly well. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=402.96s)]
*  When we talk about close, I mean, people come up to me and I'm sure in your life all the time, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=408.0s)]
*  to the extent that you're not just change your desk. And it's like, they say, like, I have some [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=412.96s)]
*  secret knowledge what's going to happen. And I say, we just got the data we have, which is like a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=416.96s)]
*  very close race. There's no, I want to just affirm this. You guys aren't sitting on some secret data. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, obviously more data than what we have publicly, but like from your view, it looks like [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=426.56s)]
*  what we're seeing a lot more data as the Trump campaign. And they're not acting like a campaign [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=431.52s)]
*  that's incredibly confident. Like this Pennsylvania temper tantrum is all about Trump, I'm sure, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=436.4s)]
*  being briefed on early vote numbers, not liking them and wanting to be able to declare at 11 as [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  Steve Bannon said he's going to win because he's likely going to be ahead in the count at that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=447.68s)]
*  point. So we have a lot of data. But what it has shown us from the very beginning, when Kamala Harris [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  entered this race, we were losing by quite a bit. We've been able to get that narrowed to basically [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=455.44s)]
*  a dead heat race everywhere. But, you know, listen, I think if we're going to be surprised [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=460.88s)]
*  on the upside on election night, it may be that we do even better with women voters than public [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=465.28s)]
*  polling and even our own data shows. That's the only surprise. What we're seeing is basically [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=469.44s)]
*  this thing's going to come down to 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, one point in all seven states. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=474.8s)]
*  If that's the case, right, there's not a big polling mess because there could be. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=483.2s)]
*  No one knows what the future, right? And it could be in either direction. Just want to be clear on [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=487.44s)]
*  this, right? What's most important in the next six days? Like from your perspective? Well, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=490.48s)]
*  and I would say this, we're being enormously conservative in our own data around Trump, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=497.04s)]
*  you know, saying, OK, he surprised us in 16 and 20. So let's make sure we are giving him [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=500.88s)]
*  the strongest performance. Yes. And I think a lot of public pollsters do that. So for us, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  we've got Kamala Harris, Tim Walls, surrogates all over the battlegrounds, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=511.04s)]
*  reaching those few undecided voters that are left are important, trying to encourage people to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  vote early, to volunteer. And then the most important thing is on the ground, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=519.04s)]
*  because in all these states, some are going to have well over 50 percent of the vote cast by [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=523.68s)]
*  the election day, some a third. So it's a more narrow list of people. And you say, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=528.0s)]
*  I know Chris is voting for me and he hasn't voted yet. I want to talk to him multiple times. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  This is an important point I just want to make for folks that are thinking about the race, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=538.8s)]
*  wherever, whatever their politics are. And I think you should vote whatever your politics are, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=542.24s)]
*  that the early vote, early vote is good for campaigns. If it's for them, right. For two [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=545.6s)]
*  reasons. One, you don't want to leave anything chance, enormous freak blizzard. But to reiterate [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWNyv-zx5A&t=554.96s)]
