# Dem rep 199 Republicans voted for 'Insurrection Caucus' leader for speaker
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco)
*  Congressman Pete Aguilar is a Democrat at California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=0.0s)]
*  He served on the January 6th committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=2.64s)]
*  He is now chair of the House Democratic Caucus in leadership, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=4.04s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=6.92s)]
*  Congressman, I know that you, obviously, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=8.88s)]
*  the folks on the Democratic side are not being, you know, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=10.84s)]
*  you're not part of the plan here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=12.72s)]
*  This is a sort of partisan affair or has been up until now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=14.36s)]
*  Do you have an understanding of what tomorrow will bring? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=17.64s)]
*  Well, I'm learning from Ryan Nobles there, too. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=22.16s)]
*  We know what has been made public, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=25.16s)]
*  which is we may have votes tomorrow [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=27.24s)]
*  and that Jim Jordan is dead set on making his colleagues vote. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=30.08s)]
*  And just as the reporting is mentioned, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=35.72s)]
*  and we're, you know, we're feet from the House chamber right now [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=38.0s)]
*  and he keeps losing votes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=41.32s)]
*  He cannot count to 217. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=42.96s)]
*  And so we are in this position in this holding pattern [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=46.76s)]
*  because Jim Jordan is the most extreme member [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=49.84s)]
*  on that side of the aisle. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=54.36s)]
*  He is the leader of the insurrection caucus over there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=55.88s)]
*  And it's just terribly unfortunate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=60.56s)]
*  that this is the position that we're in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=62.96s)]
*  and that Republicans have elevated. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=64.36s)]
*  And I just think it says a lot about the group [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=66.12s)]
*  that 199 of them still say, yeah, that's our guy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=67.92s)]
*  You have made, you've made overtures [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=73.16s)]
*  about some sort of bipartisan resolution. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader, has. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=77.56s)]
*  But I can't tell if this is like rhetoric [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=79.56s)]
*  where you're saying, well, it would be nice. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=82.56s)]
*  Or is there any active conversation plan back channels [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=84.24s)]
*  happening right now with any Republican members [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=88.52s)]
*  about some bipartisan resolution to this? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  There are always active conversations with members [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  on the other side of the aisle. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  After 15 days without a speaker, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=99.64s)]
*  I would hope that there are conversations happening. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  And I know that they are. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=104.6s)]
*  And so, you know, our hope is leader Jeffries laid out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  Our first primary responsibility this week [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=110.0s)]
*  was to make sure the head of the MAGA circus, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=112.64s)]
*  Jim Jordan, didn't become speaker. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=116.2s)]
*  Our second objective is to make sure [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=118.44s)]
*  we open up the people's house. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=120.32s)]
*  So we are having conversations, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=122.52s)]
*  private conversations with our colleagues [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=124.64s)]
*  to make sure that that happens. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=127.0s)]
*  They control the votes here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=129.52s)]
*  And so it's up to them to see [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=131.16s)]
*  what the path forward looks like. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=134.04s)]
*  But this is more than just, you know, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=136.24s)]
*  empty rhetoric and talking points. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=138.44s)]
*  This is a real desire to want to make this place function, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=140.6s)]
*  make the Congress, make the house function again, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=145.4s)]
*  and to make sure that we are carrying on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=148.96s)]
*  the people's business. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=150.72s)]
*  Because we have such urgent priorities to do, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=151.56s)]
*  we have to make sure we avoid government shutdown. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=154.16s)]
*  We have to make sure we're providing aid [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=157.2s)]
*  to Israel and Ukraine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=159.16s)]
*  Those are the things that, by the way, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=160.6s)]
*  have 300 votes plus in Congress. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=162.72s)]
*  Let's just make sure that we have an opportunity [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  to deliver for the American public. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=168.16s)]
*  Yesterday, or the day before, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=171.44s)]
*  I think it was yesterday, Hakim Jeffries [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=173.12s)]
*  explicitly referenced the current Speaker Pro Tem, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=174.84s)]
*  Patrick McHenry, as someone that he respected, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  that Democrats respect. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=181.08s)]
*  There is clearly some plan being circulated [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=183.0s)]
*  to extend the powers of the Speaker Pro Tem [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=186.08s)]
*  through the end of January [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=190.28s)]
*  to basically run the House like the Speaker. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  It was interesting to me that both Newt Gingrich [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=194.28s)]
*  and John Boehner endorsed that plan, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=196.24s)]
*  now that they have any say in it either way. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=198.64s)]
*  What do you make of that plan? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=200.72s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=202.2s)]
*  Well, this isn't just about one person. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of us have respect for Patrick McHenry [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  and how he's trying to conduct himself [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  and organize this election. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=211.32s)]
*  That can't be an easy job that he was elevated to. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=213.55999999999997s)]
*  But our primary responsibility is to make sure [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=217.04s)]
*  that the House functions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=220.48s)]
*  So it's not about one person. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  We will wait to see if a Republican introduces [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=223.72s)]
*  a resolution to do that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=227.44s)]
*  I've read the public reporting that you have as well, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=229.4s)]
*  but the details matter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=231.84s)]
*  For House Democrats, the language of these policies [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=233.8s)]
*  and proposals matter, and so we'll see what it says. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=237.2s)]
*  Can I ask, this is like super in the weeds [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=239.88s)]
*  and you may not know, and I don't know if anyone knows, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=242.16s)]
*  but how does that even work under the rules? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=245.36s)]
*  Like, are the rules at every recess you come back [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=247.52s)]
*  and vote for Speaker, can someone introduce a resolution? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=251.04s)]
*  Like, I don't even actually understand procedurally [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=253.56s)]
*  this liminal space in which you currently exist. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=255.84s)]
*  Sure, potentially this could be, right now, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=259.56s)]
*  the highest order of business is electing a Speaker. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=262.48s)]
*  And so someone could offer a privileged resolution [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=265.36s)]
*  to move to an election, just like Elise Stefanik has done [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=269.04s)]
*  to have the Republicans nominate Jim Jordan again, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=273.16s)]
*  or someone else could offer a resolution that does this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=277.12s)]
*  And there is precedent for it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  There used to be a Speaker Pro Tem, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=283.6s)]
*  designated at times when the Speaker was out of session [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=286.2s)]
*  for a week or a month. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=289.88s)]
*  It hasn't been done since the 90s, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=291.76s)]
*  but that individual would function just as the Speaker does [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=294.64s)]
*  for a limited time period [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  until the Speaker came back from vacation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is precedent from years ago. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=301.84s)]
*  All right, Congressman Pete Aguilar, thank you very much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=304.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcalVMNYco&t=307.32s)]
