# 'Betrayal' North Carolina lawmaker who switched parties was courted by GOP before election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc)
*  You may remember Tricia Cotham. She is the state representative in North Carolina who abruptly switched from Democratic to Republican this past spring. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=0.0s)]
*  Cotham's switch handed the GOP gerrymandered state legislature their a veto-proof majority. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=8.0s)]
*  It allowed them to ram through a 12-week abortion ban that was opposed by the state's Democratic governor. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=15.0s)]
*  The ban not only takes away the rights of pregnant women in that state, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=20.0s)]
*  but it also hurts people from other southern states with abortion bans who had been traveling to North Carolina for health care. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=23.0s)]
*  And this was all possible because of party-switching Tricia Cotham, who voted with her fellow Republicans for the ban. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=29.0s)]
*  It was weird because several years before in 2015, Cotham drew national attention for sharing her own abortion story on the floor of the North Carolina State House. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=36.0s)]
*  My first pregnancy ended in an induced physician-assisted miscarriage. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=46.0s)]
*  While I served in this chamber, my doctor told me that this pregnancy would likely not be viable. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=53.0s)]
*  And that if I did not take swift medical action, my life and any hope of future babies would be in severe danger. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=61.0s)]
*  Abortion is a deeply personal decision. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=76.0s)]
*  It should not be a political debate. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=79.0s)]
*  My womb and my uterus is not up for your political grab. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=83.0s)]
*  So what on earth led that person, someone who spoke out passionately for abortion rights and just ran last year as a pro-choice Democrat, to suddenly betray her voters? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=90.0s)]
*  Two New York Times reporters did a deep dive on the very suspicious party-switching of Tricia Cotham that, quote, blew up North Carolina politics. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=100.0s)]
*  Kate Kelly, a Washington correspondent for the New York Times, was on that story, and she joins me now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=109.0s)]
*  Kate, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=114.0s)]
*  You report that some big-name North Carolina party figures encouraged Cotham to run in the primary in 2022. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=116.0s)]
*  But they weren't Democratic party figures, were they? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=123.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=126.0s)]
*  The majority leader of the Republican Party then and now, John Bell, spoke to Tricia Cotham before she filed for the primary last March and encouraged her to run. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=127.0s)]
*  And we also learned that the Speaker of the House, Republican Tim Moore, who was Speaker last term and is now, encouraged her to run along the way, although he said he hadn't talked to her before the primary. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=135.0s)]
*  So we know that from the very get-go, GOP sort of deep-rooted interests within North Carolina were backing Tricia Cotham. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=146.0s)]
*  They say they didn't know that she was going to switch parties. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=155.0s)]
*  They say they regarded her as a centrist Democrat in a redrawn district that was going to go to a Democrat regardless, so they wanted someone who would reach across the aisle. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=158.0s)]
*  And to be fair, that is some of her history, is sort of collaborative impulses with Republicans on the side of the aisle. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=167.0s)]
*  And she ran with Republicans on certain issues. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=175.0s)]
*  However, you're very right to point out that she ran on a pro-choice agenda. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=177.0s)]
*  She ran as an ally to the LGBTQ community. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=181.0s)]
*  She ran as someone that was going to give local sheriffs autonomy when it came to going along with ICE, among many other policy positions that she has now effectively reversed with her votes, commentary and other signals. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=184.0s)]
*  Yes. And you guys write how Tricia Cotham's victory in November helped Democrats lock in enough seats to prevent by a single vote a Republican supermajority in the statehouse. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=198.0s)]
*  And then just three months after she took office, as we've discussed, she switches parties. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=207.0s)]
*  I wonder what has been the reaction in her district? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=211.0s)]
*  Oh, bitterness, betrayal, anger. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=215.0s)]
*  And, you know, she's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=218.0s)]
*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=224.0s)]
*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=226.0s)]

*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=230.0s)]
*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=232.0s)]
*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=234.0s)]
*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=236.0s)]
*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=238.0s)]

*  She's had some pretty awful things to contend with since April 5th when she switched. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=242.0s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=244.0s)]

*  I feel like we see that with Kistin Cinema [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=302.0s)]
*  and Joe Manchin too in the Senate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's the reaction that I've heard [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=306.0s)]
*  from a lot of people in the last day or so [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=308.0s)]
*  is that this seemed like it was about petty personal rivalries. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=310.0s)]
*  It was about a feeling of personal injury. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=312.0s)]
*  And it's interesting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=314.0s)]
*  The campaign consultant you mentioned [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=316.0s)]
*  told me that there was almost a very Trumpian [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=318.0s)]
*  kind of narcissistic approach here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=320.0s)]
*  kind of narcissistic approach here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=322.0s)]
*  Like, everyone's against me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=324.0s)]
*  They used to be for me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=326.0s)]
*  But she, even before she switched stances, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=328.0s)]
*  she was frustrated at not getting, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=330.0s)]
*  for example, the endorsement of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=332.0s)]
*  But she also did not attend the board meetings [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=334.0s)]
*  But she also did not attend the board meetings [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=336.0s)]
*  with that group that are required to get a candidate endorsement. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=338.0s)]
*  with that group that are required to get a candidate endorsement. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=340.0s)]
*  And ironically, when she came into office in January, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=342.0s)]
*  And ironically, when she came into office in January, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=344.0s)]
*  she soon co-sponsored a bill that would have codified [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=346.0s)]
*  Roe vs. Wade in North Carolina. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=348.0s)]
*  Now think about that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=350.0s)]
*  I mean, you're quite right to quote her famous floor speech from 2015 [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=352.0s)]
*  that's very much of a pro-choice clarion call. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=354.0s)]
*  But as recently as late January of this year, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=356.0s)]
*  But as recently as late January of this year, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=358.0s)]
*  she was a co-sponsor on a Roe bill. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=360.0s)]
*  And within, you know, three, four months, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=362.0s)]
*  she reverses her stance on what had proved to be a critical issue. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=364.0s)]
*  she reverses her stance on what had proved to be a critical issue. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=366.0s)]
*  Because this state was very much a destination, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=368.0s)]
*  like a very rare oasis of access for abortion within the Deep South [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=370.0s)]
*  Like a very rare oasis of access for abortion within the Deep South [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=372.0s)]
*  up until July 1st. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=374.0s)]
*  up until July 1st. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=376.0s)]
*  So I've got to ask, Kate, in your reporting, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=378.0s)]
*  Did you get to the bottom of all this, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=380.0s)]
*  what you highlight there? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=382.0s)]
*  I think it's a very interesting point, Kate, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=384.0s)]
*  because she's a progressive pro-choice Democrat [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=386.0s)]
*  because she's a progressive pro-choice Democrat [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=388.0s)]
*  when she's in the state house before. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=390.0s)]
*  Then she goes out of office. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=392.0s)]
*  She co-founds a lobbying firm where one of her partners was a major donor [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=394.0s)]
*  to state Republicans and also president of a company [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=396.0s)]
*  that built charter schools, which she was once against. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=398.0s)]
*  She comes back into office as a Democrat [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=400.0s)]
*  only briefly and then switches to the Republicans. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=402.0s)]
*  You report that Republicans were pushing her to run. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=404.0s)]
*  You report that Republicans were pushing her to run. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=406.0s)]
*  So am I allowed to speculate and say, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=408.0s)]
*  So am I allowed to speculate and say, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=410.0s)]
*  Do we have evidence of that? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=412.0s)]
*  Well, that's the open question. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=414.0s)]
*  I can't say more than I have learned through the reporting. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwCy7iUukc&t=416.0s)]
