# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 16  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=0.0s)]
*  The decision desk is projecting lower than expected turnout tonight in Iowa. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=4.2s)]
*  About that turnout. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  If you're sick, if you're just so sick you can't turn it, I don't think, get up. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Tonight, the case for optimism after the caucus. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=16.96s)]
*  Almost half of the base of the Republican Party showing up for this caucus tonight voted [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=21.12s)]
*  against Donald Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=27.46s)]
*  And the Republican front runner liable for sexual assault returns to court for jury selection. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=29.32s)]
*  Plus. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=34.8s)]
*  Should we expect to see you on the debate stage in New Hampshire? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=35.8s)]
*  Is Trump going to be on the debate stage? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=39.2s)]
*  Nikki Haley's latest move to squeeze out Ron DeSantis, what it all means for the Biden [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=41.24s)]
*  campaign come November, and a serious point about conducting elections with Ziploc bags [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  and popcorn buckets. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=51.32s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=53.08s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=59.52s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=60.52s)]
*  The very first votes of the 2024 election have now been cast. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=61.52s)]
*  There were no big surprises in Iowa last night as Donald Trump did cruise to victory. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=65.16s)]
*  Fifty one percent of the total vote. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=69.52s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came in a distant second, earning the support of 21 percent [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=72.0s)]
*  of Republican caucus goers, followed closely by Nikki Haley with 19 percent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=76.2s)]
*  In fact, the ex president won 98 out of 99 counties in Iowa, all without spending anywhere [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=80.8s)]
*  near as much time in the state as his rivals or even as much time as he spent in New York [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=87.24s)]
*  courtrooms. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=90.8s)]
*  Now, of course, the ex president and his allies are selling this as an enormous victory. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=91.8s)]
*  They want the story coming out of Iowa to be that Donald Trump has once again imposed [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=96.6s)]
*  his will over the Republican Party. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=101.64s)]
*  He's now cruising to the nomination. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=103.28s)]
*  He will soon reclaim his throne in Washington. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=105.12s)]
*  He's inevitable. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=107.56s)]
*  And it all may feel like a frightening inevitability. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=108.56s)]
*  And there is, I will say, a lot to be scared about. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=111.64s)]
*  I don't think I hold back on that score. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=114.64s)]
*  But I also think last night's results demonstrated that Donald Trump has some huge fundamental [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=117.72s)]
*  weaknesses that are just there staring us in the face. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=122.68s)]
*  Now these were the coldest caucuses in Iowa history, which is saying something. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=126.28s)]
*  People had to brave wind chills as low as negative 30 degrees. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=130.24s)]
*  They had to trudge through piles of snow and icy roads to get to their precincts. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=133.08s)]
*  And it is fair to assume that only the most passionate amped up voters would venture out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=137.28s)]
*  in that kind of weather. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=142.96s)]
*  And in the end, of that small group of people willing to do this, go out on a Monday night, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  barely a majority supported Donald Trump, the man who is supposed to be their unanimous [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  beloved leader. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=154.36s)]
*  Just about half of all the Iowa caucus goers actually came out through the wind and the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=156.58s)]
*  snow and the ice to support someone else. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=161.88s)]
*  And that lack of enthusiasm is also reflected in the turnout numbers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  There were about 115,000 people that turned out last night compared to 186,000 back in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=170.68s)]
*  2016. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=176.52s)]
*  Now, some of that dip was likely due to the weather. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=177.52s)]
*  But remember, caucuses always take place in the dead of winter. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=180.12s)]
*  Compare Trump's winning vote total to that of Senator Ted Cruz back in 2016. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=185.0s)]
*  Trump won with just over 56,000 votes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=190.24s)]
*  That's only about 4,500 more than Cruz eight years ago. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=193.08s)]
*  So this is the first snapshot we have of the 2024 election and doesn't fit with the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=197.6s)]
*  narrative that we hear all the time that Republicans are just crazy for their cult leader Donald [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=201.82s)]
*  Trump across the board, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=207.2s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=208.64s)]
*  There are more than 750,000 registered Republicans in the state of Iowa. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=210.6s)]
*  115,000 of them showed up to caucus last night. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=215.16s)]
*  Just 56,250 voted for the ex-president. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=219.0s)]
*  That's like less than 2% of the population of Iowa. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=223.72s)]
*  There were more people in the stands for the last Hawkeyes home game than the number [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=227.28s)]
*  that voted for Trump. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=232.0s)]
*  Then there's the entrance polling out of Iowa last night. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=234.08s)]
*  A third of the people that showed up in that cold and wind, a third of caucus goers said [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=236.76s)]
*  that they would not consider Donald Trump to be fit for president if he is convicted [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=241.88s)]
*  of a crime. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=246.96s)]
*  I got to say, that was probably the most interesting result from our entrance polling last night. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=247.96s)]
*  That number is higher than I would have guessed by quite a bit, and that's a big chunk of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=254.24s)]
*  voters. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=258.52s)]
*  It really emphasizes the enormous risk to the Republican Party if they go ahead and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=259.8s)]
*  nominate this guy who's been indicted 91 times. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=266.08s)]
*  He very well may be convicted of more than one crime before the election November. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=268.98s)]
*  If that happens, I think it's fair to say, even if all those people that said they would [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  consider him unfit aren't going to vote against him, right? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=277.68s)]
*  It's going to be some smaller sliver, but there's going to be huge political consequences [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=281.2s)]
*  to a conviction. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  The polling also reminds us that amid the repeated claims that the prosecutions of Trump [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=287.12s)]
*  are political, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=292.0s)]
*  There is a very real difference between being indicted and being found guilty by a jury [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=294.32s)]
*  of your peers. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=300.32s)]
*  Then finally, I think we need to look at all this information from Iowa in the context [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=301.32s)]
*  of one more detail about the national electorate. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=307.16s)]
*  So according to the Biden campaign's internal research, this is fascinating. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=310.52s)]
*  The majority of undecided voters, those are people who don't know who they're going to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=314.28s)]
*  vote for in the general, nearly three quarters of them do not believe that Donald Trump is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=317.4s)]
*  going to be the Republican nominee. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=322.2s)]
*  Campaign officials say that is due in large part to the fact that these voters are just [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=325.2s)]
*  not paying attention. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=328.44s)]
*  You can't conceive of how tuned out these folks are. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  Now that might be hard to imagine if you are a regular viewer of this network. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=332.88s)]
*  MSNBC viewers hear a lot about the ex-president because we spend a lot of time discussing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  how he is a singular threat to American democracy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  But out in the broader world, Donald Trump is simply not front of mind. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  He has not been in everyone's face all the time, as he was back in 2016 when he first [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  ran for president. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  He's not the number one story in every news outlet every day, commanding attention as [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  he was during his years in the White House when he was the president. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=361.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is an exhausting and unpleasant person to think about, so it's totally understandable [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=365.36s)]
*  and rational. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  A whole lot of people have been trying not to think about him much over the past few [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  years. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=375.76s)]
*  But very soon, that's going to become a lot more difficult. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump is about to once again become the center of mainstream public attention in a way that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=381.36s)]
*  has not been the case since he tried to overthrow the government three years ago. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  As McKay Coppins explains in A New Peaceful Atlantic, for many Americans, the former president [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=390.92s)]
*  has become an abstraction. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=394.92s)]
*  But watching him speak, as Coppins did at a rally in Mason City, Iowa, early this month, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=397.12s)]
*  is, quote, both instantly familiar and still somehow shocking, like rewatching an old movie [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=401.36s)]
*  you saw a hundred times as a kid, but whose most offensive jokes you'd forgotten. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  To be re-exposed to Donald Trump is to be shocked anew at his sheer depravity and unfitness [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  for any office. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is exactly what is about to happen to a lot of Americans who have not been reading [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=419.44s)]
*  the absolutely deranged things he says day in, day out on Truth Social or hearing the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=423.28s)]
*  disgusting rhetoric he spews on stage at those very rallies. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=430.36s)]
*  And I can almost hear you groaning for your couch right now at the idea of having to see [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=434.44s)]
*  and hear him again like that day in, day out. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=438.32s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of people who think the more attention Donald Trump gets, the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=442.36s)]
*  stronger he gets. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=445.24s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=446.24s)]
*  I think history shows that's not true. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=447.24s)]
*  The more attention he gets, the more people see him and hear him behaving abominably, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=449.26s)]
*  the less they like him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=454.34s)]
*  Just look at this today. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=457.32s)]
*  What does he do after Iowa? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=459.98s)]
*  He shows up at the second defamation trial brought by the woman he had been found liable [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=461.18s)]
*  for sexually abusing, a woman who says he raped her in a dressing room. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=465.78s)]
*  The day after his win in Iowa, Trump could not help himself from going there to glower [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=471.08s)]
*  and attempt to intimidate this woman who a jury found was telling the truth while a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=475.94s)]
*  second jury now decides how much more money he must pay her for defaming her for calling [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=481.26s)]
*  her a liar when she says that he raped her. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=486.46s)]
*  So for all the braggadocio about Trump's victory last night, how we should all be very afraid, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=490.3s)]
*  he has profound weaknesses and they are not going away. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=494.78s)]
*  Joining me now is McKay Coppens, staff writer at The Atlantic who wrote that piece I talked [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=499.86s)]
*  about. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=503.5s)]
*  I think it's a piece of partly confirmation bias because it's in line with something I've [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=504.5s)]
*  been thinking about a lot. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=508.3s)]
*  Just tell me why you, the sort of idea of him falling to the back of people's minds [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=510.46s)]
*  and how important it is to sort of to understand what this year will be like and what he will [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=516.9s)]
*  be as a candidate to reacquaint yourself with the fact of him as a candidate. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=521.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you got at it, Chris. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=525.9s)]
*  It is totally understandable that most Americans don't want to spend every day thinking about [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=529.4s)]
*  Donald Trump, right? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=533.86s)]
*  But you have to cast your mind back to 2016. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=535.36s)]
*  Do you remember how all consuming that campaign was, how, you know, watching his rallies day [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=538.46s)]
*  in, day out became this almost kind of perverse national pastime, right? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=544.66s)]
*  That is not the case anymore, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=549.22s)]
*  For many years during that first campaign and throughout his presidency, Americans were [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=552.3000000000001s)]
*  regularly exposed to him. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  That's really not the case. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=557.9s)]
*  And the reason I wrote this piece was because I had kind of joined many of my fellow Americans [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=559.46s)]
*  in tuning him out to a certain extent. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=565.82s)]
*  You know, I've covered probably 100 Trump rallies in my career as a reporter, but I [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=567.98s)]
*  realized recently that it had been since, I think, 2019 since I'd actually gone to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=572.94s)]
*  one. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=578.86s)]
*  So I went to one earlier this month in Mason City, Iowa. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=579.86s)]
*  a really striking experience because you forget, you know, how casually he calls his political [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=583.74s)]
*  opponents idiots and lunatics, the way he talks about immigrants, the way that he casually [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=590.22s)]
*  swears from the podium and the way that people in the crowd kind of swear back at him. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=596.2s)]
*  Like it is a really kind of shocking experience that I think we all, or at least many of us [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=601.26s)]
*  in America, have chosen to stop thinking about. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=607.74s)]
*  But I think you're right that once he reclaims his spot at the center of American life, which [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=610.66s)]
*  I think is probably going to happen pretty soon, I think a lot of Americans are going [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=617.38s)]
*  to realize, you know, that this he's not an abstraction, right? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=621.0799999999999s)]
*  He's not just like a, you know, a bundle of ideological grievances and ideas that they [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=625.5799999999999s)]
*  either like or don't like, that they, you know, horrify them or they find hilarious. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=631.54s)]
*  He's an actual person who is telling Americans every day what he plans to do if he retakes [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=635.78s)]
*  the White House. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=641.78s)]
*  And I think that's going to move the national consciousness into a very different space [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=642.78s)]
*  than it is right now. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=646.66s)]
*  Yeah, I want to just read from your piece, which I thought was very good. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=647.66s)]
*  You said, if the glut of attention 2016 desensitized the nation of Trump, the relative dearth in [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=650.14s)]
*  the past year has turned him into abstraction. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=655.14s)]
*  The major cable news networks don't take his speeches live like they used to, afraid they'll [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=657.3399999999999s)]
*  be accused of amplifying his lies. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=660.74s)]
*  He skipped every one of the GOP primary debates and since Twitter panned him in January 2021, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=662.94s)]
*  his daily fulminations have remained siloed in his own obscure social media network, Truth [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=667.82s)]
*  Social. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=672.7800000000001s)]
*  These days, Trump exists in many Americans minds as a hazy silhouette formed by preconceived [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=673.7800000000001s)]
*  notions and outdated impressions, rather as an actual person who's telling the country [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=678.5400000000001s)]
*  every day who he is and what he plans to do with the second term. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=682.44s)]
*  And to that point, I thought this this polling from economist YouGov, which is that 41 percent [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  of Americans don't think he's going to be the nominee and the Biden administration [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=692.02s)]
*  and the Biden campaign and their campaign research, they say three quarters of undecided [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=696.14s)]
*  voters. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=701.38s)]
*  So it's like not just I don't want to think about him anymore, but like, oh, it's that [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=702.38s)]
*  that guy again. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=705.62s)]
*  Like that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=706.78s)]
*  I don't think I really don't think that sunk in. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=708.9s)]
*  And I do think it's creating a bit of a bubble, particularly around the polling and sort of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=710.9399999999999s)]
*  expectations of his viability, how powerful a candidate is going to be. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=716.9s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=722.14s)]
*  I mean, his his strength exists among people who follow the you know, or is apparent to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=723.14s)]
*  people who follow the political news every day. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=729.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=731.9s)]
*  But I even encounter this in my daily life. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=732.9s)]
*  People will tell me, well, Donald Trump isn't really going to win the nomination again. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=734.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=738.38s)]
*  I mean, they have all these other people running. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=739.38s)]
*  Is it one of them going to win? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=740.38s)]
*  And what about all of his legal peril? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=741.58s)]
*  You know, is it is it one of these trials going to derail him? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=743.26s)]
*  And I don't think it's sunken in for Americans that he's going to be on their TV every day [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=746.2s)]
*  again. Right. He's they're going to be exposed to his, you know, daily musings and rants [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=751.7s)]
*  and grievances in a way that they haven't been in many years. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=758.46s)]
*  Now, look, I do want to avoid the inevitability narrative that the Trump campaign clearly [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=761.74s)]
*  wants to amplify. I don't think this race is over by a long shot. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=767.3000000000001s)]
*  I think he is clearly the favorite. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=771.22s)]
*  But, you know, one state has voted. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=772.86s)]
*  We're about to go to New Hampshire where he's not nearly as strong. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=775.22s)]
*  And then there, you know, there's a long race ahead of us. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=778.46s)]
*  So I want to be careful about that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=780.9399999999999s)]
*  But I do think that the more part, you know, the headline that we put on this piece that a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=783.06s)]
*  lot of people kind of reacted strongly to was that you should go to a Trump rally. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=788.3399999999999s)]
*  And my argument is. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=792.66s)]
*  Don't tell me what to do, McKay. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=793.66s)]
*  Look, I'm sorry. I understand that sounds deeply unpleasant to a lot of people. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=795.6999999999999s)]
*  And I know that some people will not take that take me up on that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=799.3s)]
*  But my point is, I think that the more you are, you know, I think going back to a rally, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=802.26s)]
*  seeing him in person and maybe it's just live streaming, but seeing watch a full speech of his, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=808.98s)]
*  right? Remind yourself what he's saying. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=814.02s)]
*  Remind yourself what he's about. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=817.42s)]
*  You might be surprised by some of the stuff that he's saying on the campaign trail. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=819.62s)]
*  You might also be surprised, as I was, by how weak he is as, you know, compared to 2016. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=823.58s)]
*  Even at this rally I went to in Mason City, these were Trump supporters. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=830.34s)]
*  These are people who liked him. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=833.7s)]
*  They were streaming out of the exits halfway through his, you know, he would go on these kind of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=835.3000000000001s)]
*  rambly rifts about his various trials and his own martyrdom and the election being stolen from him. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=840.26s)]
*  And people were clearly bored. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=846.14s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying that that one rally is a microcosm for the entire Republican electorate, but I [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=848.54s)]
*  don't think he has the same instinct for entertainment and for capturing and holding attention [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=853.46s)]
*  that he did in 2016. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=860.38s)]
*  And I think more people are going to realize that as this race continues this year. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=862.22s)]
*  Yeah, dick gets old. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=866.34s)]
*  McKay Coppins, thank you very much. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=867.98s)]
*  Thank you. Coming up, Nikki Haley lands in New Hampshire with a shot to win. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=870.22s)]
*  Ron DeSantis headed straight to South Carolina and Donald Trump. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=874.3s)]
*  Well, as I said today, he showed up in court for another defamation trial over the sexual assault he [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=877.42s)]
*  was found liable for last year by a jury. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=883.06s)]
*  Lisa Rubin had a front row seat for it all. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=885.86s)]
*  And she's going to join me right here next. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=887.78s)]
*  Donald Trump has made history in lots of ways, probably too many to count, but they include racking [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=890.14s)]
*  up an all time record of impeachments and indictments for a president or ex-president. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=896.58s)]
*  He is also, as far as I know, and at least in the modern era, come the closest of any president to [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=900.6999999999999s)]
*  being found guilty of sexual assault. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=905.58s)]
*  Last year, Trump was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming magazine writer E. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=908.74s)]
*  Jean Carroll. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=913.42s)]
*  Now, it was litigated in a civil trial. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=914.62s)]
*  She sued him. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=916.46s)]
*  Which is a lower standard of proof than a criminal proceeding. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=917.38s)]
*  But still, the jury deliberated on this. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=919.46s)]
*  They got evidence. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=922.06s)]
*  They found him liable. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=922.66s)]
*  And the details are horrific. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=924.22s)]
*  I think it has largely escaped penetrating the American consciousness because there's so much [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=925.98s)]
*  terrible stuff about him. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=930.46s)]
*  Carroll accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room in the Bergdorf-Gridman department store in [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=932.66s)]
*  Manhattan in the 1990s. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=938.02s)]
*  He called her a liar. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=939.9s)]
*  She sued him for defamation and she won. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=941.14s)]
*  The jury awarding her $5 million in damages last May. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=944.14s)]
*  Today, the day after his win in the Iowa caucus, the front runner for the Republican nomination [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=946.9s)]
*  was in court for the start of a second defamation trial over other instances of his dismissing [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=951.66s)]
*  Carroll's accusations as false. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=957.3399999999999s)]
*  The jury will be asked only to determine damages because, as the judge said in court today, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=959.8199999999999s)]
*  quote, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=963.6999999999999s)]
*  He knew when he made the statements about Ms. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=973.3s)]
*  Carroll, the statements are false, that he made them with reckless disregard. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=975.02s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Ruhman was inside that courtroom today and she joins me now. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=979.4599999999999s)]
*  It's so good to have you here. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=983.8199999999999s)]
*  So, first of all, do you have any sense of why he went to the trial today? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=985.9799999999999s)]
*  I was a little surprised. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=990.3s)]
*  So I think there are two reasons that he went. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=992.6999999999999s)]
*  One is a convergence of a legal and political strategy because Donald Trump seems to understand [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=994.3s)]
*  that his popularity rises in proportion to his playing the victim. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=999.62s)]
*  And here, rather than allow E.G. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1003.62s)]
*  Carroll to rope herself in the victimhood that she has, in fact, earned, he instead decided [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1005.86s)]
*  he would play the victim so that when he goes back to New Hampshire, he can say, oh, I was [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1010.78s)]
*  trapped in that courtroom all day. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1014.58s)]
*  I had to be there when I would so much rather be here with you. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1015.86s)]
*  But I think the other reason that he went was to make eye contact with as many of the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1018.98s)]
*  people who are either decision makers or accusers here as possible. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1023.9s)]
*  And just like at his arraignment in Florida last year, when he turned around, faced the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1028.3s)]
*  gallery and stared down a gallery full of press, including me, today, those stairs were [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1032.78s)]
*  reserved for the prospective jurors. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1038.3s)]
*  And it included not only looking at them as they answered the judge's questions, but also [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1040.18s)]
*  a lot of gesticulating. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1045.38s)]
*  For example, when Judge Kaplan asked, does anyone here believe President Trump has been [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1046.98s)]
*  treated unfairly by the justice system, two prospective jurors stood up. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1052.06s)]
*  But former President Trump also answered the question, even though it wasn't directed at [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1055.74s)]
*  him by going like this. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1059.98s)]
*  And he's looking at the jury. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1062.1s)]
*  He's trying to sort of manipulate the jury as much as he can. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1063.74s)]
*  Now, the legal posture of this case, I had to go back and remind myself of it today. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1066.74s)]
*  So remind us, obviously, there was a trial. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1070.54s)]
*  We covered that trial. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1073.3s)]
*  You covered that trial. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1074.42s)]
*  He was found liable in order to pay damages. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1075.26s)]
*  This is another trial. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1078.46s)]
*  What is the origin of this? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1080.02s)]
*  So the trial last spring was about statements that Trump had made in October of 2022 on [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1082.02s)]
*  the verge of a deposition in the case that's being tried right now. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1087.7s)]
*  After he was present. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1090.74s)]
*  Correct. And because he was no longer president, there was less legal wrangling about his [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1091.82s)]
*  liability. That case went to trial first. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1096.42s)]
*  Consider this trial about the book ends of defamation. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1098.7s)]
*  This is principally about two statements he made in June of 2019 when E.G. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1102.18s)]
*  Carroll first came forward and published an excerpt of her memoir, A New York Magazine. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1106.18s)]
*  But it's also from a punitive damages perspective about all the different times Trump has [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  repeated those defamatory statements since, including, as her lawyer Sean Crowley pointed [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1116.0200000000002s)]
*  out today, as many as 22 times just today in a truth storm as he was sitting in court. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1121.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he has been again. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1128.5s)]
*  This is this sort of connects to what I was saying in the first. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1129.9s)]
*  I mean, the way that he has talked about her on Truth Social is so despicable, so disgusting, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1132.3000000000002s)]
*  so beyond the pale. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1137.9s)]
*  And so unrepentant. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1139.14s)]
*  Right. Yes, right. Exactly. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1140.46s)]
*  I mean, it's really. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1141.9s)]
*  Yes. And one of the things I think Sean did really effectively today in her opening was [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1142.94s)]
*  ask the jury not to consider a specific monetary number and punitive damages, but to think [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1147.5s)]
*  about how to make that award significant, very significant. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1153.14s)]
*  And she said, I want you to think about this. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1157.3400000000001s)]
*  How much will it cost to make him stop? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1160.38s)]
*  And then paused and said, after all, this is a man who's a self professed billionaire. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1164.8200000000002s)]
*  So when we talk about the quantum of damages here, even though E. Jean's team is not talking [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1170.14s)]
*  about specific monetary amounts, I think what they are aiming for is something that really [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1175.22s)]
*  feels like a punch in the gut to former President Trump and causes him to think twice about [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1180.26s)]
*  continuing to do what he has done even as recently as this morning. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1185.02s)]
*  Right. And what he has been found civilly liable for doing and is causing damage. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1188.46s)]
*  Damage, we should mention again over and above the sexual assault that he was found liable [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1193.54s)]
*  for by a civil jury. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1199.94s)]
*  And this trial isn't about the sexual assault. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1201.26s)]
*  In fact, the jurors have to presume that that sexual assault happened, that it is true, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1203.06s)]
*  that it was proven. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1207.6200000000001s)]
*  There was so Trump's lawyer also made her case today or opening arguments. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1208.98s)]
*  What I read of it again, gross. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1214.78s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1216.58s)]
*  Anyway, it was gross. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1218.42s)]
*  There was an interesting exchange between her and Judge Kaplan that I thought of you, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1221.3799999999999s)]
*  because the last time you were sitting at this table, we were talking about lessons [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1225.3s)]
*  from the civil trial in New York of Judge Ingeron and how to deal with Trump lawyers [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1228.78s)]
*  and how to deal with Trump. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1234.58s)]
*  And one of the things you and I discussed was no has got to mean no. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1235.86s)]
*  You can't let them to keep litigating things. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1239.4599999999998s)]
*  And Kaplan said something in court today almost literally like it was he had watched our segment [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1241.34s)]
*  when she tried to push on something. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1246.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'd like to take credit for Kaplan watching our segment where we talked [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1249.5s)]
*  about sort of the vending machine theory of parenting and how it applies to judging. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1252.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1256.78s)]
*  You put a quarter in and you get something out, you're going to keep doing it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1257.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1259.9s)]
*  Kaplan has always been that person. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1260.9s)]
*  And I think you could have a dozen former federal prosecutors from New York come on [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1261.9s)]
*  your show and tell you he has always been very tough on litigants. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1265.74s)]
*  And when he says no, he's always meant to know. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1270.82s)]
*  The question was, was that the Lou Kaplan that was going to show up at this court, particularly [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1273.14s)]
*  with Donald Trump in front of him? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1276.9s)]
*  And indeed today it was. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1278.6599999999999s)]
*  And I hope it remains so. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1279.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he said, Ms. Saba, that when I say when I issue a ruling, it is the end of discussion, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1280.8999999999999s)]
*  not the beginning of an argument, which I thought was a very clear message about how [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1286.3799999999999s)]
*  he wants us to go. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1291.7399999999998s)]
*  There's going to be another day in court tomorrow. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1292.9399999999998s)]
*  And we're expecting the former president to be there as well. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1296.1s)]
*  And Eugene Carroll will be in that courtroom. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1298.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1300.3799999999999s)]
*  And instead of staring at the back of her head, which was the only glimpse he got of [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1301.3799999999999s)]
*  her today, he's really hoping to stare down the barrel of the courtroom right into her [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1303.8999999999999s)]
*  eyes, something no person who's been victimized by Donald Trump should have to face. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1308.18s)]
*  Truly despicable. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1312.26s)]
*  All around, all of it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1315.5800000000002s)]
*  Lisa Ruth, thank you very much. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1316.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1318.14s)]
*  Still to come, Iowa Republicans put the party's longstanding concerns with election [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1320.18s)]
*  security to the ultimate test. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1324.3400000000001s)]
*  Casting ballots and popcorn buckets. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1326.6200000000001s)]
*  That's next. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1328.54s)]
*  The Iowa caucuses have this hold on the imagination of the nation's political reporting class [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1329.18s)]
*  because it's an open, frequently messy experiment. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1342.54s)]
*  Democracy, not to mention for TV networks, you can actually point a camera at what's [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1345.02s)]
*  going on. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1348.7s)]
*  After the Democratic Party's debacle of 2020, where there were delays in the count, the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1350.54s)]
*  top vote getter won fewer delegates, Democrats have just gotten rid of the whole thing. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1354.5s)]
*  They're just going to have normal mail-in voting, which honestly seems smart. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1358.38s)]
*  Not many people are up for joining the gaggle in this specific hour of the night, even when [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1362.8600000000001s)]
*  it isn't snowy and below freezing. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1367.5s)]
*  But the Republicans have kept their caucuses, and there's a cheery civic informality to [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1370.42s)]
*  it all. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1374.9s)]
*  Even though it's not an official election run by the state, it's a party function. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1376.18s)]
*  It's being run by the local Republican Party. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1379.5400000000002s)]
*  There's something downright Rockwellian about this scene. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1382.9s)]
*  You've got people trudging out in the snow, and they all get in the room together, and [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1386.02s)]
*  they talk, and they argue, and they consider the issues and the candidates. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1389.74s)]
*  And then they caucus like this. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1393.18s)]
*  This is the voting method. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1395.76s)]
*  They are putting votes into a brown paper bag, passing it around, just stuff it in there, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1397.26s)]
*  keep it moving. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1402.86s)]
*  Don't like grocery bags? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1403.86s)]
*  Maybe prefer popcorn buckets. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1405.5s)]
*  DeSantis. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1408.5s)]
*  Haley. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1411.78s)]
*  Trump. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1415.14s)]
*  That's it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1416.62s)]
*  If that's not enough transparency for you, try this gathering, where they walk the aisles [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1421.1s)]
*  to grab ballots and stuff fistfuls of votes into clear, ziplock bags. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1425.18s)]
*  Can't get more transparent than plastic bags. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1430.42s)]
*  Now, to be clear, I don't personally have an issue with any of this. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1432.42s)]
*  I do not think people are going to abuse the grocery bags and the popcorn buckets in the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1435.3s)]
*  system. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1440.26s)]
*  But our friend, Elie Mestal, makes an interesting observation. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1441.26s)]
*  He posts, this is what voting looks like when white people know only white people will be [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1444.98s)]
*  allowed to cast ballots. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1449.34s)]
*  Just grab them and count them. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1451.94s)]
*  Just stuff them in. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1453.62s)]
*  There you go. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1454.8999999999999s)]
*  Pass it on. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1455.8999999999999s)]
*  Watching this as the means of counting the votes and ballot security in the internal [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1456.8999999999999s)]
*  world of Republican politics is really mind-blowing when you think for a second about the context [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1461.5s)]
*  here, right? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1467.22s)]
*  I mean, two-thirds of caucusgoers believe that Joe Biden is not the legitimately elected [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1468.22s)]
*  president. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1474.06s)]
*  Four years of the big lie and the constant, disgustingly racist drumbeat about Democrats [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1476.02s)]
*  stealing the election. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1480.8200000000002s)]
*  Remember, after the 2020 vote in Detroit when pro-Trump influencers passed around viral [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1482.26s)]
*  video of a wagon supposedly containing extra ballots being brought into the tabulation [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1487.98s)]
*  room? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1492.42s)]
*  Who is actually a news photographer carting his equipment in. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1493.42s)]
*  But that didn't stop a white MAGA mob from pounding the glass and trying to force their [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1496.98s)]
*  way in and chanting, stop the count. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1502.74s)]
*  A scene like that was replicated in places like Milwaukee and Philadelphia and Atlanta, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1506.22s)]
*  where Trump supporters launched personal attacks and threats against two black poll workers [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1511.82s)]
*  doing their civic duty. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1516.34s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and Shea Freeman-Morris and one other gentleman quite obviously surreptitiously [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1519.06s)]
*  passing around USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or cocaine. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1524.6599999999999s)]
*  What was your mom actually handing you on that video? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1530.26s)]
*  A ginger mint. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1533.7s)]
*  Remember how Democrats and volunteers of color could not be trusted to collect and count [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1536.3s)]
*  votes, that they were stealing, that they were part of a conspiracy? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1540.06s)]
*  Just keep that in mind as you watch this alternative universe in Iowa in which Republicans gather [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1544.62s)]
*  an incredibly homogenous population of folks and in this context, yeah, perfectly fine [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1549.8999999999999s)]
*  passing a paper bag around to stuff it with votes. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1554.78s)]
*  Can you imagine what they would have done with that video if the bag were in the hands [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1559.22s)]
*  of Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss or poll workers in Detroit? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1564.54s)]
*  The point isn't about ballot security, it's not about the process that votes are counted, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1568.26s)]
*  it's not about mail-in balloting. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1573.86s)]
*  No, for Republicans, for Trump, to cry voting integrity is virtue signaling. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1575.2199999999998s)]
*  It signals who they think should control elections and which people they think are really worthy [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1580.62s)]
*  of representation. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1586.9399999999998s)]
*  The pundits will analyze the results from every angle. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1593.06s)]
*  We get that. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1597.2199999999998s)]
*  But when you look at how we're doing in New Hampshire, in South Carolina, and beyond, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1599.18s)]
*  I can safely say tonight, Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1611.02s)]
*  Nikki Haley said there is kind of true. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1626.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, in the sense that if she stands any chance in this presidential primary, it has [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1628.5800000000002s)]
*  to be a two-person race between her and Donald Trump. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1632.5400000000002s)]
*  And Ron DeSantis doesn't really have a path after last night. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1635.38s)]
*  But the fact that he eked out a second-place finish in Iowa means he will still, nonetheless, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1639.3400000000001s)]
*  probably stick around for a while, which ultimately helps Trump. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1643.8600000000001s)]
*  Aware of that fact, Haley says she will not be doing another debate unless it's against [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1647.5800000000002s)]
*  Trump or Biden. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1651.74s)]
*  That means that the scheduled primary debate in New Hampshire this Thursday is now canceled. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1653.6200000000001s)]
*  It remains an open question whether Haley can get the competition down to a two-person [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1657.78s)]
*  race and whether she has any path at all to the nomination. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1662.06s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic pollster and strategist Cornell Belcher. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1666.8999999999999s)]
*  Cornell, what do you think about Haley's performance, her message, and what the entrance polling [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1670.1s)]
*  and the results last night and the polling in New Hampshire tells us about her viability? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1676.62s)]
*  Well, Chris, you're a political nerd like I am, so you might remember this. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1680.3799999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of you as well. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1684.86s)]
*  Do you remember Joe Momentum? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1686.38s)]
*  Joe Momentum? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1688.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1689.22s)]
*  Yeah, Joe Momentum. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1690.22s)]
*  He came in third or fourth, and he said he had real Joe Momentum. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1691.22s)]
*  I kind of feel as though she's pulling a Joe Momentum here. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1696.5s)]
*  Chris, she had an opportunity to actually make it a two-person race because I have been [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1701.14s)]
*  saying on MSNBC's air and NBC's air for the last two weeks now that DeSantis went all [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1705.7800000000002s)]
*  in on Iowa. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1713.5800000000002s)]
*  No one spent more money from the campaign, the PAC side. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1715.82s)]
*  No one put my bigger investment in Iowa than he did. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1719.5s)]
*  If she could have beaten him in Iowa, if she could have in fact pushed him to third place [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1724.4599999999998s)]
*  and had a solid second place finish in Iowa, I think she would have killed him off. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1729.9799999999998s)]
*  She failed to kill him off. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1735.82s)]
*  I think it was a real strategic missed opportunity on their part to make it a two-person race. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1737.4599999999998s)]
*  Now, that said, Chris, I know people keep saying, well, when it becomes a two-person [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1744.1s)]
*  race or when the field narrows down, they can reach Trump. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1751.54s)]
*  I don't think that data necessarily points to that right now because there is this thing [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1758.5s)]
*  called second choice because even when you look at the second choice of DeSantis voters [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1762.22s)]
*  or Haley voters right now, it's not like 99% of DeSantis voters are breaking for Haley [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1767.66s)]
*  if DeSantis is not there. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1774.66s)]
*  It is still, when you look at the second choice, Trump still gets a large swath of the second [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1777.7s)]
*  choice votes of both Haley as well as DeSantis. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1782.78s)]
*  I still don't buy that there is an anti-Trump lane. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1786.74s)]
*  I think Iowa went a long way in telling me there's not an anti-Trump lane to victory [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1791.5s)]
*  I think there's an anti-Trump off-road, but her leaning so much in this anti-Trump lane [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1797.3s)]
*  in the Republican Party right now, I don't think the data backs it up. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1803.58s)]
*  Well, here's what she's trying to do. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1808.06s)]
*  I thought it was interesting. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1809.8999999999999s)]
*  This is only probably a little bit of what she was on today talking, and this is basically [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1810.8999999999999s)]
*  what she was doing in the speech last night. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1815.34s)]
*  She was trying to do this Trump-Biden of the same thing that they're both. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1816.82s)]
*  It's a way of kind of going at Trump but not like somewhat obliquely and also going after [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1822.82s)]
*  Biden which obviously is, you know, for Republicans they like to hear that. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1826.6599999999999s)]
*  And basically it kind of turned the page. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1830.8999999999999s)]
*  People don't want this again. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1832.6599999999999s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1833.6599999999999s)]
*  75% of Americans don't want a Trump-Biden rematch. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1834.6599999999999s)]
*  The majority of Americans don't want either one of them. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1839.86s)]
*  Are we really at the point that we're going to put two 80-year-olds as our options? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1843.9399999999998s)]
*  While we're trying to move forward with issues that matter on inflation and education and [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1848.1s)]
*  border and law and order and these wars around the world, what are they talking about? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1851.94s)]
*  They're having to deal with investigations. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1857.9s)]
*  They're talking about the past. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1859.5s)]
*  They're not moving forward and they're not showing a vision. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1860.94s)]
*  I don't think that's at all an honest or accurate assessment, but just to be clear, they're [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1863.94s)]
*  having to talk about the investigations like they're talking about the past. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1869.42s)]
*  One of the two people really talks about the past. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1873.66s)]
*  One doesn't. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1875.6200000000001s)]
*  But what do you think of that as an attempt to kind of do this impossible, thread this [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1876.9399999999998s)]
*  needle which is running against Trump in a way that will be palatable to voters in the [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1881.6999999999998s)]
*  Republican primary? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1886.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1887.58s)]
*  You know, I'm going to steal a line from DeSantis here. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1888.58s)]
*  It is, you know, she's looking for non-Republicans to give her the Republican nomination. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1890.86s)]
*  And I think that's a great message for a general election audience if you're running third [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1896.4199999999998s)]
*  party in the general election audience. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1901.2199999999998s)]
*  But if you're running in a Republican primary and you have to win Republican votes, where [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1903.1s)]
*  and let's be clear, he's not the incumbent, but in many ways Donald Trump is the incumbent. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1908.78s)]
*  And look, and I watched you all last night and talking about sort of how he was doing. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1912.6999999999998s)]
*  And I wasn't surprised by how he was doing because he actually is sort of the incumbent [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1916.86s)]
*  and incumbents tend to win elections. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1920.9399999999998s)]
*  Look, most of these voters have in fact voted for him at least twice. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1922.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1928.2199999999998s)]
*  So you actually have to give them a credible reason to fire this person that they like [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1929.46s)]
*  and all the polling shows that the vast majority of the Republican primary voters, they really [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1934.82s)]
*  like Donald Trump. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1939.8600000000001s)]
*  They have not turned against Donald Trump. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1940.98s)]
*  So I think it's problematic that she is turning to sort of a broad sort of general election [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1943.02s)]
*  on messaging the winner primary voters. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1949.58s)]
*  And I think it speaks to how, and by the way, Chris, this sounds a little bit like what [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1952.9s)]
*  DeSantis was trying early on in the campaign season when he was trying to get sort of say, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1957.78s)]
*  Donald Trump's a nice enough guy, but he's got all these problems and never win any. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1962.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1967.8200000000002s)]
*  It's a tough, it's a tough assignment for all of them. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1968.8200000000002s)]
*  Better than the name. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1973.5400000000002s)]
*  Cornell Belcher, thank you very much. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1974.5400000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1975.8200000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1976.8200000000002s)]
*  Still ahead, Nikki Haley says she's the right candidate to beat President Biden, but there [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1977.8200000000002s)]
*  are, are there enough Republican voters willing to listen to that argument? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1981.6200000000001s)]
*  What's next? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1985.46s)]
*  So last night, Nikki Haley made a case in that speech she gave at the end of the evening [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1987.66s)]
*  for why she would be the best person to take on Joe Biden and also would win a big congressional [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=1998.8600000000001s)]
*  majority that would give Republicans real power to govern. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2004.26s)]
*  The thing is, the polling we have shows Republican voters aren't thinking really in these sort [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2007.9s)]
*  of electability terms. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2012.26s)]
*  Leading Biden mattered most to a mere 14% of Iowa caucus goers. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2014.86s)]
*  Part of that is because Joe Biden is depicted in Republican media and conservative media [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2020.4199999999998s)]
*  as just a ludicrously weak candidate. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2024.7199999999998s)]
*  Anyone could beat him. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2027.62s)]
*  And also many believe, of course, two thirds that Donald Trump did beat Biden already, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2029.1799999999998s)]
*  even though that's patently false. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2033.1399999999999s)]
*  That said, head-to-head polling shows Donald Trump tying or leading Biden already, like [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2035.1s)]
*  in poll after poll, which helps Trump, I think, make his argument. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2039.26s)]
*  And also causing a lot of consternation among Democrats who, again, don't have an active [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2045.06s)]
*  primary going on as a place to sort of channel that anxiety. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2049.08s)]
*  Two people extremely familiar with this are David Plouffe, who served as campaign manager [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2054.1s)]
*  to President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and subsequently senior advisor to the president, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2058.18s)]
*  Jim Palmieri, who served as communications director for President Barack Obama and Hillary [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2062.86s)]
*  Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign against Donald Trump. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2066.86s)]
*  They both joined me. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2070.2599999999998s)]
*  I was struck by that electability number because I know from the perspective of Democratic [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2072.54s)]
*  voters, when it's a Democratic party that's on the out. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2079.94s)]
*  So I think about the primary in 04 against W. Bush and the primary in 2020, that 14 number [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2082.82s)]
*  is like 65. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2088.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2089.98s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2090.98s)]
*  I feel like that is the thing. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2091.98s)]
*  That's every discussion is who's going to be the person to beat George W. Bush, who's [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2093.66s)]
*  going to be the person to beat Trump. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2098.18s)]
*  And Democratic voters decided in 2017 that person was Joe Biden and they never wavered [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2100.94s)]
*  from that. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2106.2999999999997s)]
*  You're saying in that polling. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2107.2999999999997s)]
*  In that polling. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2108.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2109.2999999999997s)]
*  And national polling. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2110.2999999999997s)]
*  Even as Biden lost in Iowa and New Hampshire, he still led the national poll. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2111.2999999999997s)]
*  We always say we don't have national primaries, we kind of have national primaries now. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2115.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I think that what I've experienced in talking with Trump voters is that it's [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2119.7s)]
*  just a much deeper thing for them. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2126.06s)]
*  It's about vindication, retribution, revenge for their guy who gets their life so clearly. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2129.3s)]
*  And electability is like two-step. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2137.0600000000004s)]
*  It's like a meta. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2139.54s)]
*  And it's also they think he won before. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2141.7000000000003s)]
*  So it's like the game's all rigged. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2143.94s)]
*  So there was like all these layers before you get to electability. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2145.54s)]
*  Plus, Trump was beating Biden in a lot of polls. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2147.78s)]
*  So they think he is the guy. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2150.76s)]
*  I think that polling has helped him enormously. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2153.98s)]
*  I honestly think if the polling right now had him losing poll after poll, even though [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2156.9s)]
*  people say not electability, it's like you can have your cake and eat it too. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2161.9s)]
*  I like Trump, but I might be worried he won't perform well, but he's performing well. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2165.1400000000003s)]
*  No question. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2168.42s)]
*  I mean, it's threefold. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2169.42s)]
*  It's that there's polls Trump can point to, even though he's weaker than Haley. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2170.42s)]
*  Two, they're told every day Biden can barely get out of bed. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2173.38s)]
*  So of course anybody can beat him. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2178.1400000000003s)]
*  And three, we have a legitimate rematch. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2179.5800000000004s)]
*  But I think what's interesting, I'm sure the timing won't align like this, but let's say [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2182.2200000000003s)]
*  Haley does win next Tuesday. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2185.74s)]
*  And let's say there's polls that show her four to six points maybe better than Trump. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2188.22s)]
*  Trump doesn't handle losing particularly well. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2192.8999999999996s)]
*  There may be something to that going forward, at least in the states where it's an open [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2194.8999999999996s)]
*  primary. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2199.8199999999997s)]
*  I think in closed primaries, it's hard to see where Haley gets to 50. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2200.8199999999997s)]
*  In a two way, maybe she gets to 45, but a lot of those are winner take all delegate [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2203.66s)]
*  states. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2207.2599999999998s)]
*  The thing I keep coming back to because I've come up through left, center left, liberal [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2208.2599999999998s)]
*  politics, progressive politics, it's just how much more like neurotic and hand wringing [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2213.94s)]
*  and sort of like self doubting this process and conversations are in those circles that [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2220.3799999999997s)]
*  they appear to be. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2226.74s)]
*  I mean, I keep saying this, like, can you imagine Jen, if the Democratic nominee had [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2227.74s)]
*  91 felony counts, he wasn't facing like, can you imagine? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2231.3799999999997s)]
*  That person would be out. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2237.94s)]
*  They would not be. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2238.94s)]
*  They would of course not be the nominee. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2239.94s)]
*  They would not be. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2240.94s)]
*  So if Joe Biden as the incumbent president only won Iowa by 50% and that there were only [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2241.94s)]
*  100,000 people turned out, that would be the focus the next morning for Democrats. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2250.3s)]
*  And Trump is sort of the incumbent. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2257.66s)]
*  We are just built differently. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2261.46s)]
*  Democrats are built so that we worry a lot and we always see the classes almost half [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2263.26s)]
*  I also think that that concern is why the public is still standing. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2267.7000000000003s)]
*  So I totally agree. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2273.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like this weird... [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2274.2200000000003s)]
*  In some ways it's okay. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  It's okay to be nervous and, you know, and like, you know, what if I for all it says, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2276.2200000000003s)]
*  don't, you know, like never panic, but just like worry and stay focused. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2281.46s)]
*  Well, and also 2016, right? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2285.6600000000003s)]
*  The trauma, the seminal trauma. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2287.7400000000002s)]
*  They're never going to recover from that. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2290.1400000000003s)]
*  But I think that 100,000 only, you know, we're talking about 100,000 people. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2293.26s)]
*  I'm not sure that Trump really in the real in real terms got a ton more votes last night [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2298.1800000000003s)]
*  than he got in 2016 in Iowa. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2302.7000000000003s)]
*  It was just like a smaller. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2304.86s)]
*  So it's still a pretty feeble Republican Party. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2306.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think just as much as Trump talks about grievances and reflecting that in people's [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2310.46s)]
*  lives, like Biden needs to be reflecting the success that people feel in their lives. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2315.2200000000003s)]
*  Like embrace that optimism. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2319.74s)]
*  And I think also, so Trump, it's not like he's beat the hall of fame of, you know, opponents [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2323.98s)]
*  last night. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2330.14s)]
*  I mean, actually the field in 16 was stronger. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2331.14s)]
*  And I do think your point's interesting. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2334.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to say all Democrats, a lot of Democrats. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2336.2999999999997s)]
*  We act sometimes like the Republicans are the master strategists of all time. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2338.98s)]
*  They never lose elections. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2342.8599999999997s)]
*  They lose elections all the time. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2344.18s)]
*  They should have won the Senate like four times in the last 12 years. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2345.18s)]
*  They've lost the presidency more than they've won it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2349.02s)]
*  So there are a couple of numbers out of last night that I think are interesting. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2350.78s)]
*  Now, obviously, Biden did pretty well with with with sort of left sort of center right [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2353.46s)]
*  independence in 20 and did well enough with Republicans. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2358.26s)]
*  Eleven percent of Iowa Cox attenders said they would not vote for Donald Trump. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2362.3s)]
*  OK, and about a third of people said if he got convicted, it would bother them. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2368.22s)]
*  Now, we can rule that two thirds said they wouldn't know. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2371.54s)]
*  But that's a big. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2374.38s)]
*  So that's politics is about a lot of things. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2375.38s)]
*  It's it's at the core. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2378.18s)]
*  How many votes do you need to win? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2379.5s)]
*  And that produces really interesting data and targets, the types of people [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2381.1s)]
*  maybe Biden could add a half percent or percent as Republican number. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2386.42s)]
*  And that's how he wins. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2390.18s)]
*  Can I ask you about the age thing with with Biden? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2391.62s)]
*  Because, you know, it's funny, Haley, just saying, you know, do we want to [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2394.22s)]
*  80 year olds? And I think, you know, it strikes me as a as a very useful line of [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2396.7s)]
*  attack because there's it's not it's non rebuttable. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2401.54s)]
*  Right. Right. Like Biden can't make it go away. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2405.86s)]
*  He can't. Right. You can't. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2408.26s)]
*  Like it is just a fact about the world. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2409.38s)]
*  And also, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, the way that time works is that you [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2411.78s)]
*  can't reverse it. Right. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2416.6600000000003s)]
*  Like you can't flip flop on it. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2417.7000000000003s)]
*  You can't be like, well, I'm attacking to the center on my age. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2419.46s)]
*  You know, it is what it is. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2422.02s)]
*  I wonder like what you do with that if you're the campaign, because it really is. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  It shows up in the polling. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2427.7400000000002s)]
*  It shows up in conversations. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2429.42s)]
*  And it's also not insane. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2430.86s)]
*  Like he is older than it. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2432.3s)]
*  It's a legit question. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2434.42s)]
*  The White House says all the time it's a legit question. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2435.6600000000003s)]
*  So I think that you have to I think you have to embrace, you know, and the first [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2437.42s)]
*  lady talked about this, I think you have to embrace his experience and his age as [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2440.86s)]
*  equating with wisdom that we need somebody with this kind of experience now. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2444.06s)]
*  I think we need to see him more often. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2448.02s)]
*  So we are used to what he looks and sounds like, because if you know, if you [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2450.6600000000003s)]
*  don't see him a lot, then it can be jarring. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2456.2200000000003s)]
*  So I think, you know, just and we and that's a very interesting. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2459.5s)]
*  I really think I think that's really important. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2464.02s)]
*  So you're just used to how he how he looks and sounds. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2466.7s)]
*  And, you know, you know, George Washington did this when he when when he was facing [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2470.78s)]
*  rebellion from his own troops because they weren't getting paid. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2474.9s)]
*  And he gave a speech and he put on his glasses and he's like, I have to put on [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2476.9s)]
*  my spectacles because my eyes have grown weary in service of the country. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2479.82s)]
*  And then I was like, embrace that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2483.18s)]
*  And you know, the way FDR did, you see how much you're aging me. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2486.62s)]
*  How much you see America, how much I agree. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2489.82s)]
*  You know, and last night he did. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2491.7s)]
*  I have David never talked about this. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2493.22s)]
*  I have noticed that they've been doing a lot of videos. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2494.62s)]
*  They did one after Trump's town hall last week. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2498.14s)]
*  They did one today about, you know, I'm what it's I'm the only guy who's [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2500.9399999999996s)]
*  beaten Donald Trump. I'm ready to do it again. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2504.3399999999997s)]
*  I think we need to like see all that be very comfortable, be very used to what he [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2507.2999999999997s)]
*  looks in different mediums. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2512.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And and but I agree that the other thing is I just think you embrace it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2513.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Like, let's say a announcement speech. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2518.8999999999996s)]
*  America is faced with a choice between two old white men and meet people where [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2521.3799999999997s)]
*  they are and say, I get a lot of people aren't excited about that. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2526.74s)]
*  But that's the only similarity mean this other guy has David Pluff, Jim Palmieri. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2530.14s)]
*  Great to have you both. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN9eAAy7LUc&t=2533.74s)]
