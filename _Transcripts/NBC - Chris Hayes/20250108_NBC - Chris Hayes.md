# Hayes The trans population is far smaller than the right would have you believe
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM)
*  You could not watch a single NFL football game all election season without seeing a barrage of ads. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, constant about the scourge of trans people and their alleged domination of American culture thanks to Kamala Harris. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=7.0s)]
*  Republicans have now run multiple campaigns in congressional, statewide, presidential, playing up fear of, for instance, trans women playing sports [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=13.0s)]
*  and trans youth seeking medical procedures with their parents' consent, obviously, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=22.0s)]
*  or simply seeking to use a public restroom and privacy and dignity. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=27.0s)]
*  And given all this, I mean, given how much emphasis there has been on this, I think it's worth asking, what is the scale of the issue we are talking about? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=30.0s)]
*  Why are we talking about it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=38.0s)]
*  Republicans don't have an answer. Take West Virginia Senator Jim Justice in 2021 as his state's governor. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=40.0s)]
*  He signed a ban on trans students in school sports, but he couldn't tell Stephanie Rule that it solved any real world problem. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=46.0s)]
*  Can you name one example of a transgender child trying to gain an unfair competitive advantage at a school there in West Virginia? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=52.0s)]
*  Well, Stephanie, I don't have that experience exactly to myself right now, but I will tell you this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=61.0s)]
*  Not yourself, your state, sir. Can you give me one example of a transgender child trying to get an unfair advantage, just one in your state? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=69.0s)]
*  You signed a bill about it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=77.0s)]
*  No, I can't really tell you one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=79.0s)]
*  This Republican moral panic has given most Americans a wildly incorrect notion of the scale of just trans life in America. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=82.0s)]
*  So in 2022, YouGov polled a thousand Americans, found they really tend to vastly overestimate the size of basically every minority group, including the proportion of people who are transgender. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=90.0s)]
*  Respondents guessed more than a fifth of the country was trans. The true estimate is 0.6 percent. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=100.0s)]
*  Oh, but they're taking over women's and girls sports. Another just lie. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=107.0s)]
*  As the head of the NCAA told the Senate last month. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=112.0s)]
*  How many athletes are there in the United States and NCAA schools? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=117.0s)]
*  Five hundred and ten thousand. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=123.0s)]
*  How many transgender athletes are you aware of? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=126.0s)]
*  Less than ten. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=131.0s)]
*  Less than ten. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=133.0s)]
*  Five hundred and ten thousand. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=135.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=137.0s)]
*  Well, that's the ten. In other words, less than two thousandths of a percent of college athletes are trans. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=138.0s)]
*  But thousands of American children are being brainwashed and altered with puberty blockers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=145.0s)]
*  Also, just not true. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=149.0s)]
*  We've got a new peer reviewed study looked at more than five million health insurance claims by adolescents. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=151.0s)]
*  As one study organizer told NPR this week, there were less than one thousand youth that accessed puberty blockers and less than two thousand that ever had access to hormones. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=157.0s)]
*  In other words, less than one tenth of one percent of teenagers with private insurance in the US are transgender and receive gender related medicine. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=167.0s)]
*  Here is what is true. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=178.0s)]
*  There are far, far fewer transgender Americans in the far right wants you to think there are. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=180.0s)]
*  They want you to think the numbers are inflated because they need the fuel of real actual human beings to be fed into the engine of their cynical culture wars. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=185.0s)]
*  The more Republicans obscure that truth, the more damage they do to a deeper truth. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=194.0s)]
*  No matter their numbers, every transgender person is as worthy as anyone else of dignity and respect and equal rights under the law. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=200.0s)]
*  You [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBLBk-WEfPM&t=214.0s)]
