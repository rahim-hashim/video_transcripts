# Trump spiritual advisor admits to sexually abusing 12-year-old girl
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M)
*  One of the ways Donald Trump won the 2016 election was through the complete embrace [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=0.0s)]
*  of him by evangelicals, both the base and pastors and leaders in that movement. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=3.92s)]
*  One of the most prominent is a pastor named Robert Morris. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=8.56s)]
*  He founded a Texas megachurch in South Lake, Texas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Morris was also a spiritual adviser to Trump while he was in the White House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=15.8s)]
*  Here he is in the Rose Garden in 2020, just a few rows behind where then Supreme Court [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=19.52s)]
*  nominee Amy Coney Barrett's family and the First Lady are about to sit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=24.28s)]
*  And here is Trump visiting Morris's church earlier that summer, giving his personal assessment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=29.66s)]
*  of the man. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=34.86s)]
*  I want to thank pastors Robert Morris and Steve Dullen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=35.86s)]
*  They're great people. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=40.18s)]
*  Great people with a great reputation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=41.18s)]
*  I have to say they're great reputation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=42.18s)]
*  And Gateway Church, the team has been incredible in hosting us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=48.22s)]
*  And I'd now like to ask Pastor Morris and Bishop Jackson to lead us in prayer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=52.06s)]
*  Pastor Robert Morris just resigned from his church following allegations that he sexually [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=58.98s)]
*  abused a child. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=64.97999999999999s)]
*  In a statement to an evangelical news site, Morris said he was involved in an inappropriate [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=66.62s)]
*  sexual behavior with a young lady. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=72.42s)]
*  Those are his words. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=75.78s)]
*  He didn't mention that the young lady in question was a 12-year-old girl. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=77.36s)]
*  In his statement, Trump's one-time spiritual adviser admitted he continued to molest the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=84.32s)]
*  child on, quote, several occasions over the next few years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=88.14s)]
*  Mike Hixenbaugh, as a senior investigative reporter for NBC News, who's been all over [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=92.74s)]
*  the story, he writes about Pastor Morris in his book, They Came for the Schools, One Town's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=96.34s)]
*  Fight Over Race and Identity and the New War for America's Classrooms. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=101.26s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=105.02s)]
*  Mike, this is something that happened a long time ago that we are learning about now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=107.02s)]
*  Take us through how this came out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=112.66s)]
*  Well, last week, the survivor in this case, Cindy Klemenshire, who has tried telling the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=115.82s)]
*  story in different ways for years, came forward in a blog post and spelled out in very clear [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=122.38s)]
*  detail how, when she was 12 years old on Christmas in 1982, Pastor Morris, who was a family friend [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=128.22s)]
*  then, a young traveling evangelist, invited her into his room, the guest room at her house, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=136.18s)]
*  and proceeded to molest her, the first of several instances where he would do that over [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=143.46s)]
*  the next four and a half years. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=147.9s)]
*  And as you mentioned in the lead-in, Pastor Morris and Gateway Church responded initially [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=150.34s)]
*  by saying, this is an old sin. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=154.74s)]
*  Pastor Morris has addressed this moral failure of this relationship with a young lady, and, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=158.02s)]
*  you know, he's repented and this has been taken care of. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=164.74s)]
*  Flash forward a few days. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=167.78s)]
*  There was a lot of pressure around this when people started pointing out, yeah, the young [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=168.78s)]
*  lady was 12, that's a child, and yesterday he resigned from the church that he founded [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=172.46s)]
*  20-plus years ago. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=178.74s)]
*  Now, he had been telling a sort of story about a kind of redemption arc, about stepping away [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=180.22s)]
*  from the ministry in the 1980s because he had been confronted by the then-girl's father [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=185.18s)]
*  at that time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=192.38s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=193.38s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=194.94s)]
*  And I've been talking with former Gateway members and former pastors at the church. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=195.94s)]
*  They talk about how he talked about this story all the time, and it became kind of like a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  signature part of his biography that he had this moral failing when he was young, and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=205.62s)]
*  it was around sexual immorality with, again, a young lady. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=211.46s)]
*  In some tellings, he would describe himself almost as a victim, saying that the young [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=215.58s)]
*  lady had a Jezebel spirit and had tempted him, and in fact, that she's the one that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  made it continue. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=228.5s)]
*  He tried to stop it, and she made it continue. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=229.9s)]
*  So he tells these stories as a way of saying, you should be open about your sin and come [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=233.26s)]
*  forward, but in reality, we now know he was covering and papering over the reality of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=237.02s)]
*  child sexual abuse, which is a crime. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=243.98s)]
*  He also has been quite a prominent member of the evangelical movement, politically influential. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=248.38s)]
*  There are obviously many evangelical pastors, thousands, probably tens of thousands in this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=255.9s)]
*  country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  This is a particularly connected and powerful individual. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=264.22s)]
*  Yes, Trump's spiritual advisor, he's really leaned into the idea of advocating for a restoration [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=265.22s)]
*  of Christian morality in America through Republican politics. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=274.06s)]
*  And so you see that with him inviting Glenn Beck to speak from the pulpit at his church [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=277.18s)]
*  and being aligned with Donald Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=281.14s)]
*  I write about extensively in the book, he's also gotten very engaged over the last few [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=283.54s)]
*  years with kind of warning about the dangers children face in schools. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=287.5s)]
*  And I want to emphasize this, the survivor here, in this case, Cindy, doesn't want this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=292.5s)]
*  story to become just about politics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=298.58s)]
*  She's very primarily concerned with Robert Morris not being in leadership and kind of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=300.58s)]
*  attacking the culture that allows us to permeate. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=306.06s)]
*  But at the same time, lots of other people have watched as people like Robert Morris [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=308.5s)]
*  have warned that teachers and school librarians are a danger to children because, and have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=314.3s)]
*  used the language that they're grooming children because they have books on their shelves. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=320.34s)]
*  Morris has preached about that from the pulpit and, you know, endorsed specific school board [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=325.58s)]
*  candidates who would fight against, you know, Satan's work in school libraries. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=330.82s)]
*  People who saw that play out are really frustrated and outraged now knowing, you know, he's pointing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=336.98s)]
*  at school librarians. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  Some of these books that were being targeted actually are literature that describe grooming [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=343.9s)]
*  as a way of helping kids understand what warning signs to watch out for. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=350.22s)]
*  And so to have him be standing in the pulpit warning about this, given his history, has [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=354.82s)]
*  been, you know, a lot, really difficult for people to process. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=359.74s)]
*  And there's a lot of anger, both among survivors and educators who've been targeted by this [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=364.34s)]
*  rhetoric. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=369.5s)]
*  Yeah, I would note in 2017, as you reported, he called on parishioners to support a bill [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=370.5s)]
*  pitched by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, as a way to, quote, protect the safety of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  women and children that would have banned transgender people from using public bathrooms that correspond [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=378.14s)]
*  with their genders. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=383.05999999999995s)]
*  Important to protect children from sexual abuse. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=384.05999999999995s)]
*  On that, I agree. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=388.58s)]
*  Mike Hixinbaugh, thank you very much. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=392.5s)]
*  Excellent new book that came for the schools, One Town's Fight Over Race and Identity and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=393.5s)]
*  the New War for American Classrooms is out now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=397.54s)]
*  I suggest you check it out. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaMCiQre-8M&t=400.38s)]
