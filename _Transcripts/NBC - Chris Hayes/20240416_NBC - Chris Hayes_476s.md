# Judge scolds Trump for ‘intimidating’ potential jurors on Day 2 of New York trial
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA)
*  Lisa Rubin is MSNBC legal correspondent, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=0.0s)]
*  has been watching the trial unfold from inside the courthouse. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=3.04s)]
*  Catherine Christian spent over 30 years as a prosecutor in that office, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=5.72s)]
*  Manhattan District Attorney's Office, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=9.56s)]
*  and they will join me now. Great to have you here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=10.82s)]
*  Let's- can we start with the moment with the juror, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=13.36s)]
*  and the Trump saying something within, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  in the words of Judge Marshawn, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  12 feet of the juror in the response. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=22.56s)]
*  Just take me through that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=24.2s)]
*  So Judge Marshawn, after that juror left the stand, essentially, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=25.8s)]
*  she was being questioned, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=31.04s)]
*  after she left and Judge Marshawn decided he was not going to excuse her for cause. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=32.24s)]
*  He said, I have something that I want to put on the record. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=37.88s)]
*  And that's when he said, Mr. Blanche, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  your client, while this prospective juror was sitting no more than 12 feet away from him, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=43.4s)]
*  was audibly saying something and looking in her direction. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  I couldn't quite make out what it was. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=53.72s)]
*  This is Marshawn saying this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=55.68s)]
*  I couldn't quite make out what it was. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=57.16s)]
*  But I want you to understand that witness intimidation will not be tolerated in my courtroom. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=58.96s)]
*  Have a talk with your client. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=65.4s)]
*  Again, I'm going to do my check-in that I always do. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=67.4s)]
*  Catherine, with you, who practiced for 30 years in that office, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=70.44s)]
*  like a common thing in voir dire, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=72.88s)]
*  to have the defendant like audibly saying things to the jurors. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=75.28s)]
*  Only the, and I'm not making light of this, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=79.88s)]
*  only the mentally unwell ones. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=81.92s)]
*  That's the only time you see criminal defense acting out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=83.56s)]
*  Literally. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  In that kind of situation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=86.92s)]
*  And then it's sort of, you understand it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  That someone who, for some deep psychological medical reasons, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=89.32s)]
*  literally can't control themselves. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=92.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  And that's really the only case. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=94.72s)]
*  That's the only time you ever see that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  I will say that having watched both Heegyn Carroll trials, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  the first of which Donald Trump did not attend, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=101.32s)]
*  the second of which he did attend, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  there were some episodes that were reminiscent of what happened today. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't recall them happening during jury selection themselves, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  but there were times when lawyers were speaking in the courtroom [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=111.36s)]
*  and he disagreed vociferously with what they were saying. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=114.04s)]
*  And for demonstrative effect, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=116.64s)]
*  Donald Trump pounded the table or shook his head or crossed his arms [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=119.2s)]
*  to indicate his vigorous disagreement with what was being said. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=122.96s)]
*  And we all know how that story ended. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  None of the jurors were positively impacted by that performance. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=129.6s)]
*  In fact, there were jurors in that case [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=133.92s)]
*  who I thought were not at all partial to Heegyn Carroll, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=136.76s)]
*  who looked the other way when her lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, was closing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=139.48s)]
*  I really thought that something might happen that we weren't expecting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=142.92s)]
*  And yet, unanimously, they found for her. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=147.8s)]
*  So that's a long way of saying you can't always read into [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=150.6s)]
*  prospective jurors or jurors' behavior [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=154.12s)]
*  just based on what a defendant does in the courtroom. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=155.96s)]
*  So I'm going to start with where we are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=158.4s)]
*  and then work backwards to how we got here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=161.2s)]
*  So as of today, we've got seven jurors sworn in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=163.16s)]
*  Now, again, this is not my thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=166.12s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  It seems to me so fast. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this is... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  Judge Machan is known as a fair and efficient judge. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=174.48s)]
*  This is remarkable because this type of defendant, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  meaning very high profile, that people have strong opinions, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=180.48s)]
*  this is very remarkable that he was able to, Judge Machan, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  get seven jurors, which means he only needs five more for the 12 [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  and an additional six for the all-terrain. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=192.56s)]
*  He also worked overtime today, Judge Machan. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Courts close at 4.30. He worked to 5.30. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=196.88s)]
*  So it shows that he's... We're going to do this by Thursday. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=199.76s)]
*  And he probably will, unless something happens and, you know, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=203.0s)]
*  things happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=205.96s)]
*  But I think there will be a complete jury [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=206.96s)]
*  by the end of the day on Thursday. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=209.12s)]
*  Now, just to benchmark this, we had a former New York judge [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=210.72s)]
*  sitting in that chair, Judge Kiesel, on Thursday, I believe. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=215.0s)]
*  And she was looking at this saying, like, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=218.36s)]
*  I don't know, man, this could be a few weeks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=219.8s)]
*  And you know what? She's a friend of mine. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=221.72s)]
*  There's only one other judge in that courthouse [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=224.36s)]
*  who would get a jury as fast as this judge. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=226.6s)]
*  Judge Pickles, hello. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=229.32s)]
*  So it's... [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=230.64s)]
*  It just... He has done a remarkable job, Judge Machan. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=232.32s)]
*  OK, so the process today... [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  So we already got the 50 who said, I can't. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=236.88s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  It's Donald Trump. Forget it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  I think it's probably the subtext. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=243.04s)]
*  And even some more, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=244.48s)]
*  Because there were not people who took themselves out off the top. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=245.48s)]
*  It came back. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  And when they were ready to take the jury questionnaire, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  basically said, you know, I thought about it overnight. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=254.12s)]
*  So that's two cuts, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=255.12s)]
*  So you've got, like, the, I can't do it, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  then I thought about it for an hour, I can't do it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=258.44s)]
*  Then you have the people who are like, I can do it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=260.0s)]
*  And then you've got this, to me, slightly comical spectacle [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=261.56s)]
*  of Trump's lawyers and legal team furiously [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=267.64s)]
*  checking out the social media profile of these people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=271.44s)]
*  And in a number of cases, finding, you know, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=274.52s)]
*  someone posted an AI video of Trump saying, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=278.08s)]
*  I'm a dumb f-word. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Someone else on the day that I think the election was declared, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=283.08s)]
*  on Facebook being like, honk that horn, baby. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=287.12s)]
*  Lots of memes about Trump being a buffoon or bad or dumb, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=291.12s)]
*  being read into court from the perspective jurors. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=295.4s)]
*  I'm just, what was that like? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=299.08s)]
*  It was fascinating, because on some level, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=302.08s)]
*  some of them you could see really were legitimately struck for cause. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=304.64s)]
*  So I'll give you an example. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=308.44s)]
*  There was someone who, relevant to the events at issue here, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=309.6s)]
*  had posted something on Facebook saying, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=313.56s)]
*  get him out and lock him up. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=315.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=318.12s)]
*  OK? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=318.6s)]
*  That person can't stay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=319.12s)]
*  I think we are all agree, like, nope, can't be on the jury. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, and the person with the AI video was the other person to go. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=323.8s)]
*  But let's talk about the woman with the horn. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  That woman, when she was brought in for questioning, said, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=331.0s)]
*  well, let me put it into some context for you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  I took that video watching what was happening in my neighborhood [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=335.72s)]
*  because election night felt historic to me. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=338.72s)]
*  And it was also evocative of the nightly 7 o'clock cheer [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=340.72s)]
*  that we did in New York for emergency workers and health care [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  workers during that period of time in 2020. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=348.88000000000005s)]
*  And I wanted to remember it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=351.44000000000005s)]
*  Document it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=352.68s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  And she said, I documented it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, sitting here today, do I believe that I can be fair unequivocally? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=360.04s)]
*  And Rashawn said, look, I have the power under our case law [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  to take her out her word, and I'm going to. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=363.12s)]
*  She was struck with a peremptory challenge, but not for cause. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=365.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  Peremptory means, again, just to remind, you get, they each get 10? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=369.08s)]
*  10. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=372.56s)]
*  Where you could just strike people for any reason. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=373.16s)]
*  And if Trump is convicted, they will appeal on that, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=375.2s)]
*  that they were denied that cause and had to use their peremptory challenge. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=378.08s)]
*  They will lose that because Judge Mashon, as Lisa said, struck other people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=381.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=386.52s)]
*  And didn't even wait for cause. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=386.72s)]
*  It just says, you're gone. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=388.16s)]
*  And also struck people who self-identified that they couldn't be fair. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=389.64s)]
*  So there is no appealable issue, assuming Donald Trump is convicted, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=393.68s)]
*  on the jury selection. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  Chris, can I point out something else, too, that's unusual about today? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=400.12s)]
*  Because as a person who practiced primarily in federal courts, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=402.48s)]
*  I find New York State Court, voir dire, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=404.76000000000005s)]
*  that's the questioning of the prospective jurors, fascinating. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  Because it's conducted by the lawyers. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=410.36s)]
*  It reads like watching a focus group conducted by two different lawyers. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=412.0s)]
*  Where they're like, here are some themes that are important to me, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=417.0s)]
*  or here are some issues I really care about. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=419.64000000000004s)]
*  What do you think about that, juror number one? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you think about that, juror number two? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=423.36s)]
*  You know that Lee Greenwood song, Proud to be American? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  Hey, you like that song? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=427.04s)]
*  You like the Lee Greenwood song? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=428.24s)]
*  But for Todd Blanch, it was an opportunity to connect with them [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  and to try and get from them, what is your opinion of Donald Trump [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=433.2s)]
*  when they didn't want to give it? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=436.44s)]
*  And to have to be friendly? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=439.32s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, Kathryn Christian, great to have you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6nwY388RyA&t=439.96000000000004s)]
