# ‘The corruption of Lindsey Graham’ Why the senator risked indictment for Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w)
*  He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=0.0s)]
*  He doesn't represent my party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=5.24s)]
*  He doesn't represent the values that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=7.12s)]
*  for. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=11.24s)]
*  And you know how you make America great again? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=12.24s)]
*  Tell Donald Trump to go to hell. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  I've seen that clip like a thousand times. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=17.28s)]
*  I'm exaggerating. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=19.6s)]
*  50 times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=20.6s)]
*  Still really wild, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Back in 2015, then presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, not a big fan of Donald Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  At one point, Trump infamously retaliated by sharing Graham's private phone number at [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=28.04s)]
*  a rally, which in turn led to Graham making a big show of destroying his phone to end [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=31.8s)]
*  the harassment from angry Trump fans. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=37.16s)]
*  And admittedly, it's a bit of a publicity stunt. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=39.44s)]
*  Just a few years later, Graham was firmly on Team Trump, going so far as to assist the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=42.8s)]
*  ex-president in his attempted coup by pressuring Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Raffensperger into overturning Biden's victory in the state, or at least maybe tossing out [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=50.56s)]
*  some absentee ballots he thought might help Trump get the win. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=55.16s)]
*  It was that endeavor, of course, which led to a Georgia special grand jury recommending [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=59.4s)]
*  Graham be indicted in Fulton County, something that ultimately did not happen, likely due [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=63.8s)]
*  in large part to the logistical hurdles of indicting a sitting senator in state court. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=68.08s)]
*  Directly after the January 6 attack when Trump's mob stormed Graham's place of work, he, like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=74.64s)]
*  many others, claimed he was done. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=78.56s)]
*  But it didn't take too long before he was back on the Trump train. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=81.04s)]
*  So what exactly happened? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=100.28s)]
*  How did Lindsey Graham go from hardline Never-Trump-er to risking criminal exposure for the ex-president, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=101.28s)]
*  briefly back to being a Never-Trump-er before endorsing him for a third campaign? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=107.96s)]
*  Will Saladin is a writer for The Bull Work who has spent a year going through Lindsey [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Graham's archive of public statements. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=116.16s)]
*  The end result was a book-length story called The Corruption of Lindsey Graham, and he joins [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  me now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  Will, I've been enjoying your case study. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  And first, let's just start with the news out of the Fulton County grand jury. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, again, he was not actually charged, but he did make these calls. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  And what's striking about them is it wasn't like one of these things where you get cornered [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=137.24s)]
*  by a microphone and you kind of have to say the line, you know, is the toe of the Trump [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  line. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=145.68s)]
*  This was done behind the scenes, affirmatively of his own volition and enterprise. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=146.68s)]
*  This wasn't like he was pandering. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=152.4s)]
*  And that, to me, really sticks out about what it says about him and his character. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Well from the beginning of right after the election, Lindsey Graham was engaged in a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  very public campaign to help Donald Trump try to overturn the results. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=166.04s)]
*  He was obviously spreading. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=171.0s)]
*  Lindsey Graham was all over Fox News. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=173.12s)]
*  He was spreading myths and lies about election fraud. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=174.68s)]
*  And this call to Raffensperger was part of a campaign. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=178.4s)]
*  Trump wanted all of his accomplices, including Graham, to be doing everything they could [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=181.68s)]
*  to try to help him overturn these state results in the key states. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=185.88s)]
*  And this call to Raffensperger was Graham's version of the phone call that Trump later [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=190.16s)]
*  made to Raffensperger. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=195.92s)]
*  And Trump's phone call is very explicit, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=198.44s)]
*  He says, I need you to find me 11,780 votes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=201.04s)]
*  Graham appears to have done a much, Graham is a trained lawyer and he's a smarter guy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=204.6s)]
*  And he appears to have done a much smarter version of the call in which he didn't say, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=210.64s)]
*  go find me the votes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=214.24s)]
*  He said, you know, Brad, what could you do about these counties where there were a lot [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=215.56s)]
*  of mail-in ballots? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=220.32s)]
*  We don't know whether the signatures were valid. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=221.32s)]
*  We can't prove they aren't. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=223.4s)]
*  But you know, is there something you could do where you could just sort of set those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=224.48s)]
*  ballots, all the ballots, the mail-in ballots from those counties aside? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=227.16s)]
*  So he was doing a clever version of what Trump was doing to try to undermine the result. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=231.16s)]
*  And he managed to do it, obviously, in a way where Trump gets indicted, but Graham doesn't. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=235.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  And let's be clear here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  When he's saying that, can you set the mail-in ballots? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  We've got to go back to 2020, an election where we knew that the mail-in ballots were [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=244.68s)]
*  running, you know, 80-20 or whatever they were, hugely for Biden, the in-person vote [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=249.08s)]
*  going the opposite way. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=253.44s)]
*  So it's like the categories of votes were proxies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=254.44s)]
*  You know what you're doing if you're asking someone to set aside mail-in ballots. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=262.32s)]
*  And the dispute here is, did he actually ask Raffensperger to set them aside or did he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=264.0s)]
*  just say sort of, you know, is this a legal thing that one could do? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=269.16s)]
*  Because Trump is very explicit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=273.6s)]
*  You can hear in Trump's phone call, I need you to do this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  Graham, if he doesn't express it as an imperative, does he get away with it? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=278.52s)]
*  And the answer is, with seven of the special grand jurors, apparently, that was enough. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=282.68s)]
*  And that was enough to deter Fannie Willis from proceeding with the Graham part of the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=287.42s)]
*  indictment. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=290.92s)]
*  You know, it's funny, when I talk to people in the world, not on television about politics, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=291.92s)]
*  there's a bunch of questions people ask. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=296.44s)]
*  You know, one of them that comes up with some frequency is like, what's the deal with Lindsey [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=297.72s)]
*  Graham? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=300.88s)]
*  Like, it's a fairly, like, people are like, what? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=302.0s)]
*  Like, I don't get it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=304.52s)]
*  What was he pretending then? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Is he pretending now? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=306.8s)]
*  Like, what's your theory, having basically written a book about this, of the answer to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=307.8s)]
*  that question? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=313.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=314.76s)]
*  The simple answer is, there isn't a moment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=315.76s)]
*  There isn't some, you know, a lot of people you've heard say, oh, Trump blackmailed him. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  There was some golf outing where Trump, you know, told Graham he was going to spill some [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=322.56s)]
*  dark secret about Graham and then Graham came over. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=326.28s)]
*  That's not what happened. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=328.96s)]
*  There's no evidence of that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  What happened is a long, slow process. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  Remember, in the clips you played at the 2015, Graham was trying to stop Trump from becoming [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=334.3s)]
*  the Republican nominee and from gaining power. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  Once Trump got the Republican nomination, Graham started to coach him on how to win [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=342.62s)]
*  the election. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=347.0s)]
*  And then once Trump won the election and was going to be president, Graham wanted to influence [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=348.1s)]
*  policy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=353.18s)]
*  And Graham does believe in an internationalist interventionist foreign policy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=354.18s)]
*  So he wanted to have influence in Trump's White House. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=358.5s)]
*  And he gradually just began to rationalize everything Trump did. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=361.64s)]
*  You know, Chris, it was Trump's initiative, not Graham's. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=365.58s)]
*  Trump did things like firing Jim Comey. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=368.38s)]
*  And those are the things that Graham increasingly rationalized, one after another after another, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=371.26s)]
*  so that Graham could have access to Trump's ear. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=376.54s)]
*  Even today, you can see when Graham is on TV, those interviews he's doing on Fox, they're [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=381.04s)]
*  not for you and me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=385.4s)]
*  Those are for Donald Trump. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=386.88s)]
*  They're for the guy that he wants Trump to believe that if Trump gets back in power, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=388.56s)]
*  Trump should call Lindsey Graham, bring him back into the White House, and for him to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=393.32s)]
*  be the voice, the counselor on foreign policy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=397.16s)]
*  It is a really good case study in a certain kind of corruption, deep, not corruption in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=400.24s)]
*  the sense of bribery, but it's like the deep, deep sense of corruption of one's soul, Will [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=405.16s)]
*  Saliton. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=410.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=411.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJeKZFPIm2w&t=412.16s)]
