# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 25
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. So Donald Trump's closing arguments to voters in New Hampshire this past weekend into Election Day on Tuesday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The issue he's most focused on now as the man on the glide path to be the Republican nominee and run for president is that he can't be prosecuted for crimes he committed when he was president. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=8.0s)]
*  That's his that's his North Star. It's now his central platform plan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=19.0s)]
*  And 16 days ago, Donald Trump's lawyers argued that ex-presidents, all ex-presidents, but particularly Donald Trump, are immune from prosecution and that therefore Trump has total immunity and cannot be brought to justice for his blatant efforts to steal the 2020 election. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=24.0s)]
*  And now, that was two weeks ago, over two weeks later, we're still waiting for the judge's decision as Trump racks up delegates at the primary and the election looms closer every day. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, many people are understandably anxious to find out if Donald Trump actually can be held legally accountable for an effort to overthrow America's Constitutional Republic, culminating in January 6th. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=51.0s)]
*  The problem for everyone who wants to see Trump actually face a trial on justice and everyone who would like this all to just be over, is that the justice system is slow. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Justice system doesn't work on anyone else's timeline, not a campaign timeline and certainly not a cable news timeline. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=74.0s)]
*  We just saw an example of this today with former Trump advisor Peter Navarro. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=80.0s)]
*  Remember that guy? He got sentenced today to four months in prison. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=84.0s)]
*  Navarro, along with Steve Bannon, orchestrated one of Trump's coup plots intended to block the certification of electoral votes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=88.0s)]
*  And he didn't try to hide it. In fact, he even described the very plot in great detail to Ari Melbourne. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=96.0s)]
*  This plan we had called the Green Bay sweep, clearly between constitutional and legal lines, to basically have only legal votes counted in the election. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=103.0s)]
*  And the plan was simply this. We had over 100 congressmen and senators on Capitol ready to implement the sweep. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=114.0s)]
*  The sweep was simply that. We were going to challenge the results of the election in the six battleground states. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah, you were going to try a coup. Now unsurprisingly, Peter Navarro attracted the attention of the January 6th committee, which issued him a subpoena that Navarro ignored. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=131.0s)]
*  And in September he was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress for ignoring those subpoenas. They weren't long trials. He had no defense. He clearly had ignored them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=142.0s)]
*  And I have to say, I don't feel any particular joy at all about a 74-year-old man going to prison for four months. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=151.0s)]
*  But Peter Navarro sentencing is welcome news in the sense it is absolutely necessary for there to be some measure of legal accountability for the people who committed gross crimes against our democracy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=157.0s)]
*  Once again, the problem is the timing. Navarro's sentence will not deter anyone else from defying a subpoena from the January 6th committee because the committee no longer exists. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=167.0s)]
*  It was disbanded over a year ago. I mean, he may not even serve his time for quite a while, if at all. He will almost certainly appeal his conviction, putting the sentence on hold. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=179.0s)]
*  His co-conspirator Steve Bannon is still walking free, released on his own recognizance pending his appeal out there with three shirts and a podcast a year after his sentencing on the very same charges. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=189.0s)]
*  We've got two sayings about the justice system. They're cliches, but people use it for a reason. And I think they get at the heart of this whole conflict, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=200.0s)]
*  One is, justice delayed is justice denied. If the legal system moves too slowly, then it can't deliver justice at all. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=208.0s)]
*  And the other, in direct tension with that idea, is the wheels of justice turn slowly but grind exceedingly fine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=216.0s)]
*  So yes, the legal system moves slowly, but it gets the right result. And it has to grind slowly to grind fine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=222.0s)]
*  Now, of course, we live in the era of Donald Trump, whose strategy at every turn is to test the law, to try to get away with as much as possible. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=229.0s)]
*  And one of the ways he does that is to delay, delay, delay long enough for issues to become moot or for him to return to the White House or for litigants to just give up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=236.0s)]
*  And we've seen that over and over. The justice system often moves slowly enough that he can't outrun it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=246.0s)]
*  And delaying justice, getting those wheels to turn as slowly as possible, for him has really worked. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=252.0s)]
*  From the very beginning, here's an example of Donald Trump's term as president. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=259.0s)]
*  It was clear he had conflicts of interest through his businesses that really looked like they violated the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=263.0s)]
*  Multiple groups filed suit, and those cases turned so slowly through the system, they were eventually dismissed by the Supreme Court days after Trump left office because they were moot. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=273.0s)]
*  And there was Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's effort to obtain Trump's tax returns. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=284.0s)]
*  After an 18-month legal battle, Trump finally turned over those documents again after he was out of the White House. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=289.0s)]
*  You may also remember Trump White House counsel Don McGahn, who, like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, refused to comply with a congressional subpoena about Trump's attempts to interfere in the Mueller investigation to obstruct justice. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=296.0s)]
*  It took two years before McGahn was finally forced to testify, long after Trump was out of the White House and back in Mar-a-Lago and the whole chapter had closed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=309.0s)]
*  Oh, good. Okay. Well, yeah, we won. We get Don McGahn's testimony. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=319.0s)]
*  And that, of course, brings us to the most high-stake case of all, the four criminal cases against Donald Trump, totaling 91 felony counts. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=323.0s)]
*  The speed at which these cases move is obviously absolutely critical. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=331.0s)]
*  This is a zero-sum game. This is a finite thing. There are 284 days left until the election. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=337.0s)]
*  Every single day, Trump and his lawyers are able to delay the proceedings to push back a trial is a victory for the ex-president. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=344.0s)]
*  Now, to her credit, Judge Tanya Chukgin, overseeing the federal case about Trump's attempted coup, has been moving quite efficiently. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=351.0s)]
*  She set a trial date for March 4th, but the case is on hold while we await the appeals court decision on Trump's immunity argument. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=358.0s)]
*  It's also clear the slow pace of Trump's cases are already helping him politically. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=366.0s)]
*  As the Wall Street Journal explains, the former president is proving less vulnerable on the legal front than many of his critics predicted. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=371.0s)]
*  Trump has raised money on his legal battles, seeing his support grow as he depicts himself as a victim of partisan prosecutors marshaling a crooked justice system to thwart his bid for a second term in the White House. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=377.0s)]
*  Now, I want to be very crystal clear here. It is wholly improper and illegitimate for the justice system to hurry up for the purpose of hurting Donald Trump politically. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=388.0s)]
*  That's not what we want and not what I'm saying. But what is a legitimate argument and an important one, and it's one that both Judge Chukgin and Special Counsel Jack Smith have made, is that there is a public interest to bring Donald Trump to trial swiftly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=398.0s)]
*  Right? Trying the ex-president would definitively establish whether or not he did what he is accused of. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=414.0s)]
*  And that information, that is information that voters deserve to have. To be clear, an acquittal as much as a conviction, don't you think? Right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=421.0s)]
*  Don't you think if he's acquitted, not guilty, voters should know that too? That's information everyone should have before they decide if they want to send him back to the White House. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=430.0s)]
*  Now, based on what we've seen from Republican primary voters so far, I don't know if it would make much difference in the outcome to them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=439.0s)]
*  But the question is, will that key information, is the man guilty or not of attempting to subvert the Constitution, that key information and the ability to make an informed choice with it, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=447.0s)]
*  will that be taken away from the 150 million Americans who are going to vote in November? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=459.0s)]
*  Did you ever have a flicker when you're taking a shower, walking to work or waking up in the morning when you said, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=469.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, you've won every battle you've ever fought, why don't you run for governor, why don't you run for president? Do you ever think about that? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=474.0s)]
*  People want me to all the time. What about you? I don't like it. Why? Can you imagine how controversial that'd be? You think about him with the women, how about me with the women? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=479.0s)]
*  That was from 1998. Trump was nothing if not grossly prescient. Today, after being warned to keep his voice down in court, Trump took the witness stand briefly, very briefly, in his sexual abuse defamation damages trial. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=488.0s)]
*  The ex-president has already been found liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. She said that he raped her in a dressing room. He called her a liar. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=502.0s)]
*  A jury found that he was lying, in fact, and was defaming her. He said on the stand that he considered the finding to be a, quote, false allegation. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=512.0s)]
*  But again, it's not a false allegation. In fact, calling it a false allegation is the defamation he's been found liable of in the first place. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=520.0s)]
*  And so that testimony was promptly stricken, and Trump was soon sent back to the defense table. Trump says he will be back in court tomorrow for closing arguments. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=529.0s)]
*  In addition to showing up at his sexual abuse defamation trial, Trump has also been reminding voters just who he is, with increasingly nasty attacks on his only remaining rival in the Republican primary, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=537.0s)]
*  I know her very well. She's not tough enough. She's not smart enough. And she wasn't respected enough. She cannot do this job. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=567.0s)]
*  Trump handily won the first two contests for the Republican nomination. But as you can see in the exit polling in New Hampshire, that victory was due in large part to a specific sector of the electorate. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=575.0s)]
*  The big wins. Men broke for Trump 49% to 39% for Haley. A 20 point difference. And single men? Well, they overwhelmingly preferred Trump 68% to 30%, plus 38% among single men. That's interesting. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=586.0s)]
*  But women? Well, only 51% preferred Trump. 47% wanted Haley. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=601.0s)]
*  Katie Fang served as a prosecutor in the state attorney's office in Florida's Miami-Dade County. She's the host of the Katie Fang Show, which airs Saturdays at noon here on MSNBC. She's been following E. Jean Carroll trial closely, and she joins me now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=607.0s)]
*  I continue to be astounded that the person who is likely to be the nominee continues to draw attention to an accusation that he raped a woman and then defamed her. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=619.0s)]
*  An accusation that was essentially substantiated in the civil trial, and he was back at doing exactly that today. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=632.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it's on brands, one and two, because he's able to raise money off of it, and three, because he's a virus. And the Trump virus infects his followers, and it gives them kind of the cover to be able to emulate him and to say and do things that are mimicking of Donald Trump. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=642.0s)]
*  And so because of that, that is the reason why Trump feels comfortable to lean into what he has done, which is exposed him to a minimum of $5 million so far. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=663.0s)]
*  And we'll see another big verdict come out of this second defamation trial from E. Jean Carroll. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=674.0s)]
*  But as the numbers show, Chris, as you see, it's starting to very much whittle away, I believe, at the support that he may have seen previously with female voters. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=679.0s)]
*  But look, the truly decent ones were never going to support Donald Trump. His misogyny, his disgust for women, the way that he treats them as evidenced by the way that he's treated E. Jean Carroll and others, that was never really for the decent women. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=691.0s)]
*  And so because of that, when you now see that there is an accountability alarm that is ringing loud and clear across the country and many different courtrooms, this particular case is the one that, bizarrely so, he's decided is the one that he's going to show up to court for. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=706.0s)]
*  It's the one that he wants to take the stand for, even though he was merely the three-minute man today. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=724.0s)]
*  But it's the one that he's leaning into, which makes absolutely no sense. But yet if you stop and you think about it, it kind of does because it fits exactly the mold that he broke when he was made. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to read, because I want to get your feedback on the legal strategy here, because I don't think there is one. I think this is pure ego and insolence. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=739.0s)]
*  And I think it's also just a sense that like no one can hold you accountable. So you don't have to listen to anyone because no one ever has before. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=747.0s)]
*  And, you know, when they're a star, they let you do what you want, like in a literal sense. That's what he said on the Access Hollywood tape. In this sense, he is acting it out in courtroom with the woman who says he raped her and a civil jury substantiated. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=753.0s)]
*  So he takes a stand. Basically, the judge is like, you can't just let him go off like there are rules. And the judge says, I want to know everything he's going to say. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=765.0s)]
*  And Miss Habba says, I do not have an answer to that other than he stands by his deposition, his testimony, the plaintiff brought in. He's going to say he stands by his testimony there. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=774.0s)]
*  He's going to say he did not make the statements to hurt Miss Carroll. He's going to say the judge respond the accusations and deny them. The statements speak from the cells. They've already been put into evidence. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=782.0s)]
*  And that is 100% of what he would say on the witness stand. I have three questions, Your Honor. I just ran through it. Answer my question. I can't tell you. Answer my question. I'm not testifying for my client, Your Honor. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=790.0s)]
*  You are making an offer of proof and your client is bound by it. And so he then gets on and he begins to essentially defame her again and gets yanked off. Is there some legal chess being played here I'm not getting or is this what it looks like? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=799.0s)]
*  I think you're imputing a little bit too much strategy to some situation wherein it doesn't exist. I will say this. So Habba did exactly what her client wanted her to do, which was push boundaries, because that's a Donald Trump thing. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=814.0s)]
*  You want to push the boundaries to see what you get away with. But the problem is that Donald Trump has been confronted with two significant things in this particular trial. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=826.0s)]
*  One, E. Jean Carroll. He finally has somebody who's holding him to task, holding him to account for what the wrongs that he has done and that he's inflicted on someone. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=835.0s)]
*  The fact that it took someone at her age and that it's a woman to do it is particularly significant. But two, he's also been confronted with Judge Lewis Kaplan. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=844.0s)]
*  So Judge Kaplan in this case has had him and Alina Habba on the tightest of leashes. And he's not tolerated anything. And he's basically said, I'm not going to give you leeway in any capacity. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=853.0s)]
*  So Alina Habba decided to try, but she couldn't get away with it. And I think it's going to blow up in his face because Donald Trump's having this jury that's watching this happen. And none of it is positive for Donald Trump. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=865.0s)]
*  Katie Fang, it's always a pleasure. Thank you so much. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=877.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoa3CCiosQ&t=883.0s)]
