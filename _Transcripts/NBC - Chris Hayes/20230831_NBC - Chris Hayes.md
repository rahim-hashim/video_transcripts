# Top Oversight Democrat calls for subpoena of Jared Kushner’s Saudi ties
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30)
*  So Jared Kushner was a New York City rich kid, took over his daddy's business after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Christie threw him in the clink, and then he married Ivanka Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=4.36s)]
*  That is about all it took for him to get placed in one of the most powerful positions in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=8.64s)]
*  world, senior advisor to the president of the United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=12.32s)]
*  One of the highest level jobs in the White House, Kushner had access to some of the nation's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=15.68s)]
*  top intelligence. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=19.88s)]
*  He dealt with all sorts of foreign governments, kind of parallel state department basically. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=20.88s)]
*  He oversaw U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East because why not? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=25.2s)]
*  He's my son-in-law. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=28.12s)]
*  But his relationship with Saudi Arabia stood out in particular in what happened six months [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  after he left the government when his private equity fund received $2 billion with a B from [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=33.76s)]
*  the Sovereign Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, a fund chaired by the de facto leader, Crown [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=38.92s)]
*  Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  While Republicans continue to obsess over Hunter Biden and whether he traded on his [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=45.88s)]
*  last name for access and money, there's a real question as to why did Jared Kushner get [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=49.6s)]
*  like billions of dollars from MBS? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=54.32s)]
*  And some Democrats are saying, well, let's see that guy's laptop. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=57.84s)]
*  Back in February, Congressman Jamie Raskin, ranking member of the Oversight Committee, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  sent a previously undisclosed letter to the Republican chair of the committee, James Comer, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=65.72s)]
*  urging him to join an investigation Democrats opened up into Kushner. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=69.44s)]
*  Comer ignored that letter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=73.36s)]
*  Today, Congressman Raskin is renewing that call, sending another letter to Comer asking [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=74.88s)]
*  for the chair to subpoena Kushner's investment firm, citing the quote, glaring likely violations [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=78.48s)]
*  of American law. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=84.34s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democratic of Maryland, serves as the ranking member of the Oversight [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=86.4s)]
*  Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, what is your what are you after here with your colleague on this committee? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=91.76s)]
*  Well, we've been trying to get this information for more than a year, Chris. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=97.12s)]
*  We know that Kushner pocketed $2 billion and a $25 million a year management fee from the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=103.4s)]
*  government and the UAE and the Qatar government have also kicked in money. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=113.4s)]
*  So there's more than $3 billion in there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=118.68s)]
*  We want to be able to reconstruct what exactly those countries got out of it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=123.52s)]
*  Remember that the Saudi Arabian Sovereign Wealth Fund advisors recommended against giving [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=128.7s)]
*  that money to Jared Kushner on the grounds that he was inexperienced and they were asking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=135.6s)]
*  a ridiculous sum of money. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=142.72s)]
*  And their advisors were overruled by the homicidal crown prince himself, Mohammed bin Salman, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=144.8s)]
*  who of course had been essentially bailed out of his situation that he'd gotten himself [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=151.56s)]
*  into when he ordered the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi back in 2018. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=158.56s)]
*  So, you know, the Trumps did a lot for them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump bragged about it, said, saying, in essence, he saved the prince's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=171.28s)]
*  posterior multiple times and he wanted to continually remind him of that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, we know that Jared Kushner created a business the day after the Trump administration [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=182.6s)]
*  ended and within a few months he had brought home billions of dollars from the Saudi government. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=188.56s)]
*  So we want all the information in the same way that the committee is going for all the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=195.44s)]
*  information about Hunter Biden, who, after all, never worked for the government, was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=200.0s)]
*  not in the Biden administration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=204.56s)]
*  He is the adult, emancipated son of President Biden. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=207.0s)]
*  They want all that information. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=210.84s)]
*  We should get the information about Jared Kushner, who's not just President Trump's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=212.68s)]
*  son-in-law, but he was actually managing Middle East foreign policy at the time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=217.36s)]
*  There's two details there that I had forgotten and one I didn't know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=225.04s)]
*  I had forgotten the excoriating recommendation from the Oversight Committee being like, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=229.64s)]
*  absolutely not, there's no reason to give this dude this money. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=234.76s)]
*  That was overridden, we think, personally by MBS. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=237.36s)]
*  I'd forgotten that crucial detail. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=240.64s)]
*  I didn't know the $25 million management fee, or whatever, that you're meaning like, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=242.8s)]
*  it's not just the, you know, you get billions for your fund, but like the management fee [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=247.72s)]
*  that they're charging is a lot of money. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=251.64s)]
*  And that's like, that's like basically direct income for the guy running it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=253.48s)]
*  I mean, that looks like a straight up payoff to me, a quid pro quo, $25 million a year. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=258.28s)]
*  I mean, like, that's the interest you would have basically on a half a billion dollars [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=264.32s)]
*  that he's, you know, pocketing directly from Mohammed bin Salman, who was obviously expressing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  his gratitude to the Trump administration for going there first in Trump's foreign travels [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=275.88s)]
*  for the cover up of the assassination of Khashoggi, for tilting towards Saudi Arabia [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=281.12s)]
*  in the Yemen war and on and on. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=288.24s)]
*  The Saudis basically got whatever they wanted. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, the foreign emoluments clause, which we've talked about before, applies not just [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  to the president, but anybody holding an office or trust under the federal government. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=298.44s)]
*  So it's clear to me that if that two billion had gone to Kushner a few months before the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=303.44s)]
*  administration was over, that would be a direct violation of the foreign emoluments clause. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  I think it's the same thing if the deal was made during the administration and the money [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=316.0s)]
*  just shows up a few months later. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=320.56s)]
*  It's like, you know, somebody paying a bribe to a city councilman, but they say, well, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=322.2s)]
*  when you step down from the office, that's when you'll get paid. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=326.2s)]
*  That's still a bribe. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=328.88s)]
*  Right. But just to be clear, I mean, that's a huge difference. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=330.64s)]
*  You guys don't have evidence in your hands that that happened. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=333.24s)]
*  Right. I mean, like, just to be clear, like, there's tons of American officials that leave [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  their position and go make a lot of money from all kinds of foreign governments, like, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=339.24s)]
*  you know, and defense contractors and all kinds of people in that town that's in the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=343.92s)]
*  backdrop behind you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  This is a particularly serious example. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=351.12s)]
*  But none of that's illegal, per se. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=353.6s)]
*  You're saying you want to be you want to see evidence such that you can convince yourself [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=356.88s)]
*  that didn't happen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=361.96s)]
*  Well, they are if we're talking about statutory bribery laws or conflict of interest laws. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=364.56s)]
*  But, you know, I'm a purist and an originalist about the Foreign [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=370.52s)]
*  Government Amortiments Clause, which says that nobody who holds an office or trust [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=375.28s)]
*  under the federal government shall receive from a king, a prince or a foreign state [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=381.24s)]
*  a payment of any kind, whatever, without the explicit consent of Congress. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=386.76s)]
*  So even if we didn't know about an explicit quid pro quo, if he had gotten that money [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=391.08s)]
*  while he was in office, it would clearly violate the Foreign Amortiments Clause. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=395.64s)]
*  And I think that, you know, the deal was made and he got it later. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  To me, that's a distinction without a difference. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=403.08s)]
*  All right, Congressman Jamie Raskin, I have to say, Congressman, I do miss the bandana, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=406.52s)]
*  but I am very happy to see you looking so well. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=410.44s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=412.56s)]
*  I appreciate that, Chris. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKmo2tZrH30&t=414.79999999999995s)]
