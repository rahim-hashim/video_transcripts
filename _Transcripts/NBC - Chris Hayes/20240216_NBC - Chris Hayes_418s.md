# 'Democratic superhero': Russian journalist reveals letter Alexei Navalny sent days before death
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0)
*  Navalny knew what would happen when he returned to Russia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=0.0s)]
*  and he had a message for his supporters in the world when it did. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=2.44s)]
*  My message for the situation when I am killed is very simple. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Not give up. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=15.48s)]
*  Do me a favor, answer this one in Russian. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=17.56s)]
*  And here I have an obvious thing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=20.08s)]
*  Do not give up. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  Do not give up. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=29.4s)]
*  If it happens, it means that we are unusually strong at this moment, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  if they decided to kill me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=37.28s)]
*  And I can explain what means he went for a walk. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=50.08s)]
*  In this letter here, he wrote to me that he could not see anything from his prison cell, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=63.68s)]
*  and there was the next cell for walks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=71.28s)]
*  So when he was walking, he was not outside of the prison. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=75.16s)]
*  He was inside and he could not see anything outside. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  So it was a much worse condition than we can imagine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  I imagine you and people like you in your circle, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=90.0s)]
*  people that have been opposed to Putin, Russian exiles, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=92.68s)]
*  and even people within Russia, have been anticipating this moment. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=96.16s)]
*  No. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=101.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  But we used to think that he's not an ordinary human being. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=105.36s)]
*  Navalny. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=113.64s)]
*  I remember that back in 2015, I published a book, All the Kremlin's Men, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=114.16s)]
*  and one of the chapters was about Navalny. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=119.44s)]
*  And I started that chapter saying that he's not an ordinary human being, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=122.44s)]
*  he's an alien. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  He's supernatural. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=129.28s)]
*  He has always been so sure that his destiny was to fight against the regime. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  And everyone seemed to consider him to be the person doomed to be the next president of Russia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=142.04s)]
*  He had to be Russia's first real George Washington. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=147.88s)]
*  He had to be Russia's first democratically elected leader, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  and the leader who wanted Russia to be a democracy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  And we have always considered him to be the next ideal president of Russia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=159.56s)]
*  Like there was fate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=166.32s)]
*  He was fated. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=167.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=168.04s)]
*  He survived assassination attempt back in 2020. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=168.76s)]
*  That time, it was a joke. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=174.48s)]
*  It was not funny, but it was a joke. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=177.16s)]
*  He has always been compared to Harry Potter, who was not killed by- [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=179.2s)]
*  The boy who lived. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=182.68s)]
*  By Walter Mork. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=183.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=184.72s)]
*  So it was impossible to, even this morning, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=185.4s)]
*  no one could believe that that's something beyond our comprehension. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=189.56s)]
*  What does his death mean for Russia in this very, very fraught moment at a time when [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=194.4s)]
*  repression has, in the wake of the war, that's when you left, when basically, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=202.76s)]
*  in the wake of the war, new levels of repression, criminalization of even mentioning the war happened. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=207.16s)]
*  You were forced to leave Russia at that time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  At this moment, when repression has increased so much, what does this mean? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=214.68s)]
*  No. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=219.72s)]
*  A lot of people were, and are, crying today because of his death and because they think [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  that they have lost hope. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Because he was the only, for a lot of people, inside of Russia and outside of Russia, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=231.08s)]
*  he was the symbol of the possibility of that distant democratic future. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  And during the whole day, I was trying to talk to people and try to give them some kind of hope. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=242.68s)]
*  And my idea is that at least we have the moral example. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  At least now we have probably the first real democratic superhero in Russian history, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=259.24s)]
*  because Russian history is very traumatic. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=264.8s)]
*  It's very imperialist. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=268.32s)]
*  In the United States, we have a huge history of violence and not a history of prominent [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=270.04s)]
*  human right defenders. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  So I think that the person who could have become our George Washington, sadly, has become [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  our Martin Luther King. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=290.04s)]
*  But he is going to be our moral example. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=292.56s)]
*  And he is going to be the person who has led us, who has shown the way. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  And he was probably the only idealist. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=301.88000000000005s)]
*  He was the only politician for many years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=305.36s)]
*  I must say that the political process in Russia has been eliminated back 20 years ago. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=307.36s)]
*  And he was the only person who could not agree with the fact that he could not be a politician. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=314.68s)]
*  He was running political campaigns. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=321.48s)]
*  He was fighting against President Putin. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=324.32s)]
*  He was trying to run for president back in 2018. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's important that he has always been an idealistic person. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=333.08s)]
*  He has always believed in human rights, in free speech, in the possibility of fair justice. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=338.44s)]
*  And it's very remarkable for Russia, because Russia is a very cynical country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's the message that Putin's propaganda is trying to spread, that democracy is impossible. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  There are no democratic countries in the world. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=362.28s)]
*  Free speech cannot exist. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  There is no fair justice anywhere in the world. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=367.24s)]
*  Everything, everyone is corrupted. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  It's corrupt, it's rigged, it's fixed. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=373.0s)]
*  And he was the person who spent years trying to defend that righteous cause. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that it's very important, because he is going to be the hero for the generations to come, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=383.08s)]
*  for the generations of Russians. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  Mikhail Zygur, I can't tell you what an honor it is to have you here, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=390.36s)]
*  and thank you for coming on a very, very difficult day. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=394.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=396.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=396.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xJLm5Rvu0&t=412.64s)]
