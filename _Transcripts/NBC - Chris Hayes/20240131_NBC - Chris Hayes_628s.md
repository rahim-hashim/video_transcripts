# 'Booming' Biden economy forces GOP to shift focus to new 'shiny object'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It is 2024 and the American economy is back, baby. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=0.0s)]
*  You don't have to take my word for it. As we've been covering for months on this show, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=6.88s)]
*  there has been and is a gap, lingering gap between the way the economy is actually [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  performing based on every metric we have, which is incredibly well, and the way voters say they [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=15.76s)]
*  feel about the economy, which has been quite pessimistic. It every day brings some new bit [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=21.2s)]
*  of data that demonstrates that the American economy is roaring. Today, it is this chart, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=26.16s)]
*  which you might call the GDP Olympics. Of all of the most developed economies on earth, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=32.32s)]
*  which one do you think is growing the fastest? Well, it's Joe Biden's United States by a lot. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=38.08s)]
*  That big green bar at the top is our GDP here in the good old U.S. of A. Do you see how much [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=45.04s)]
*  bigger it is than all the others? The U.S. is literally the best economy in the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=51.36s)]
*  Last year, our economy grew much faster than Japan, the second best economy, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=58.32s)]
*  more than double the rate of Canada and a distant third. Not only that, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  but we are projected to blow the competition out of the water again this year. And this is just [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=66.4s)]
*  one data point among many. Wages in real terms, real wages, the amount of actual purchasing power [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  are rising. Inflation, by some measures, is falling below the Fed's target. With an anticipation, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=79.6s)]
*  they may start cutting interest rates. Investment in manufacturing has now set record highs. New [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=85.44s)]
*  business formation, that's people making small businesses, has set record highs. Household wealth [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=93.28s)]
*  has set a record high. And today, amid all this good news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell got [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  just about as enthusiastic as it is possible for a central banker like him when discussing the state [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=107.2s)]
*  of the U.S. economy. The labor market, 3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor market is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  strong. We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4 percent. That hasn't happened [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=120.8s)]
*  in 50 years, so it's a good labor market. And we've seen inflation come down. We've talked about that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=127.28s)]
*  So we've got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more to come. So this is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  a good situation, let's be honest. This is a good economy. Just to be clear, for a Fed Chair, that's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=138.16s)]
*  the equivalent of stripping off your clothes and twerking for three minutes straight. Okay, that's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=143.92s)]
*  like, no one does that, all right? The last three years, the Biden administration has essentially, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=148.16s)]
*  get this, put us back on track economically in a better spot than if COVID hadn't happened. I want [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=153.92s)]
*  to say that again, okay? As the White House noted a few weeks ago, quote, the level of U.S. real GDP [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=160.32s)]
*  in 2023 even exceeded some pre-pandemic forecasts, including that of Congressional Budget Office [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=166.4s)]
*  and the IMF. That's right, the economy did better last year than the economic projection showed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=173.52s)]
*  before the pandemic, before COVID, when nobody knew there would be this cataclysmic event and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  recession in 2020. Back in 2019, the Congressional Budget Office, for example, thought GDP would grow [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  by an average of 1.7% in 2023. Again, looking out into the future, not knowing there's going to be [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=193.28s)]
*  a pandemic. It actually grew at 2.5%. And speaking of the pandemic, Trump and his supporters often [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=198.8s)]
*  argue it's unfair to compare Biden's economy to Trump's, since again, COVID tanked the world [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=206.16s)]
*  economy in 2020. But here's the thing, listen to this, okay? If you ignore 2020, Joe Biden was not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=211.28s)]
*  president, Donald Trump was, but let's just throw it out, okay? If you ignore 2020, the economy under [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=218.72s)]
*  Biden is still doing better than Trump's was. Take away COVID, give him a mulligan. As the Washington [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=223.68s)]
*  Monthly notes, quote, under Biden, from January 2022 to December 2023, employment grew at an [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=231.28s)]
*  average annual rate of 2.4% compared to a 1.5% rate under Trump from January 2017 to February 2020. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=237.2s)]
*  So again, if you bend over backwards to give Donald Trump the most favorable comparison possible, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=246.72s)]
*  where you completely take him off the hook for the economy tanking under his watch when he was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=252.08s)]
*  president due to COVID, and you ignore the first year of the Biden presidency when they had the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=256.48s)]
*  huge boom as the world reopened, take that all off the board, Joe Biden's economy is still whooping [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=261.36s)]
*  Trump's butt. So the question becomes, if the economy is doing so well, why don't voters think [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=268.0s)]
*  it is? And I think that's starting to change. There are basically two reasons. So one thing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=275.6s)]
*  you've got to realize is simple partisanship. Republicans will never give a Democrat credit [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  for a good economy. And while there's the same thing vice versa and reverse, it's asymmetric, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=285.12s)]
*  which is to say Democrats are more willing to give Republicans credit. So here's just one example, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  and there's a lot of charts that look like this. Just days after the networks called the 2020 [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  election for Joe Biden, there's a poll asking Democrats and Republicans how they felt about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=300.88s)]
*  the economy going forward. And suddenly in that red line, Republicans feel very pessimistic about [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=305.6s)]
*  the economy. Democrats start to feel better. This is before Joe Biden was even sworn into office. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=310.88s)]
*  But if you stay with this crap for a second, one thing I want you to notice there, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=315.36s)]
*  the drop by Republicans is way more than the gain in Democrats. You see that? Like, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  Republicans are way more partisan in their view of the economy than Democrats, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=325.44s)]
*  even though both sides are pretty partisan. So that's one of the things going on. There's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=330.0s)]
*  a chunk of the population that is never going to give pollsters a positive reaction to a Joe Biden [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=335.12s)]
*  or Democratic economy. But for other folks who might not be very partisan or political, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=340.48s)]
*  there's just a lag. There is a lag between when the economy starts to improve in the numbers [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=346.0s)]
*  and when people feel it, when they feel more secure. That lag is starting to go away. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=351.36s)]
*  We're starting to see people catch up to reality. You could see it in consumer confidence numbers, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=358.24s)]
*  which are improving. This is a problem for the Republicans because they want the economy to do [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=362.64s)]
*  poorly under Joe Biden. You have an economy that's so fragile. And the only reason it's running now [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=369.12s)]
*  is it's running off the fumes of what we did, what the Trump administration, it's just running off the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=375.68s)]
*  fumes. And when there's a crash, I hope it's going to be during this next 12 months, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=380.4s)]
*  because I don't want to be Herbert Hoover. The one president, I just don't want to be Herbert Hoover. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he kind of was Herbert Hoover because again, he was president in 2020 when the whole [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  thing crashed. So he's already that. Also Lindell TV on Jan six. Beautiful touch there. So Trump [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  hasn't gotten his wish with the stock market, even though he's rooting for it to crash. The [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  stock market is booming. The Dow is setting record highs. The economic recovery is so good [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=408.32s)]
*  that even Fox has to like begrudgingly acknowledge it. Now take a look at this headline in the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Washington Post. We bring it to you again because it was a kind of a standout. It says falling [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=421.6s)]
*  inflation and rising growth gives the US the world's best recovery. Steve Forbes with me this [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=426.88s)]
*  morning. I think the Democrats are going to run with that headline. I mean, they're just going to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=432.4s)]
*  plaster this all over the place. But are they right? Is America does America now have the best [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=436.48s)]
*  recovery? Well, yes, I'll bet that the next time KJP or the president takes any kind of questions [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  of any kind on the economy, that Washington Post article is going to be right there front and center. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=449.44s)]
*  We've got the best recovery. And that's a pretty good political slogan in an election year. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=454.32s)]
*  Yes, also helped by the fact that it is just plainly the truth. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  So it's getting to the point where Republicans can no longer ignore reality, right? Which is why [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=463.52s)]
*  instead of denigrating the economy, get this, Donald Trump is now trying to take credit for it [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=467.76s)]
*  on social media, like from one day to the next, which of course is the Trump playbook. Anything [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=473.12s)]
*  bad that happens isn't his fault. Well, he deserves credit for anything good under his watch. It's [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=477.12s)]
*  something his press secretary noted when the first full jobs report of the Trump presidency was released. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=481.92s)]
*  In the past, the president has referred to particular job reports as phony or totally [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=487.52s)]
*  fiction. Does the president believe that this jobs report was accurate and a fair way to measure the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=493.44s)]
*  economy? Yeah, I talked to the president prior to this and he said to quote him very clearly, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=498.24s)]
*  they may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  Haha, very funny. Reality doesn't matter. Nothing matters. It's good when I say it, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=507.28s)]
*  when I'm in power, it's made up when I'm not right. That's the whole thing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  But this idea that Trump actually deserves credit for the Biden economy [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=515.92s)]
*  is just too ridiculous to reach most people. Honestly, like some hardcore partisans are going [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=519.28s)]
*  to be like, yes, it's a Trump stock market or whatever ludicrousness, but that's not going to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=524.32s)]
*  work for most voters. That is why Republicans are simply trying to just change the subject. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=529.12s)]
*  Change the subject. They love to talk about kitchen table issues and the price of eggs, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=536.32s)]
*  all that stuff like six months ago. Now, no, they are reaching for their political safety blanket, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=540.32s)]
*  which is called immigration. That makes them feel safe when they're talking about immigration. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=545.6s)]
*  So right now they are trying to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary the first time in 150 [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=551.12s)]
*  years to impeach a sitting cabinet secretary, 170 years, because they get this disagree with [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  his immigration policy. They think he's not doing a good job and they're doing this in hopes that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=563.36s)]
*  Americans will pay more attention to immigration, the economy. And it's not a crazy idea. There are [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=567.6s)]
*  some signs that might be working. We've got some polling out today that indicates that voters are [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=572.08s)]
*  starting to care more about immigration than the economy, like, oh, the economy is fixed. Well, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=575.76s)]
*  I don't care about that. But even as Republicans try to get you to chase this shiny object, it's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  crucial for Democrats and also for just fair minded journalists and reporters everywhere not to lose [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=585.84s)]
*  sight of the facts. Again, setting aside politics and ideology, just based on the metrics we have, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=591.12s)]
*  we have a lot of numbers about the economy. It's the thing we measure basically more than anything. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=596.88s)]
*  Okay. President Biden has done the best job digging the economy out of a deep hole that we have seen [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=600.16s)]
*  since FDR. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dD-P0JzLZA&t=606.48s)]
