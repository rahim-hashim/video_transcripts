# Report: Trump spent $50 million in donor money on legal bills in 2023
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo)
*  All right, so Donald Trump is now on the clock after a jury ordered him to pay over $83 million to E. Jean Carroll, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=0.0s)]
*  the woman that a jury found he had sexually abused and then subsequently defamed and then kept defaming. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=7.0s)]
*  Once that judgment has been filed, he'll have just 30 days to either fork over the cash or to post some kind of bond in order to file an appeal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=11.8s)]
*  Now, the appeals process can be tricky. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=19.8s)]
*  So Trump is trying other ways to wriggle out of the judgment, including a ridiculous, we've come to expect this, Hail Mary from his lawyer, Alina Haba. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=21.52s)]
*  She just tried to intimate some kind of conflict of interest between the judge and Carroll's lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=29.52s)]
*  because they briefly, like for two years, they worked at the same law firm 30 years ago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=34.96s)]
*  OK, after Kaplan shot down that, frankly, ludicrous claim and warned she could seek sanctions, Haba immediately backed off. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=40.96s)]
*  Of course, in the end, money matters more to Donald Trump than just about anything. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=49.64s)]
*  And he's in a real financial pickle right now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=52.56s)]
*  He's not just facing the 83 million dollar judgment for defaming E. Jean Carroll. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=55.0s)]
*  The New York attorney general is asking for four times that much in his civil fraud trial. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=59.68s)]
*  The decision on that is expected basically any day now and could leave Trump out of pocket and out of business. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=63.4s)]
*  Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal analyst who's been in the courtroom for many of Trump's trials. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Timodayo Agonga-Williams, a former federal prosecutor who served as senior investigative counsel to the January 6th Committee. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=73.76s)]
*  They both join me now. It's great to have you here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=80.08s)]
*  Let me just start on this. They're trying to get a new trial, Trump's lawyers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=82.64s)]
*  They've insinuated that they're going to file a motion for a new trial. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=88.08s)]
*  That's even in the letter where they've conceded that there actually isn't a problem between the two Kaplan's. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=91.16s)]
*  They drop a footnote saying, of course, we're going to address this bias problem that the judge has with us in our post trial motions, including potentially under rule 59. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=97.0s)]
*  Rule 59 is the shorthand for a motion for a new trial. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=107.0s)]
*  And Chris, I want to point out to you and our viewers, they've tried a lot of these kind of wacky things so far. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=109.72s)]
*  They've asked for a recusal of Judge Kaplan on the basis of his relationship with another of E. Jean Carroll's lawyers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=114.92s)]
*  They asked for a mistrial after E. Jean Carroll admitted to deleting death threats against her. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=120.08s)]
*  So this is the third time they've tried for a do over or cutting it short based on bias or alleged improprieties because they know that they don't have real substantive grounds for an appeal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=124.64s)]
*  Now, in terms of substantive grounds for appeal, I was looking into this and talking to some lawyers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  It's not like appealing a federal jury award is not is not very easy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  No, it's not. And partly because the question before that's going to appeal is going to be really about the law. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=146.92s)]
*  You know, the factual question as to sexual assault was handled in a separate trial. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=153.56s)]
*  They cannot appealing this judgment, then try to re litigate that point. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  That was the issue on the trial record here. So the factual record is pretty set. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=161.64s)]
*  So what's going to be happening is they're going to be challenging legal conclusions here, perhaps evidentiary or something otherwise. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=165.64s)]
*  Again, very limited. Or they're going to be saying that the judge erred in finding, as we presume he will, that this was a reasonable civil judgment here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=171.76s)]
*  And which is what they're going to do after the rule 59 motion. They'll try to get that verdict amended. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Judge Kaplan is going to reject that and they'll take that up to the Second Circuit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=185.04s)]
*  But I think important here, the Second Circuit, the appellate court is going to look at Judge Kaplan with very favorable eyes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  He's a very well respected judge in Southern District. And that's one of the most, if not the most respected court in the country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=194.84s)]
*  So it's a really an uphill battle here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=200.72s)]
*  I mean, again, it's one of these things where every day that you can avoid paying the piper is the day you win. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's basically the way they've been operating throughout this entire thing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=207.44s)]
*  We should also know, Lisa, like part of this is he spent 50 million is what we got. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=211.8s)]
*  His super PAC spent 50 million on legal expenses in 2023 on legal bills, investigation related expenses last year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  According to two people, pretty fun figure. But again, spent 50 million. He just raised it all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=224.76s)]
*  That's right. And we're going to find out tomorrow. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=229.28s)]
*  It's like if you go out to dinner, it's like, well, that's an extravagant dinner. Someone else pays for it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you know what? File that other motion. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  What are you going to cost? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=237.6s)]
*  Chris, tomorrow is the FEC's deadline for PACs to make their filing for the second half of 2023. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  So while the New York Times has reported that overall through two PACs, he paid 50 million dollars in legal fees. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=245.6s)]
*  Tomorrow we get that nitty gritty, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=251.44s)]
*  We find out who he paid and what increments. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=253.2s)]
*  And most of the law firms that represent him are not big law firms that could have handled multiple matters. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=256.08s)]
*  They're places like Habba Mideo, which represented him in the Carroll case, or Continental PLLC. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=261.24s)]
*  That's Chris Kise's firm. Chris Kise represents him, obviously, in this New York attorney general's case. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=266.4s)]
*  So it'll be pretty easy for people like us to connect those dots and figure out just exactly what those small dollar donors have been paying for. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=270.68s)]
*  And of course, everybody who donates to Trump campaign, 10 percent of that goes to Save America 2. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=278.12s)]
*  Right. I forgot they were doing that. That's amazing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=284.56s)]
*  It's a little 10 percent just like off the top shuttle payment. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=288.16s)]
*  So then we got we are also obviously we're awaiting the immunity decision by the D.C. circuit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=291.32s)]
*  I'm just you know, watch pot never boils. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=296.44s)]
*  I'm just putting it over here on the back burner. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm not looking at that anymore. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=301.16s)]
*  There's Judge Angorin is going to enter some sort of finding right in the New York civil trial. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=303.24s)]
*  And he's basically going to tell us like what did the did the plaintiffs meet their burden and also how much money. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=309.08s)]
*  Right. Yeah, he's going to give us the number. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=316.4s)]
*  Right. Tish James offices asked for three hundred and seventy million. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=318.84s)]
*  But we're also going to learn whether the defendants, namely the former president, are going to be able to continue to operate a business in New York state or whether they're going to get what's been called the corporate death penalty. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=322.84s)]
*  That's also a big possibility here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=333.4s)]
*  So we'll be looking for the number and Trump's future as a businessman in this in the state. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zrlH_UcRvo&t=335.56s)]
