# Trump scrambles to blame Obama, Biden, diversity policies for deadly plane crash
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y)
*  Less than 24 hours after the worst crash we've seen in over a decade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  The NTSB is clear and frank, right? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Transparent. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=7.2s)]
*  It doesn't know yet what went wrong. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=7.88s)]
*  It doesn't know. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=9.68s)]
*  They're the experts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=10.36s)]
*  But Donald Trump and his sycophants, oh, they know, they know. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=12.32s)]
*  The FAA's website states they include hearing, vision, missing extremities, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=17.2s)]
*  partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=24.0s)]
*  disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism all qualify for the position [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=28.72s)]
*  of a controller of airplanes pouring into our country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=36.16s)]
*  They actually came out with a directive, too white, and we want the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=41.04s)]
*  people that are competent. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=46.84s)]
*  How you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  to do with this crash? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=51.56s)]
*  Because I have common sense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=52.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  And unfortunately, a lot of people don't. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=55.68s)]
*  We want brilliant people doing this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=59.48s)]
*  The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department and we need the best and brightest. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=61.2s)]
*  When we deal with safety, we can only accept the best and the brightest. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=67.28s)]
*  When you don't have the best standards in who you're hiring, it means on the one hand, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  you're not getting the best people in government, but on the other hand, it puts [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=76.8s)]
*  stresses on the people who are already there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=80.24s)]
*  Mr. President, to be clear, are you saying race or gender played a role in this tragedy? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=82.64s)]
*  It may have. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=87.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=88.48s)]
*  Incompetence might have played a role. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=89.44s)]
*  Well, we'll let you know that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  But we want the most competent people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  We don't care what race they are. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=95.36s)]
*  We want the most competent people, especially in those positions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  And you know, you're talking about extremely complex things. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=100.76s)]
*  And if they don't have a great brain, a great power of the brain, they're not going [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=105.72s)]
*  to be very good at what they do and bad things will happen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=110.28s)]
*  Trump is blaming what he likes to call DEI more accurately, initiatives to identify, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=113.84s)]
*  cultivate and elevate talent from all sectors of American life in the federal government, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=119.4s)]
*  basically anti-discrimination measures. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=124.2s)]
*  He's out there again, less than 24 hours blaming his predecessor, blaming women and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=127.36s)]
*  people of color. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=133.24s)]
*  Like, you know, when he says like they said it was too white, we need competent people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=134.64s)]
*  What's he saying there? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=139.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=140.96s)]
*  And he's, of course, doing this to blame anyone but himself, even though I should [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  note, in case you didn't know this, he is the president and as such, he is the head [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  of the entire federal government. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, of course, this is the way Donald Trump operates. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  Despite his desire for essentially unilateral authority, he is a spectator to his own [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=156.36s)]
*  presidency the second something goes wrong. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=162.44s)]
*  Hopping on social media last night, like millions of other people about how the accident [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=165.72s)]
*  was not good, which, OK, yeah, I mean, I guess I agree with that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  Totally consistent about ducking any responsibility ever at any time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  During his first term, and you probably don't remember this incident, there's a big [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  deal. When a military mission in West Africa went wrong, American soldiers lost their [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=182.36s)]
*  lives. Trump did not hesitate to throw his own generals onto the bus, even though he [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  himself was the commander in chief. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=191.08s)]
*  So what? No, I did not specifically, but I have generals that are great generals. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=195.88000000000002s)]
*  He's a great fighter. He's a warrior. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=200.44000000000003s)]
*  I gave them authority to do what's right so that we win. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=204.44s)]
*  That's the authority they have. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=207.24s)]
*  Of course, Trump refused to take any accountability during the covid pandemic, even as [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people died under his watch. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was, in fact, a failing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=217.4s)]
*  Do you take responsibility for that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  To be clear, that was four years into his administration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=237.8s)]
*  As soon as things went sideways, he was blaming the last administration four years in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=240.6s)]
*  We are 11 days into this new administration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=246.36s)]
*  And as you can see, stakes are extremely high across the board. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  And the one thing that Trump administration have been laser focused on, I would even say [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  more than anything else in the first 11 days, is destroying the federal workforce as currently [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=257.08s)]
*  constituted by purging it of independent experts and replacing them with people that will be [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=263.88s)]
*  reliably loyal cronies. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=269.32s)]
*  That is the plan. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=271.16s)]
*  It's easy to throw around terms like unelected bureaucrat, which the right likes to do, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=273.32s)]
*  but unelected bureaucrats are precisely the people who are going to investigate this crash. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=277.56s)]
*  In fact, those are the people working air traffic control and regulating airplane safety. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=283.24s)]
*  When Trump's government sends that email trying to purge workers, to induce them into [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=288.44s)]
*  leaving their jobs, those are the people who are getting purged. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=293.96s)]
*  When the man who is up for possible confirmation to run the Office of Management and Budget that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=297.72s)]
*  issued that memorandum that was rescinded, that guy, Russ Vogt, reportedly said his goal [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=302.12s)]
*  is to put civil servants in trauma. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=309.32s)]
*  When he said that, that's who he's talking about. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=312.52s)]
*  The people that, you know, do air traffic control. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=315.8s)]
*  When Trump and his administration declares a war on the so-called deep state, that is who [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=319.88s)]
*  they're going to war with. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=324.2s)]
*  It is quite literally the people who go to find the facts, who have expertise, who keep [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=325.8s)]
*  our airplanes in the air, who manage the inordinately complex bureaucracies that are [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=331.48s)]
*  the platform and foundation for American flourishing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not some enemy abroad. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=340.12s)]
*  They're targeting the very same people who are going to work right now, as I speak to you, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  right, who are in the Potomac, sifting through the wreckage of this tragedy, trying in good [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=347.32s)]
*  faith with their expertise to actually figure out what happened. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  And what you saw on Capitol Hill today, just down Pennsylvania Avenue, was a bunch of people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  nominated by Trump to the very end of destroying the morale of those experts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=361.48s)]
*  Cash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. were specifically selected in part for their loyalty [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  to Trump and their raw hostility toward the people in the Federal Civil Service who will [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  work for them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=378.92s)]
*  They want to crush those people, to overwhelm them, to purge them, and replace them with [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=379.64s)]
*  the kind of people that blame anti-discrimination initiatives for a plane crash 15 hours after [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=384.92s)]
*  it happened. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=390.68s)]
*  This is MAGA World's own version of affirmative action, which they truly believe in. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=393.24s)]
*  It is affirmative action for sycophants and zealots and creeps and weirdos. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=397.72s)]
*  The stakes cannot be higher. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=404.12s)]
*  Today it's a plane crash. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  A plane crash that we don't know the origins of. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  Tomorrow? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=412.44s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSoXC6hpp_Y&t=413.72s)]
