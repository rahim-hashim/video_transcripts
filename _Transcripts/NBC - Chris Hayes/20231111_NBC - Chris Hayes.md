# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Nov. 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The federal government of the United States is one week away from being shut down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=0.0s)]
*  And yes, I know what you're thinking. Here we are again, thanks to a chaotic and incompetent Republican controlled House of Representatives. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=6.0s)]
*  Now, this is due this time in some part to the fact that they've got a brand new speaker of the House in charge, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=13.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson, who has literally zero experience in House leadership. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=18.0s)]
*  He's never served as a party whip or a conference chair or even chaired a committee. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=24.0s)]
*  That guy is essentially flying by the seat of his pants is going to have to unite this unruly conference into something that can legislate. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=28.0s)]
*  And as Democratic Congressman Sean Caston noted on the House floor this week, it's not going great. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=35.0s)]
*  As you know, we operate on a September 30th fiscal year, and here we are 39 days later. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=41.0s)]
*  And the majority has yet to even propose a way to keep the government open. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=47.0s)]
*  The last September, I kicked the can down the road, kept the government open for 45 days. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=52.0s)]
*  And in the words of Mr. Santos, that made you all big mad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=56.0s)]
*  So you fired your speaker. Now you have a new speaker. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=59.0s)]
*  But a lot of you are still big mad. So instead of working, we are sitting here this week debating nonsense. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=62.0s)]
*  So today we are voting on a bill that would defund the ability of regulators to develop consistent climate accounting rules instead of doing the work of the people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=67.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, science is real. We have real challenges. Please stop being big mad. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=77.0s)]
*  As a congressman alluded to there, here's what's happening right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=85.0s)]
*  There's basically sort of two tracks for this narrow House Republican majority. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=89.0s)]
*  The track they're currently on is one where they ignore their actual responsibilities and instead push an agenda of Fox News culture war nonsense. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=92.0s)]
*  Congressman Castan expanded on that strategy in a very funny Twitter thread citing examples like the House Republican plan to defund the Office of Gun Violence Prevention. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=101.0s)]
*  An amendment to change White House press secretary, Kareem Jean-Pierre's salary to one dollar. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=110.0s)]
*  An amendment to set the salary of the Chairman of Securities Exchange Commission to one dollar. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=116.0s)]
*  Now there's also some big business interests going on here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=120.0s)]
*  House Republicans proposed a plan to slash the budget of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the folks who decide if baby toys are safe for market among other potentially hazardous products. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=123.0s)]
*  They also tried to eliminate something they've been trying to get rid of forever, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, entirely that, of course, an agency in charge of protecting average Americans from predatory and unfair lending practices. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=133.0s)]
*  Additionally, just to make sure Donald Trump is appeased, the third ranking Republican in the House, who you really think would be concentrating like full time on the Congress, Elise Stefanik, has taken the time to file an ethics complaint against the judge overseeing the ex-president's civil fraud case? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=146.0s)]
*  That was all just this week. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=161.0s)]
*  So that's one track for the party, pushing this stunty stuff, doing the business of big business, while the clock ticks towards another shutdown. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=163.0s)]
*  The other track is the actually important one. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=171.0s)]
*  That's the track where Republicans set aside all their various cultural amendments and stunty pranks in order to find a way to fund the various parts of the U.S. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=174.0s)]
*  government using the power of the purse given to them by the founders in Article 1 of our Constitution. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=184.0s)]
*  On this issue, the important stuff, the bedrock stuff, Mike Johnson is just absolutely floundering. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=190.0s)]
*  Now, he insists the House must pass separate bills, not omnibus, but appropriations bills for the various different agencies and entities, to fund the various parts of the government instead of getting it all done in one big omnibus. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=197.0s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=210.0s)]
*  Got to pass the individual bills. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=211.0s)]
*  What happened this week? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=213.0s)]
*  So far, Republicans have tried to tee up two of those and then pulled them at the last minute. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=215.0s)]
*  Two separate must-pass bills to the floor got pulled. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=220.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=225.0s)]
*  Because they don't have the votes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=226.0s)]
*  They don't have the Republican votes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=227.0s)]
*  If this all sounds a little familiar, it's because it is exactly what started us down the road to begin with. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=230.0s)]
*  You might remember roughly two months ago when former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was trying to get funding bills passed before a looming shutdown deadline. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=236.0s)]
*  Vice its successor, McCarthy ran up against the basic problem at the heart of this narrow House Republican majority. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=244.0s)]
*  When it comes to like the actual real brass tax business of the U.S. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=251.0s)]
*  Congress funding the government at different levels for different programs and bureaus, there are two irreconcilable wings. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=255.0s)]
*  The Republican Party, whatever compromise you think you can come up with, you will face one group that will vote against you because they think you're spending too much or another group that will vote against you because they think you're not spending enough. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=262.0s)]
*  Meaning you cannot pass spending bills unilaterally on a party line vote with this Republican majority alone. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=275.0s)]
*  Just doesn't work mathematically. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=282.0s)]
*  This is a point the Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tried to stress to the News of House Speaker this week. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=284.0s)]
*  The only way let me say it a third time. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=292.0s)]
*  The only way we avoid a shutdown is with bipartisan cooperation, just as it was true in September and it will be true in the future. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=295.0s)]
*  I implore Speaker Johnson and our House Republican colleagues to learn from the fiasco of a month ago. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=304.0s)]
*  Yes, learn. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=310.0s)]
*  We went through this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=312.0s)]
*  Remember the debt ceiling thing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=313.0s)]
*  They worked out a deal with spending levels and then they tried to McCarthy and the House caucus were going to like undo that deal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=314.0s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=321.0s)]
*  You can't do it alone. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=322.0s)]
*  It is that simple. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=323.0s)]
*  If Speaker Johnson wants to keep the government open, he will need to reach across the aisle for Democratic votes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=324.0s)]
*  But if he does that, then he becomes a sellout. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=329.0s)]
*  The party fringe will say Johnson has betrayed the MAGA movement. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=334.0s)]
*  They will revolt against him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=337.0s)]
*  We know this, of course, because again, it just happened. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=339.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy could not keep the government funded with just Republican votes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=343.0s)]
*  So he made a deal with the White House and the Senate Democrats to keep it open for 45 days. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=346.0s)]
*  And he brought that up through a vote and it passed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=351.0s)]
*  Huge bipartisan majority, an extreme minority of his narrow majority, then fired him because of it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=353.0s)]
*  That compromise strategy is the only way to pass spending bills in the House. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=358.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson knows it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=363.0s)]
*  Everyone in leadership knows it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=365.0s)]
*  Everyone on Capitol Hill knows it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=367.0s)]
*  But if he does it, he runs the risk of being seen as having betrayed the conservative cause of not fighting enough, of being a sellout. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=369.0s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=376.0s)]
*  One speaker has already been fired. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=378.0s)]
*  At least three others failed to even come close to securing the gavel during that torturous three weeks. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=379.0s)]
*  And after 21 days of a speakerless House, this backbencher with no experience is now in charge. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=384.0s)]
*  And yet nothing has changed at all. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=389.0s)]
*  They're in exactly the same position they were back with McCarthy in September. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=392.0s)]
*  And instead of doing anything about that, they're taking symbolic votes to defund the folks who make sure there's no lead paint and toys. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=397.0s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat in Maryland. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=408.0s)]
*  He served on the January 6 committee. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=410.0s)]
*  He's now the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, and he joins me now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=412.0s)]
*  Am I did I get anything wrong there about the way this math works? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=416.0s)]
*  No, I think you got it all right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=423.0s)]
*  My my only caveat here is I don't know that the conflict within the GOP is between those who want to spend more and those who want to spend less. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=424.0s)]
*  As we saw during the Trump administration, they don't really care about that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah, deficits. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=436.0s)]
*  That all goes out the window. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=437.0s)]
*  What's really happening here is you have a kleptocrat, Donald Trump, who runs the GOP, and he's in it as family business. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=439.0s)]
*  He is a guy who does take one dollar for his salary annually when he's president. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=448.0s)]
*  Why? Because he's collecting tens of millions of dollars from the autocrats of the world. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=454.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Egypt, you name it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=459.0s)]
*  But how does a person like that form a working majority within the GOP? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=463.0s)]
*  The kleptocrats have to reach out to the theocrats. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=468.0s)]
*  And that's where Mike Johnson and the right wing white Christian nationalists come into it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=471.0s)]
*  And the problem is, is that those people really want to legislate anti-abortion, like Mike Johnson, whose position is no abortions in the country at all, with no exceptions for rape or incest. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=477.0s)]
*  And they start attaching like graffiti all of these anti-abortion amendments, all these homophobic, anti-gay amendments, anti-diversity equity inclusion. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=489.0s)]
*  And there are about a dozen Republicans left who are in non completely gerrymandered districts. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=499.0s)]
*  In other words, they're not in districts that have been drawn bright red in the image of Donald Trump and mega. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=506.0s)]
*  And so those people don't want to be voting to ban abortion in the District of Columbia. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=513.0s)]
*  They don't want to be bashing gay people, and they certainly don't want to be legislating against choice across the country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=519.0s)]
*  And that's the fix that they're in. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=525.0s)]
*  Those people's political future depends on moving away from mega. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=527.0s)]
*  But mega will only give their votes if they get that stuff. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=531.0s)]
*  OK, so that's super illuminating. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=534.0s)]
*  Like there's all these sort of poison pill culture war amendments they want to attach, and there's some group of the caucus that just can't vote for them. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=536.0s)]
*  But my understanding, too, is that basically those top line numbers for all the funding this year that was worked out in that debt ceiling deal between McCarthy and Biden and then the Senate, those are the numbers. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=543.0s)]
*  They're the numbers are working off in the Senate. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=554.0s)]
*  But there's a faction of the House that will think those numbers are too big and wants to cut. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=556.0s)]
*  And if they do that, the appropriators don't want to cut that much. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=560.0s)]
*  And so they they're irreconcilable. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=564.0s)]
*  Well, that's true, too. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=566.0s)]
*  There's a faction of the Freedom Caucus, the Chippewa people who will not vote for those numbers if it's a Democratic administration. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=569.0s)]
*  It's Trumpy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=577.0s)]
*  Of course, they'll vote for those numbers. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=578.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=580.0s)]
*  And much more inflated than that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=581.0s)]
*  But that's true. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=583.0s)]
*  In other words, they want to show that somehow they're slashing into the social budget. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=585.0s)]
*  They, you know, they want to cut snap benefits. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=589.0s)]
*  You know, they want to dismantle anything the government does that doesn't directly benefit Donald Trump and that doesn't directly benefit them in the corporations that they serve. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=593.0s)]
*  So that's a problem, too. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=604.0s)]
*  What we've got is a rule or ruin mentality. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=606.0s)]
*  Either Trump is going to be in and he's going to rule all the way to the point of dictating who gets prosecuted and who doesn't. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=609.0s)]
*  And we already saw with Roger Stone sentencing, for example, how micro he wants to get in terms of telling the Department of Justice what to do. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=615.0s)]
*  Or if they can't rule, they're just going to ruin everything. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=624.0s)]
*  They'll shut the government down. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=627.0s)]
*  They'll impeach Joe Biden for absolutely nothing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=628.0s)]
*  They'll just be a wrecking ball against Democratic purposes. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=631.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think the main story here is sort of the personalities at issue or their experience. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=635.0s)]
*  I don't think the most gifted legislator in the world, Nancy Pelosi, for example, if she was trying to sort of whip this caucus would have that much success. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=641.0s)]
*  But I also do think that one of the things I've learned in my life is like, you know, there's certain technique and expertise that comes with any craft, whether you're building cabinets or you're you're teaching kids. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=647.0s)]
*  You're working as a crossing guard for serving food. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=659.0s)]
*  And that sure as heck is true for like trying to get a caucus together. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=662.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=665.0s)]
*  Like, it just seems like of all the people to try to do this, you know, you've served in Congress like that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=666.0s)]
*  He doesn't. He's starting from zero on the task at hand. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=672.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, there are complicated rules and traditions and relationships that actually govern the real legislative process. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=676.0s)]
*  But, you know, someone like Mike Johnson says the Bible comes first over the Constitution, then the Constitution and then the laws and the rules and the regulations. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=685.0s)]
*  And by the time you get down there, it's too late. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=694.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, they're sending us something. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=696.0s)]
*  I don't even know what it is. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=699.0s)]
*  A few days before the government is about to shut down, they don't have respect for the actual legislative process. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=701.0s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, thank you so much for your time. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=708.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=711.0s)]
*  At least 40 journalists have been killed since the Hamas attacks on October 7th and the Israeli campaign in response. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=714.0s)]
*  Thirty five in Gaza alone during that Israeli response. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=720.0s)]
*  It's according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which notes this is the highest total of any recent conflict. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=724.0s)]
*  It led to, quote, the deadliest month for journalists since they began gathering data in 1992. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=731.0s)]
*  Last week, one Palestinian reporter broke down as he learned of the loss of his colleague live on the air. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=737.0s)]
*  Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world to be a journalist right now. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=767.0s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=777.0s)]
*  And since no foreign journalists are allowed in, unless they are embedded with the Israeli army, these local journalists, often employed as freelancers by Western media, are the eyes and ears of the world. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=779.0s)]
*  So it's incredibly distressing when an Israeli group called Honest Reporting circulated the names and at least one case pictures of local Palestinian journalists who documented the Hamas attack and all but outright accused them of having foreign knowledge of the attack itself and being collaborators in it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=789.0s)]
*  Those accusations were amplified and spread all over social media. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=804.0s)]
*  Some outlets like CNN chose to cut ties with one of the freelancers after Honest Reporting surfaced an old photo of him with Hamas' leader, though we don't know the context. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=808.0s)]
*  Others, like the New York Times, whose freelance contributor was targeted, issued a strong rebuke, quote, the accusation that any one of the New York Times had advanced knowledge of the Hamas attacks or accompanied Hamas terrorists during the attacks is untrue and outrageous. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=817.0s)]
*  It is reckless to make such allegations, putting our journalists on the ground in Israel and Gaza at risk. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=831.0s)]
*  We also want to speak in defense of freelance photojournalists working in conflict areas whose jobs often require them to rush into danger to provide firsthand witness accounts and to document important news. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=837.0s)]
*  This is the essential role of a free press in wartime. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=847.0s)]
*  But since that implication, several prominent Israeli politicians warned that journalists who knew about the attack would be treated like terrorists that is targeted for violence. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=851.0s)]
*  Those voices include War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=860.0s)]
*  Even Republican Senator Tom Cotten of Arkansas jumped in on the whole thing, writing a letter to the New York Times with a veiled thread about employees of the newspaper facing criminal prosecution, citing those reports that their journalists were embedded with Hamas. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=864.0s)]
*  And then last night, through the Associated Press, we learned that Honest Reporting, the group making these claims, quote, had no evidence to back it up, the suggestion that any of the journalists were, it implied where Hamas collaborators had any foreknowledge of the attacks. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=877.0s)]
*  In the context of the worst death toll of working reporters I've seen in my life, this is unfathomably reckless from everyone involved. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=892.0s)]
*  The reason war reporting is so crucially important is because, as the old cliche goes, truth is the first casualty of war. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=900.0s)]
*  In the era of social media, this takes on new meaning as we are subjected to an endless stream of images and information and propaganda. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=909.0s)]
*  Take one notable example. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=916.0s)]
*  Hamas leadership in interview after interview was either gamely tried to deny their own atrocities on October 7th or seeded false stories. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=917.0s)]
*  The head of Hezbollah recently gave a speech where he claimed that it was Israeli soldiers who killed their own citizen, that they were the ones really responsible for what happened. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=925.0s)]
*  That and other conspiracy theories have now predictably blossomed online with all the attendant grainy video and the like. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=935.0s)]
*  But the atrocities committed by Hamas are undeniable, not just because of the eyewitness accounts to them, but also because Hamas made sure that seemingly everyone committing the atrocity recorded it for posterity. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=942.0s)]
*  Though there will be those who dispute the slaughter, the slaughter is not in dispute. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=953.0s)]
*  There will be those who dispute the abject misery and death of Gaza's people, but that is not in dispute. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=958.0s)]
*  In fact, earlier this week, a senior Biden administration official said the death toll of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip is likely far higher than the 10,000 being reported by the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=965.0s)]
*  Journalism at its best makes us reckon with terrible truths and among the many, many, many lies worthy of mourning in this war. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=977.0s)]
*  I want to honor those fellow members of our profession who have paid the ultimate price while bearing witness for all of us. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=985.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXjqnPvgKg&t=995.0s)]
