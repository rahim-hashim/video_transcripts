# Lieu blasts ‘dumb’ Durham hearing Republicans focused on ‘stupid stuff’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0)
*  Tonight's party line vote by Republicans to censure a colleague who led the first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=0.0s)]
*  impeachment of the ex-president and expressed his belief that it was likely that Trump had [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=4.0s)]
*  in fact colluded with Russia is just another example of how the right wing tries to chip [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=7.32s)]
*  away at the truth until they've sculpted a lie into stone. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=11.6s)]
*  They tried to do it the 2020 election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=15.56s)]
*  They've really tried to do it and had some success with COVID lockdowns. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=17.32s)]
*  Oh, they were a failure. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=19.92s)]
*  Oh, they were necessary. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=20.92s)]
*  And they have tried to do it and had some success with the Mueller investigation into [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=22.44s)]
*  Russian sabotage of the 2016 election. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=26.34s)]
*  As part of that effort, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony from, as we mentioned, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  John Durham this morning, the special counsel appointed under Donald Trump to investigate [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=32.72s)]
*  the people who tried to investigate what Russia did in that election. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=37.16s)]
*  But Congressman Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, was having none of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=44.68s)]
*  Now, Mr. Durham, I'd like to ask you the following simple yes or no questions. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=45.68s)]
*  Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted, correct? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=50.44s)]
*  I'm sorry, could you just repeat that one? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=53.84s)]
*  Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted, correct? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=55.36s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=59.08s)]
*  Trump's former foreign policy advisor to the campaign, George Papadopoulos, was convicted, correct? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=60.08s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=64.48s)]
*  Trump's former deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, was convicted, correct? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=65.48s)]
*  Not in connection with the Russian map. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=70.16s)]
*  Mr. Durham, you can hold yourself out as an objective Department of Justice official or [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=72.04s)]
*  as a partisan hack. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  And the more that you try to spin the facts and not answer my questions, you sound like [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=80.44s)]
*  the latter. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=84.12s)]
*  So I'm just going to ask this simply. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=85.12s)]
*  Trump's former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, was convicted, correct? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=87.12s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=91.12s)]
*  Trump's longtime advisor, Roger Stone, was convicted, correct? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=92.68s)]
*  I'm sorry, I missed the last thing you mentioned. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump's longtime advisor, Roger Stone, was convicted, correct? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=100.44s)]
*  In contrast to multiple Trump associates who were convicted, you brought two cases to jury [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=101.44s)]
*  trial based on this investigation and you lost both. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=105.72s)]
*  And so I don't actually know what we're doing here because the author of the Durham report [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=108.68s)]
*  that the FBI had enough information to investigate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=114.0s)]
*  And thank goodness the FBI did because multiple Trump associates who committed crimes were [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=120.12s)]
*  held accountable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=125.04s)]
*  And the best way to summarize what happened is thank you to the brave men and women of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=126.04s)]
*  the FBI for doing their jobs. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=131.68s)]
*  And Congressman Liu joins me now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=134.16s)]
*  Congressman, what was your understanding of the purpose of today's hearing, Mr. Durham? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=136.68s)]
*  Thank you, Chris, for your question. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me first say when Democrats control the House, we pass laws like the infrastructure [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=144.2s)]
*  law to help American families to grow our economy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  And when Republicans control, what do we get? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=153.28s)]
*  We get stupid stuff like this dumb hearing on a Durham report, which concluded after [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=155.56s)]
*  wasting $6 million in taxpayers' money that the FBI had a duty to investigate allegations [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  of Trump-Roger collusion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=168.56s)]
*  Thank goodness FBI did that because multiple Trump associates were convicted and held accountable [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  for their crimes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  One of the themes today was frustration from Republicans, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=178.1s)]
*  The Durham's investigation, his report and the two cases he brought, which you referenced, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=183.1s)]
*  both of which ended in acquittals, quite notably, didn't come up with more. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  Matt Gaetz tweeting Durham is part of the cover up and then telling Durham to his face he [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=192.22s)]
*  was like the Washington generals. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=197.38s)]
*  Take a look at this exchange. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=199.82s)]
*  You didn't charge Andrew McCabe. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=203.66s)]
*  You didn't convict the lion Democrats or the lion Russians. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  You didn't investigate Mifsud or the Mueller probe, even though, as we sit here today in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  black letter, that was your charge. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=212.82s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the Washington generals? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=215.98s)]
*  The Washington generals, yes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  And they're the team that basically gets paid to show up and lose, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=220.34s)]
*  What do you take away from the frustration of folks like Gaetz and others with Durham [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=225.82s)]
*  and what Durham produced? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=230.66s)]
*  Mega Republicans are trying to rewrite history and we cannot let them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=233.26s)]
*  The facts are very clear. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=237.9s)]
*  The Department of Justice, through the Mueller report, found that the Russians interfered [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=239.58s)]
*  in our elections in 2016 in a sweeping and systematic fashion. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=244.26s)]
*  A bipartisan U.S. Senate report in 2020 concluded the Russians interfered and it was designed [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=249.4s)]
*  to benefit Donald Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=255.44s)]
*  And then Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, admitted that he gave internal Trump campaign [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  data to the Russians. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=263.04s)]
*  That is called Russian collusion. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=265.64s)]
*  It was interesting to me to watch the basic facts of that be reset because I do think [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=268.68s)]
*  it's been, even though the Durham report I don't think has been particularly effective, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=273.0s)]
*  I do think William Barr's massaging of the report, his control of its release, was relatively [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=276.84s)]
*  effective in obscuring a bit of just the depths of what was found by the Senate Intelligence [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  Committee by Mueller, which is basically, I think, you know, not debated, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  The sweep of the Russian effort to tip the election, the obvious openness on the part [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  of the Trump campaign, the welcoming of that help both publicly and privately through the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=297.68s)]
*  sun and the actual sort of two fingers touching in the giving of that information to Konstantin [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Kalimnik, who is assessed to be an asset of Russian intelligence. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=308.04s)]
*  Do you think they've been successful in rewriting that history? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=312.54s)]
*  I do not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=316.94s)]
*  We do know that the American public rose up and fired Donald Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=318.26000000000005s)]
*  And I think part of it is people were concerned about his ties to Russia and his campaign's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=323.12s)]
*  ties to Russia. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=329.72s)]
*  And what we see now with this indictment of Donald Trump from Department of Justice is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=331.44s)]
*  that he also had all these classified documents. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=336.32s)]
*  And why would he keep these top secret documents and not give them back? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=339.48s)]
*  It's all very suspicious. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=343.32s)]
*  Adam Schiff today was censured along party line votes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=345.08s)]
*  What is your assessment of the full day starting with Durham ending in that censure vote and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  why they chose to make him, I believe, the third member censured this century in a body [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=354.36s)]
*  that has seen multiple felons and currently includes George Santos. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=359.2s)]
*  So again, how does this move the American family forward? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=364.26000000000005s)]
*  How does this grow our economy? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=367.3s)]
*  I note that the author of this censor resolution, Representative Luna, has introduced a total [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=369.26000000000005s)]
*  of six bills in her entire career, five of them, or about Adam Schiff. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=374.26000000000005s)]
*  That's rather obsessive. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=380.94000000000005s)]
*  And this strange obsession that the Republicans have with doing stupid stuff, none of this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=382.94000000000005s)]
*  is helping grow our economy or moving the American family forward. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMhQ3QAtkP0&t=387.94000000000005s)]
