# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 14
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It was a chaotic and oddly violent day on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=0.0s)]
*  where Republicans' dysfunction, stunts, and anger are becoming more and more extreme. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=6.0s)]
*  Now, ironically, this all happened amidst what should be a real success for House Republicans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=10.0s)]
*  Their new speaker, Mike Johnson, Louisiana, just managed to pass a continuing resolution [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=16.0s)]
*  funding the government until early next year. That avoids a looming shutdown. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=21.0s)]
*  That's good, you think, but crucially, more Democrats voted for that measure than members of Johnson's own party. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=26.0s)]
*  As Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News put it, Democrats saved him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=33.0s)]
*  Dangerous territory for Republican speaker, see McCarthy, Kevin. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=37.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson learned pretty quickly the lesson that the only way to keep the government functioning, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=41.0s)]
*  something we've been saying throughout, right, is to basically ignore part of his own caucus and to work with Democrats. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=47.0s)]
*  And that decision today, and the kind of oddly anticlimactic vote in Congress along the lines we all knew it would happen, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=53.0s)]
*  that may have something to do with the rage that emerged all over Capitol Hill today in an environment [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=60.0s)]
*  that Speaker Johnson himself described as a, quote, pressure cooker. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=65.0s)]
*  And the first and most notable incident involved Mike Johnson's predecessor. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=69.0s)]
*  Remember that guy? That's the former Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, turfed out over a month ago. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=74.0s)]
*  This morning, in clear view of at least one report, McCarthy appears to have assaulted a member of his own GOP conference. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=79.0s)]
*  NPR congressional correspondent, Claudia Grisales, posted this firsthand account, quote, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=88.0s)]
*  have never seen this on Capitol Hill. While talking, Congressman Tim Burchette, after the Republican conference meeting, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=94.0s)]
*  former Speaker McCarthy walked by with his detail and McCarthy shoved Burchette. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=101.0s)]
*  Burchette lunged towards me. I thought it was a joke. It was not, and a chase ensued. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=107.0s)]
*  Grisales also recorded the audio of the interaction, which I'm going to play you in full. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=113.0s)]
*  Before I do that, a warning. All of the clips, lowlights that are going to play you from the Hill today are just so, so cringy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=118.0s)]
*  You're going to want to turn away at first, but it's also just such a wild window into what's going on there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=126.0s)]
*  I think you will not want to take your eyes and ears off them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=133.0s)]
*  So this is what happened when Kevin McCarthy exited that meeting and encountered Tim Burchette of Tennessee in the hallway. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=136.0s)]
*  I think it went all right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=143.0s)]
*  Sorry, Kevin. Didn't mean to elbow. Why did you elbow me in the back, Kevin? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=151.0s)]
*  Hey, Kevin, you got any guts? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=156.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=161.0s)]
*  You got no guts. You did so. They said there and the reporter said it right there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=181.0s)]
*  What kind of chicken move is that? You're you're pathetic, man. You are so pathetic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=185.0s)]
*  What a jerk. You need security, Kevin. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=196.0s)]
*  Anyway, short while later, Bursch it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=206.0s)]
*  Bursch it explained that what happened in more detail, telling reporters he believed the assault was intentional. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=209.0s)]
*  I was standing in the hall. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=216.0s)]
*  And Kevin McCarthy walked by elbowed me in the kidneys as he walked by. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=219.0s)]
*  And I kind of caught me off guard. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=226.0s)]
*  You ever get shot? Shot in the kidneys. It's a little different than anywhere else. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=229.0s)]
*  And so I moved forward. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=234.0s)]
*  You felt it was on purpose and not an accident? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=237.0s)]
*  Oh, it was 100 percent on purpose, ma'am. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=240.0s)]
*  It's 435 members of Congress paid up as voters against me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=242.0s)]
*  I'm the one who did it. I'm one of them who did it. He publicly called me out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=246.0s)]
*  He didn't see any cameras. He didn't think anybody was paying attention. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=251.0s)]
*  He thought the Claudia from NPR was paying attention. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=254.0s)]
*  Now, for his part, McCarthy denied the whole thing, claiming it was a tight area where they may have bumped shoulders by accident. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=257.0s)]
*  Did you elbow him? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=264.0s)]
*  No, I did not elbow him. No, I would not elbow him. I would not hit him in the kidney. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=265.0s)]
*  HC5, you're all down there, right? Not a very big hallway. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=270.0s)]
*  So I'm walking out. You can talk to Bruce Westman, because I actually called him after you guys reported something. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=273.0s)]
*  Did I hit somebody? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=278.0s)]
*  Bruce Westman and I are walking out. I guess a reporter was interviewing Bursch it or something. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=280.0s)]
*  I guess our shoulders hit because Bursch it runs up to me after I didn't know what he was talking about. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=285.0s)]
*  Some reporters asked me. I did not run and hit the guy. I did not kidney punch him. I did not shoot anything like that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=288.0s)]
*  You didn't shove him? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=294.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=295.0s)]
*  But reporters are witnesses that it looked like there was plenty of room for you to walk and that you intentionally hit him. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=296.0s)]
*  There is. OK, not a place. Show me a reporter who saw that. Call Bruce Westman. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=300.0s)]
*  A couple of them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=305.0s)]
*  Ask Bruce Westman. No, I did not go up. If I would hit somebody, they would know I hit him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=306.0s)]
*  He said he was in pain that you hit him so hard in the kidneys. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=311.0s)]
*  Oh, come on now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=316.0s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=317.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=318.0s)]
*  Now, that explanation was met with quite a bit of skepticism, especially in light of the recent accusation by former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger that McCarthy shoved him on two occasions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=319.0s)]
*  I just take a second to think about how insane this is. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=329.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy is alleged to and in view of a reporter appears to have like elbowed in the kidney a colleague he was mad at. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=332.0s)]
*  That is a wild thing to do. A grown man in a workplace. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=342.0s)]
*  Can you imagine doing that in your place of work anywhere? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=348.0s)]
*  Congress and Matt Gates of Florida never one to see a news cycle go by without joining it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=352.0s)]
*  File this request for a House Ethics Committee investigation into kidney punch gate today. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=357.0s)]
*  Then on the other side of Capitol Hill, we're not done here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=364.0s)]
*  We almost saw another confrontation come to blows. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=368.0s)]
*  This one took place in the middle of a health, education, labor and pension committee hearing when Republican Senator Mark Wayne Mullen of Oklahoma brought up brought up his online beef. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=371.0s)]
*  With the witness, the president of Teamsters Labor Union, Sean O'Brien, Chairman Bernie Sanders had to step in. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=381.0s)]
*  Pretends like he's self-made. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=388.0s)]
*  What a clown fraud always has been, always will be. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=391.0s)]
*  Quit the tough guy act and the Senate hearings. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=397.0s)]
*  You know where to find me. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=401.0s)]
*  Any place, any time cowboy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=402.0s)]
*  Sir, this is a time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=405.0s)]
*  This is a place. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=407.0s)]
*  You want to run your mouth. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=408.0s)]
*  We can be too consenting adults. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=409.0s)]
*  We can finish it here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=411.0s)]
*  OK, that's fine. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=412.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=413.0s)]
*  You want to do it now? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=414.0s)]
*  I'd love to do it right now. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=415.0s)]
*  Let's stand your butt up then. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=416.0s)]
*  You stand your butt up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=417.0s)]
*  Oh, hold on. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=418.0s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=419.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=420.0s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=421.0s)]
*  You're a United States Senator. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=422.0s)]
*  OK, sit down, please. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=425.0s)]
*  You're a United States Senator. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=428.0s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=432.0s)]
*  Sit down. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=433.0s)]
*  You're a United States Senator. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=434.0s)]
*  That senator, by the way, former mixed martial arts fighter, refused to back down. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=435.0s)]
*  He kept trying to set a place and time for the physical altercation between the two men. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=440.0s)]
*  You said any time, any place. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=446.0s)]
*  What's your question? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=448.0s)]
*  Accept the challenge. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=449.0s)]
*  What challenge? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=450.0s)]
*  You said any time, any place. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=451.0s)]
*  I'm accepting yours, so why don't you come back? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=453.0s)]
*  What challenge? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=455.0s)]
*  What challenge are you talking about? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=456.0s)]
*  April 30th. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=457.0s)]
*  How about we do it for charity at the Smoking Guns in Tulsa, Oklahoma? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=458.0s)]
*  We're not going to be talking about physical confrontations here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=461.0s)]
*  You want to fight me? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=464.0s)]
*  What do you say by any time, any place? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=465.0s)]
*  Let's have coffee, discuss our differences. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=467.0s)]
*  Oh, that's what you said. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=469.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=470.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=471.0s)]
*  All right, let's say I don't have coffee. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=472.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=473.0s)]
*  I'd love to. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=474.0s)]
*  It's funny how you're backing out. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=475.0s)]
*  I don't back on anything. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=476.0s)]
*  You did. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=477.0s)]
*  You're the one. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=478.0s)]
*  You're a 100, should be the most influential people in this country making changes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=479.0s)]
*  You're focused on debate that's not even relevant. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=482.0s)]
*  You're an embarrassment. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=486.0s)]
*  When he was asked about the wisdom of using violence to solve a dispute, Mullen pointed [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=488.0s)]
*  to the long history of fighting in the nation's capital. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=493.0s)]
*  But what about, I mean, just the idea that fighting as a way to solve a problem, is that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=497.0s)]
*  kind of, are you concerned that that's the way the conversation is happening here in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=501.0s)]
*  Capitol Hill? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=505.0s)]
*  People's been fighting for a long time. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=506.0s)]
*  Go back to the 1800s, they used to have canines. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=508.0s)]
*  It was legal to do duels. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=510.0s)]
*  If you have a difference, you have a difference. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=512.0s)]
*  I didn't start it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=514.0s)]
*  I didn't tweet it to him. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=515.0s)]
*  I didn't go after him. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=516.0s)]
*  I have no beef with a guy. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=517.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know the last time I've gotten a street fight. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=518.0s)]
*  I used to get paid to fight. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=520.0s)]
*  I'm not looking. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=522.0s)]
*  What do I have? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=523.0s)]
*  What victory is it for me to beat up O'Brien? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=524.0s)]
*  That would be a shock, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=526.0s)]
*  But he said it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=529.0s)]
*  And I just simply responded. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=531.0s)]
*  If he wants to call it off and we just go have a cup of coffee, fine, let's say I don't [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=533.0s)]
*  have a cup of coffee. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=536.0s)]
*  I have no part in it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=537.0s)]
*  It's not personal to me. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=538.0s)]
*  He just challenged me, and I accepted the challenge. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=539.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, Mullen is not wrong about the history of violence on the House floor. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=542.0s)]
*  There's an incredible book about this, came out a few years ago. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=546.0s)]
*  But the caning he referred to, which is the infamous caning of Charles Sumner, the abolitionist [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=548.0s)]
*  senator from Massachusetts who was beaten near death by a pro-slavery advocate from [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=553.0s)]
*  the House on the floor of the Senate, is widely considered to be like the turning point of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=559.0s)]
*  no return past which a war between the states and a civil war was inevitable. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=565.0s)]
*  Believe it or not, what I played you there with Markway and Mullen and Sean O'Brien was [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=571.0s)]
*  not even the only hearing where we saw a Republican member of Congress up on the dais [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=576.0s)]
*  microphone explode today. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=582.0s)]
*  Now, there's another one. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=583.0s)]
*  All same day. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=584.0s)]
*  I'm just giving you today's recap, okay? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=585.0s)]
*  This Tuesday, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer could not contain his anger when [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=587.0s)]
*  he was confronted by Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz about a report that Comer [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=593.0s)]
*  made a $200,000 business deal with his brother. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=598.0s)]
*  Now, that comes amidst Comer's accusations about President Biden's business dealing [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=602.0s)]
*  with his own brother, James, when, crucially, Biden was out of office. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=606.0s)]
*  Never loan my brother money. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=611.0s)]
*  Don't have an LLC. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=615.0s)]
*  But you and Goldman, who is Mr. Trust Fund, continue to try to... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=618.0s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=623.0s)]
*  No, I'm not going to give you your time back. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=624.0s)]
*  We can stop the clock. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=626.0s)]
*  You all continue to... [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=628.0s)]
*  You look like a smurf here, just going around and all this stuff. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=630.0s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, you have... [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=634.0s)]
*  No, no, hold on. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=636.0s)]
*  If we're not on time, we can... [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=637.0s)]
*  You have gone on TV and said the president did something illegal. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=639.0s)]
*  You're doing stuff with your brother. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=643.0s)]
*  The American people have the same questions. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=645.0s)]
*  Why should they believe you? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=647.0s)]
*  Why should they believe you? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=649.0s)]
*  Why should they believe you? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=651.0s)]
*  There's a different rule for the president. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=652.0s)]
*  There's a different rule for you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=654.0s)]
*  Why should they believe what you're saying, Mr. Chairman? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=655.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=657.0s)]
*  Now, all this is kind of the ridiculousness we've come to expect from Republican members of this conference. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=659.0s)]
*  On a deeper level, though, these incidents really highlight the fact that the Republican Party, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=666.0s)]
*  Congressional Republican Party specifically, don't have really unifying governing vision. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=670.0s)]
*  There's no project they're engaged in other than, like, being the praetorian guard for Donald Trump's takeover of the U.S. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=675.0s)]
*  government, but there's no project they're doing together. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=684.0s)]
*  There's nothing that really binds them together. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=687.0s)]
*  Crucially also, this is a reminder that it is the party whose de facto leader endorses, cultivates political violence, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=689.0s)]
*  the rhetoric that led to a violent coup on the Capitol. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=696.0s)]
*  He makes, like, cute jokes about it when Nancy Pelosi's husband gets savagely assaulted. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=699.0s)]
*  That's, like, a punchline for him. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=705.0s)]
*  That's the political movement that they're part of. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=707.0s)]
*  So it's disconcerting to see members of that party actually assaulting, apparently, other members of Congress less than three years later. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=710.0s)]
*  What was President Trump's reaction when, I guess, this cadre of advisors would say, you lost? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=719.0s)]
*  It was like, well, they would say that and then they'd walk out and he'd go see, this is what I deal with all the time. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=728.0s)]
*  Former Trump attorney Sidney Powell is one of the four former defendants in the Georgia Rico case who have already pleaded guilty [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=737.0s)]
*  and who spoke to prosecutors as part of their plea agreements. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=744.0s)]
*  The Washington Post obtained tapes of all four, including attorney Kenneth Chesbrough, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=748.0s)]
*  and reports that his statement to prosecutors could provide evidence that Trump was aware of the fake elector plan. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=753.0s)]
*  Chesbrough disclosed that he previously unreported White House meeting. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=759.0s)]
*  He briefed Trump on election challenges in Arizona and summarized a memo in which he offered advice on assembling alternate slates of electors, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=762.0s)]
*  key battlegrounds to cast ballots for Trump despite Biden's victories in those states. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=769.0s)]
*  Joining me now is MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=774.0s)]
*  Let's start on that because as someone who has spent a lot of time on the facts around January 6th will lead up to it, the coup, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=777.0s)]
*  I think, and I might be wrong because it's an enormous amount of information, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=784.0s)]
*  we have never had Chesbrough in the room with Donald Trump, directly telling him anything until that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=788.0s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=795.0s)]
*  And that for me was the biggest revelation of all of this, that Chesbrough was in the room with Trump. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=796.0s)]
*  The date of the meeting is, of course, two days after all of the electors, fake and otherwise, are convening. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=802.0s)]
*  So that work is already behind Chesbrough at that point. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=809.0s)]
*  He's already directed everything from the press releases to the forms that these fake electors are supposed to sign to each of the different states. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=812.0s)]
*  But the other thing I found so interesting was not only was he in the room with Trump, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=821.0s)]
*  but when asked who he coordinated his activities with, who is the person he said he communicated with the most? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=825.0s)]
*  It's not Rudy. It's not John Eastman. It's Boris. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=830.0s)]
*  Right. And you and I have talked many times about the fact that Boris has really escaped being a central figure here. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=834.0s)]
*  He's not charged in the Fulton County indictment. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=840.0s)]
*  He is allegedly one of the co-conspirators in the D.C. federal election interference case, but reported only by the New York Times and unconfirmed. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=842.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=851.0s)]
*  Unconfirmed by NBC News and any other outlet as far as I know. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=852.0s)]
*  Right. So Chesbrough is basically putting Boris at the center, right, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=856.0s)]
*  as the connective tissue between the functionaries who are carrying out the fake elector plot. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=861.0s)]
*  And Trump is also a really interesting feature of the proffer that he gave to Fulton County investigators. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=867.0s)]
*  And this is of course Boris Epstein, who is, I guess, technically is an attorney, right? He's a lawyer. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=873.0s)]
*  He's technically an attorney. He's apparently functioning as sort of a coordinating counsel. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=878.0s)]
*  Yes. And when asked about who's quarterbacking this, Chesbrough said, oh, that was Boris, which was interesting. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=882.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=887.0s)]
*  Jenna Ellis also, I mean, nothing quite new there, although I think it probably helps in pushing back on advice of counsel defense, maybe. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=888.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it well, to what extent Jenna Ellis said those things that she said to Scavino to Trump, I think is still remains to be seen. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=897.0s)]
*  However, the other thing that really struck me about that conversation that Jenna Ellis says took place on December 19th. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=908.0s)]
*  He's not leaving. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=914.0s)]
*  That he's not leaving and that the we in terms of the people backing up the boss included not only Scavino, but Meadows. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=915.0s)]
*  That was the tail end of that statement. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=923.0s)]
*  Yep. Right. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=925.0s)]
*  But the other thing that strikes me about it is Jenna Ellis's behavior after that date, as evidenced by her own tweets, is not reflective of a person who thought that Trump should leave office gracefully. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=926.0s)]
*  Rather, she's urging people and urging Donald Trump himself not to concede the election. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=938.0s)]
*  Right. On December 28th, she's putting pressure. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=944.0s)]
*  December 28th, 2020, President Trump should never concede the election. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=946.0s)]
*  January 5th, one day before the 6th, more than 100 state legislators asked Pence to delay certification electoral votes. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=948.0s)]
*  Great. So if this is the same Jenna Ellis who allegedly told Dan Scavino, what do you mean he's not leaving? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=954.0s)]
*  That's not the way it's supposed to work. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=960.0s)]
*  That's not the way loyal Jenna Ellis was behaving in public as evidenced by her social media posts. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=962.0s)]
*  And finally, in terms of, I mean, it was wild to get these videos. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=969.0s)]
*  I don't think anyone was expecting it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=973.0s)]
*  Clearly, finding Willis not happy, protective order. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=974.0s)]
*  There's an addendum to it in the end, which seems to flag exactly where they came from. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=976.0s)]
*  Yes. And, you know, Harrison Floyd's lawyers taking responsibility in an email responding to Steve Sato, the former president's lawyer, basically saying, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=981.0s)]
*  everybody should tell us on the record whether they did this or not. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=990.0s)]
*  It didn't come from us. We're concerned about it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=993.0s)]
*  DA's office says definitely didn't come from us. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=995.0s)]
*  And then Harrison Floyd's lawyer, it came from Harrison Floyd's team. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh8Lm3zB_A&t=998.0s)]
