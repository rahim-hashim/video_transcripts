# Warnock We saw Jan. 6 ‘metastasize into voter suppression laws’ across America
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg)
*  In many ways, Georgia is ground zero in the battle for American democracy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=0.0s)]
*  A true 50-50 state, Biden's narrow win in 2020 was the first time a Democrat carried [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=4.16s)]
*  that state since Clinton. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=9.28s)]
*  The Biden victory inspired then-President Trump to try and corruptly overturn the election [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=11.22s)]
*  in Georgia, a scheme he was just invited for federally, along with the other states that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  he tried to do it, and for which he faces another potential indictment this month in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=20.48s)]
*  Georgia itself. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=24.0s)]
*  And while Trump's efforts failed, state Republicans were able to force through some of the most [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=26.12s)]
*  restrictive voter suppression rules in the country in the aftermath. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=29.98s)]
*  Additionally, Georgia has held three of the most hotly contested Senate races in the country [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=33.9s)]
*  in just two years, with Democrats prevailing in all three races, thanks in large part to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=39.06s)]
*  this man, Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won two of those races, actually, really, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=43.4s)]
*  four of them when you count the runoffs, in just two years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=49.66s)]
*  And Senator Reverend Warnock joins me now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=53.1s)]
*  He is the author of the book, A Way Out of No Way, A Memoir of Truth Transformation and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=55.34s)]
*  the New American Story. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=59.34s)]
*  Senator, first, let's just start. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=61.220000000000006s)]
*  Fulton County, I believe, is where you call home and is the place where there may be some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  activity legally. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=71.86s)]
*  Fannie Willis has talked about the kind of threat she's gotten today. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=73.7s)]
*  The ex-president called her a racist. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=76.62s)]
*  Are you concerned at all about the atmosphere being directed at the machinery of justice [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=78.86s)]
*  in your home state? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, great to be with you, Chris. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  We are watching the wills of jurisprudence turn here in the state of Georgia and in our [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  country, and I think it's important for everybody to honor that process. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=96.94000000000001s)]
*  The ex-president, sadly, is doing what we've seen him do time and time again. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=102.14s)]
*  I have confidence in our local officials here, and I'll be doing everything I can at the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=106.54s)]
*  federal level to ensure that they have the resources necessary to keep everybody safe [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=112.52s)]
*  while we honor that basic American principle, equal protection under the law. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=118.16s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  No one is below the law, and that applies to the ex-president. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=123.44s)]
*  There has been a lot of scrutiny of Georgia, both its politics, because it has become such [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  a hotly contested swing state. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  It has had some of the highest profile races in the entire country, including the four [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=134.04s)]
*  races that you ran in the course of two years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=138.76s)]
*  Actually, it was five, Chris, but who's counting? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=142.72s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  So how would you rate the state's democratic health, having emerged victorious in the state, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  being the first black senator from that state, how would you rate its democratic health? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=154.56s)]
*  Well, I'm honored that the people of Georgia have sent me to the United States Senate to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=162.6s)]
*  represent them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=166.52s)]
*  But make no mistake, we are in a real fight for our democracy here in this country, and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=167.52s)]
*  Georgia is ground zero. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=175.8s)]
*  The fact that the people of Georgia overcame those barriers in order to send me and my [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=177.68s)]
*  partner John Ossoff to the Senate doesn't mean those barriers don't exist. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  It just means that the people refuse to have their voices muted in the system. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=190.12s)]
*  And so what we saw in the days after my election is the violent assault on the Capitol metastasized [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=194.48s)]
*  then into voter suppression laws all across our country throughout the body politic. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=204.12s)]
*  Some 400 voter suppression laws introduced in the year 2021, right after my election, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=210.28s)]
*  and then this year some 300 voter suppression laws. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=218.66s)]
*  And Georgia's SB 202 is exhibit A, if you will, of the problem, this effort to somehow [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=223.02s)]
*  wage war against this multiracial new American electorate that is emerging in our country [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=233.14s)]
*  and in our state and defending everything from voting rights to reproductive rights [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=240.0s)]
*  to ensuring that jobs and opportunity are available to every kid regardless of their zip code. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=248.02s)]
*  In terms of SB 202, I think people, the defenders of the law, and some I think, and not specifically [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=252.02s)]
*  people who are that keyed in, say look, this was law passed with certain restrictions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=259.18s)]
*  It got a lot of attention after January 6th because it was passed in 2021. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=265.3s)]
*  It was decried by critics as an attempt at voter suppression. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=270.9s)]
*  So look, you got elected. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=274.82s)]
*  Elections are running well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  Were you crying wolf about this law? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=280.58s)]
*  Listen, I won this last time, but people need to understand what I had to go through the win. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=283.74s)]
*  Just as we entered into the runoff this second time, there were some folks who clearly took a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=291.46s)]
*  look at how we won in the last runoff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=297.74s)]
*  They cut the runoff in half from eight weeks to four weeks. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  And as we entered the runoff, the secretary of state and other Georgia officials announced [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=304.86s)]
*  that we wouldn't be able to vote on the first Saturday of the runoff. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=310.22s)]
*  And they were misinterpreting some Georgia law and saying, we're sorry, our hands are tied. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=315.82000000000005s)]
*  You can't vote that first Saturday. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=321.38000000000005s)]
*  Well, since they said their hands were tied, I decided to untie their hands. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=322.82000000000005s)]
*  I sued them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  And we won the case. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=328.3s)]
*  And then the folks who said their hands were tied then showed their hands and appealed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=330.58s)]
*  the judge's ruling who said, yeah, you can vote on Saturday. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=334.58s)]
*  And then we had to appeal again. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=337.78s)]
*  All of that just so people could vote the first Saturday of the runoff. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  About 100,000 people voted that Saturday, which is about the margin of my win. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=343.02s)]
*  This is how voter suppression happens. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=348.34s)]
*  This is how it works. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  You don't need a tsunami. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=351.46s)]
*  You just need to shave a few votes here, shave some there, make it difficult for people to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=353.14s)]
*  use drop boxes, ensure that African-Americans stand in lines many times longer than their [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=357.26000000000005s)]
*  counterparts, which all of the data shows is true, deal with issues around Sunday voting, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  weekend voting. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  And you get people turning democracy upside down rather than the people sending or choosing [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  their representatives. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=380.22s)]
*  The representatives start choosing the people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  And this is why Congress must pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which we introduced a couple [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=384.1s)]
*  of weeks ago, which provides a basic standard for voting to ensure that people have access [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=390.14s)]
*  to the franchise. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=396.58s)]
*  Nothing could be more important. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=397.46s)]
*  Yeah, the Freedom to Vote Act, which would create a kind of nationwide floor for voter [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=399.7s)]
*  access, in some ways kind of patch up what has been eviscerated in the wake of the Shelby [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=404.14s)]
*  County decision by the Supreme Court, which has shot a lot of holes in the Voting Rights [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=408.5s)]
*  Act, used to have the regime of preclearance. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=413.14000000000004s)]
*  Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=416.42s)]
*  And I should say that you can listen to a much longer conversation between the Senator [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=418.42s)]
*  and myself on the latest episode of my podcast, Why Is This Happening? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  We get through a lot of different issues, including his background, his experience in [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=425.98s)]
*  the Senate, and it is available now wherever you get your podcast or you can scan the QR [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=430.5s)]
*  code on your screen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeoufFJjreg&t=434.22s)]
