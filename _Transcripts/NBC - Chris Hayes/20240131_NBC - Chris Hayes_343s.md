# ‘Egotistical’: Ruhle says CEOs miss Trump White House ‘parades’ and praise
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8)
*  Joining me now is Stephanie Ruhl, senior business analyst at NBC News, host of the 11th Hour [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=0.0s)]
*  here on MSNBC, and someone who's been covering the economy a lot on your program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=4.24s)]
*  I came here because I thought I was getting Jerome Powell stripped down and twerking. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=8.32s)]
*  I see none of that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I played it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  And you just laid out the perv- you did all the economic news, there's nothing left for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  me to do, and you delivered me no twerking, so like, I got nothing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=18.88s)]
*  Well first of all, I'm right that him saying- I was sort of- I couldn't get over that clip. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=22.64s)]
*  Because central bankers are very evenly measured, markets move on adjectives they use, for him [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=27.08s)]
*  to be like, guys. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  That's huge, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=35.44s)]
*  People measure every twitch of his nose, just like Janet Yellen last week kind of ran a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=37.2s)]
*  victory lap. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=43.959999999999994s)]
*  I mean, when it comes to the administration and Janet Yellen doing that, both of these [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  things are huge. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Now, Jerome Powell is not working for the administration, but he is signaling to the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=50.16s)]
*  Yes, that rate cut is likely coming. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=56.32s)]
*  Not today, because he certainly doesn't want to be too early, but the administration is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=59.12s)]
*  also realizing- you laid it out, they've got all this great economic data, they need to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=63.04s)]
*  do a better job messaging this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=67.92s)]
*  And you said, listen, Trump does such a great job lying about it and convincing people, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=70.36s)]
*  Democrats need to do a better job talking about it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=75.4s)]
*  Look at oil production, Chris. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=77.36s)]
*  Why aren't we hearing from this White House, we're producing more oil than we ever have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=79.24s)]
*  in history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=85.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=86.56s)]
*  Because they don't want to piss off the far left. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=87.56s)]
*  Just like oftentimes in economic terms, Democrats should talk about a lot of economic wins, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=91.28s)]
*  they're often concerned about the people who are left out, and I get that, but they have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=96.32s)]
*  got to start running a victory lap, because if they're worried about those people left [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  out, they're going to be real left out if Trump wins. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just highlight the oil production. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=106.96s)]
*  I think, and I might be saying, I don't think that we're producing more oil than we ever [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  have. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=113.84s)]
*  I think that, in fact, if you look at the US, the US is producing more oil now than [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=115.8s)]
*  any nation on Earth. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=120.56s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=121.56s)]
*  And than any nation on Earth has ever produced. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=122.56s)]
*  Double correct. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=124.56s)]
*  Okay, I want to say that again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=125.56s)]
*  The US is currently producing more oil than any nation on Earth has ever produced. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=126.56s)]
*  Now, if you're someone who's worried about the climate, as I am, you hear that, you go, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=131.12s)]
*  ugh, that's not great. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=134.68s)]
*  Here's what I will say. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=135.68s)]
*  That's true, not great. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=136.68s)]
*  The theory of the case the Biden administration have is the only way you create the political [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=138.68s)]
*  spike up, the politics on the issue, go bananas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=143.44s)]
*  I think it's a perfectly credible theory of the case, but they have to communicate it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=146.64s)]
*  And also, if you're going to put the carbon in the air, which we're doing, you might as [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=150.8s)]
*  well reap the political benefit as opposed to being hush hush about it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=158.44s)]
*  In the same breath, after Davos, my head was spinning, that you kept hearing more and more [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=159.44s)]
*  CEOs kind of like open to this idea of Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=165.56s)]
*  And I'm mad dialing people like, is this for real? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=168.88s)]
*  And I learned two things. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=172.04s)]
*  A, it's, listen, they have to play ball because there's no CEO of a Fortune 500 company out [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=173.32s)]
*  there right now who wants to be the next Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, with a politician gunning [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=179.68s)]
*  for them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=184.72s)]
*  And they know there's the possibility it could be Trump and they don't want to be a target. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=185.72s)]
*  But B, they're also egotistical. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=189.44s)]
*  And they like to be called. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=192.68s)]
*  And President Biden, while he has lots of winning policies, does not parade CEOs around [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying that he should, but they like to get the call. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=201.0s)]
*  And one of them gave me this line that I thought was really interesting because I was like, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=204.0s)]
*  look at this data. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=207.12s)]
*  How can you say he's not pro-business? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=208.12s)]
*  And he said to me, you can tell a person's priorities based on their schedule. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=210.32s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't call us. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying that he should, but I'm telling you that's the cycle. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=216.52s)]
*  That is an amazing anecdote. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  I also heard an anecdote of the time that Joe Biden met Bill Ackman, the big hedge fund [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=221.28s)]
*  guy, and said about him, who is this a-hole, which I think is the funniest thing I've ever [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=225.24s)]
*  heard about. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=229.36s)]
*  I don't know a story that was supposed to stay in Vegas, but like all stories, didn't. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=230.4s)]
*  OK, so that's what you just said is actually really important because part of, so there's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  two elements to this sort of gap that we've had so far. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=238.36s)]
*  One of the weird things is, so there's a gap between people self-reporting how they feel [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  about the economy and the numbers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  But there's also this weird gap between people who were like CEOs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=247.36s)]
*  You pull them, they're like all pessimistic. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  There's going to be, they got it all wrong. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  By the way, they were wrong. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=254.52s)]
*  Like they just were wrong about what happened. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  But you would think that their bottom line matters more and they can't afford bias as [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=259.56s)]
*  much as someone further removed. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=265.12s)]
*  And it does seem to me like that class of folks, the people that watch business television, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=267.28s)]
*  business reporters, business people are like, OK, yeah, it's a good economy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Am I right about that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  They have finally been like, all right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a good economy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  It's a good economy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, they're not shouting from the rooftops, this is the best ever. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  Because remember also, you run a big business right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=283.64s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=286.56s)]
*  An empty office building. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=287.56s)]
*  OK, it's not like they do. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=288.6s)]
*  They get there's not an employees to stroke. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=291.6s)]
*  Where are these people? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=293.6s)]
*  They're going to be so nice to me all day. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=294.88s)]
*  This is an issue. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=297.72s)]
*  You know, they've got a good economy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=299.52s)]
*  They're not going to say it is a bad economy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=301.24s)]
*  It's a strong one. And you nailed it perfectly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=305.08s)]
*  This is exactly why Republicans are pivoting to immigration. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=307.48s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=311.16s)]
*  If Republicans keep punting on this immigration deal, Joe Biden is going to show up with the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=312.6s)]
*  receipts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=317.04s)]
*  Yes, totally. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=318.04s)]
*  And say, I had a deal, you wouldn't sign. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=319.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=320.04s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl, thank you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=321.04s)]
*  What a pleasure. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=322.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffuA3ENKM8&t=323.04s)]
