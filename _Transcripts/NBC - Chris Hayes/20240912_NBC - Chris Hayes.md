# Trump cozies up to racist far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The country just marked the 23rd anniversary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=0.0s)]
*  of the 9-11 attacks on America that killed 3,000 people. Donald Trump attended a remembrance [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=4.72s)]
*  ceremony in Lower Manhattan. And as his guest, the ex-president brought a conspiracy theorist [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=10.32s)]
*  who says 9-11 was an inside job. Her name is Laura Loomer, and she joined Trump and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  running mate JD Vance as they took photos with firefighters. You cannot make this up. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=23.84s)]
*  You really wouldn't want to. It's heinous, also, sadly, unsurprising. For almost a decade now, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=28.96s)]
*  Donald Trump has used his political platform to channel the worst, most vile, discredited, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  disgusting rhetoric, ideas, and people and mainstreaming them into American culture. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  From reposting Nazi trolls during his 2016 campaign to defending some of the torch-carrying, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  hailing neo-Nazis as very fine people in Charlottesville when he was president, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=53.76s)]
*  to whipping up violent far-right gangs and extremist militias like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=58.48s)]
*  Trump has dined with neo-Nazis, courted Holocaust deniers, and endorsed conspiracy theorists of all [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=63.28s)]
*  stripes. In fact, just today, get this, NPR reported that a Nazi sympathizer who served [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=68.72s)]
*  three years in prison for storming the Capitol on January 6th was an honored guest at two [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=75.28s)]
*  different events at Trump's Bedminster Golf Resort. And yes, that is the photograph of the alleged [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=81.44s)]
*  Nazi sympathizer, if you want to take that in. At one of those events, a fundraiser for the January [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=88.56s)]
*  6th criminals, Trump addressed the crowd by video, saying, all of the people there, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=94.88s)]
*  that includes the man you see there on your screen, all of the people there, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=100.88s)]
*  your amazing patriots, have a great time at Bedminster. Hope that guy had a good time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=104.72s)]
*  Trump has also forged a bond with far-right billionaire troll Elon Musk, saying that if [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=111.6s)]
*  he's elected, he'll put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission. And this week, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=116.0s)]
*  when pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Trump's opponent, Musk responded by posting the creepiest, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=120.48s)]
*  truly unsettling sexist taunt to her on social media platform he owns. Trump cleaves to the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=125.2s)]
*  absolute worst, most dangerous people. If he becomes president again, it's going to be even worse. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=131.36s)]
*  Laura Loomer is exhibit A. The two seem to be rather inseparable lately, spending a lot of time [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=136.8s)]
*  together. That's her coming off his private plane. In addition to being his 9-11 guest, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=143.68s)]
*  she accompanied Trump to Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. She's been seen with him in his [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Bedminster club, and her name has been on Trump's lips for much of this year. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Where is she? Where's Laura? She is amazing. A fantastic woman, a true patriot, Laura Loomer. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=166.56s)]
*  Laura, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Laura. It's great to have you. You've been really very [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  special. You work hard, and you are a very opinionated lady. I have to tell you that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  And in my opinion, I like that. I appreciate all of your support. And everybody appreciates you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me to sit with you today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  It's a pleasure. You're the best. I love you. It's a cute video, like they genuinely seem to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=196.08s)]
*  really like each other. Now, many Republicans are expressing concern to reporters about Loomer's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  closeness to Trump, which you can see for yourself. Everyone who works for him thinks she's a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  liability, one Trump ally said. Others have told reporters that Loomer has contributed to some of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=210.96s)]
*  the most outrageous conspiracy theories Trump is now using as campaign fodder. Now, even in the very [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  large pantheon of Trump's sycophants, Loomer is a chilling figure, a history of racist and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=222.0s)]
*  Islamophobic comments. She first gained notoriety for chaining herself to the door of a Twitter [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=228.08s)]
*  office in New York to protest the website banning her after she spread false conspiracy theories [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=233.76s)]
*  about multiple mass shootings. Before that ban, Loomer also tweeted hateful bile about immigrants, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=239.84s)]
*  responding to a news story about thousands of migrants dying while trying to cross the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=246.88s)]
*  Mediterranean to safety. She posted, quote, good clapping emoji. Here's to 2000 more. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=250.4s)]
*  After Elon Musk bought Twitter, Loomer was, surprise, surprise, reinstated on the platform. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=258.88s)]
*  That's where she called 911 an inside job last year, arguing that Donald Rumsfeld helped stage [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=264.08s)]
*  it to take over the national security bureaucracy. Twitter is also where this past summer Loomer [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=271.04s)]
*  called Kamala Harris a drug-using prostitute. Around that time, as Donald Trump was praising [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=276.72s)]
*  her rallies, what a patriot. Loomer also called for the death of Trump's perceived political enemies. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=282.16s)]
*  Death penalty in the next Trump administration. In advance of the debate last weekend, Loomer [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=306.72s)]
*  also tweeted that in my quarter here, if Kamala Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  The kind of thing that you hear from like maybe a second grader who's not particularly enlightened [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=326.16s)]
*  on the playground. A jab at Harris's Indian heritage that is so racist that it got called [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  out by a fellow Republican who said, quote, this is appalling and extremely racist. It does not [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=336.4s)]
*  represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA. This does not represent President Trump. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  That Republican was Marjorie Taylor Greene. Yes, the Jewish space lasers lady. Her rhetoric and her [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  tone is, does not match the base, does not match MAGA, does not match most Republicans I know. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=355.52s)]
*  And I am completely denouncing it. I'm curious what JD Vance and Usha Vance think about [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=362.48s)]
*  that as well. I haven't heard from them on it. I mean, Marjorie Taylor Greene has denounced it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=369.76s)]
*  Now, in truth, Loomer is just deploying all the same rhetorical tactics that Greene and others in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  the MAGA movement, including the guy at the top of the ticket Donald Trump and JD Vance have used [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=378.8s)]
*  and use every day. It's not any different. The bigotry, the deflections, the calls to protect [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=383.44s)]
*  free speech. You've heard it again this week as Republicans continue to spread an incredibly vile [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=388.72s)]
*  and honestly dangerous lie, falsely accusing Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=394.16s)]
*  of stealing and eating house pets. All week, city officials have said it's a lie. It didn't happen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  And guess what happened today? You'll never guess what happened today. Yes, the Springfield City [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  Hall and other facilities were shut down after receiving a bomb threat. Haitian families in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=409.52000000000004s)]
*  that community are now keeping their kids home from school and staying home out of fear of racist [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=415.92s)]
*  violence. One woman who said her car had its windows broken and acid thrown on it told a reporter, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=420.24s)]
*  I'm going to have to move because this area is no longer good for me. I can't even leave my house [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=425.2s)]
*  to go to Walmart. I'm anxious and scared. That's the real toll from the racist lie that has been [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  pushed by JD Vance and Donald Trump. And it's a lie. Trump is still repeating just in the past [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=436.88s)]
*  few hours. The migrants are walking off with the town's geese. They're taking the geese, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=442.88s)]
*  you know, where the geese are in the park in the lake and even walking off with their pets. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=451.36s)]
*  My dog's been taken. My dog's been stolen. This can only happen. These people are the worst. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=457.6s)]
*  It can only happen in your mind, right? Again, it's a disgusting lie. I think most people, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=466.0s)]
*  when they hear this old man ranting about it, know it is. It's based on a false rumor that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=472.16s)]
*  started on a Facebook page spread like wildfire late last month. After a speaker at the Springfield [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=476.24s)]
*  City Commission meeting warned that, quote, crime and savagery will only increase with every Haitian [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=482.88000000000005s)]
*  you bring in. And that man, that man turned out to be a leader of a neo-Nazi group calling itself [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=489.44000000000005s)]
*  Blood Pride. He was immediately kicked out of the meeting for his racist rant. But guess what? Now, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=496.24s)]
*  Blood Pride's talking points are the talking points of Donald Trump and the presidential campaign [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=503.6s)]
*  and the entire Republican Party. The Blood Pride guy ranting about the Haitians at the local [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=509.44s)]
*  committee meeting is now the voice of the entire Republican Party. Republicans understand that the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=515.84s)]
*  lies they're perpetuating about immigrants leads to violence against immigrants. And you know how [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=524.48s)]
*  I know? Because I heard it from a very close confidant to Trump named Laura Loomer. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=529.6s)]
*  Every damn day we see another story about illegal aliens going to the Ritz-Carlton, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=536.16s)]
*  illegal aliens getting free flights, illegal aliens getting free clothes and free cell phones, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=540.64s)]
*  and someone's going to snap. Someone's going to snap. It's going to happen. And you know what? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=545.76s)]
*  I'm not going to care when it happens. You know why? Because there's only so much people can take. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=550.24s)]
*  She wants someone to hurt them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=555.76s)]
*  It all reminds me of what President Joe Biden has repeatedly said about his decision to run against [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump in 2020. Biden said he wanted to run because of Trump's defense of the neo-Nazis in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  Charlottesville, the ones chanting Jews will not replace us, the very fine people in Trump's words. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=571.6s)]
*  Biden said correctly that he was in a battle for the soul of the nation. Biden may be out of the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=576.8s)]
*  running, but that battle does continue today. Donald Trump has always been an organizing and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=582.0s)]
*  rallying force for the absolute worst people and tendencies in the country. The people that march [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=587.84s)]
*  with torches, the people that show up at the local city council meeting to spew racist bile, the folks [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  that bash cops' brains in and carry a confederate flag into the Capitol, the people that throw [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=600.32s)]
*  around vile racial slanders against both immigrants and Kamala Harris. This is not just guilt by [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=605.44s)]
*  association. She's flying on his plane. He's using their rhetoric. He is choosing to empower [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=610.72s)]
*  people like Laura Loomer. Those are the sorts of people who will enjoy greater power in a second [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=618.0s)]
*  term, I promise you. And of all of the reasons to prevent him from winning another term, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=624.8800000000001s)]
*  that might be the most important. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOK1R0mXWD8&t=630.6400000000001s)]
