# 'Republicans are full of it' when it comes to 'rule of law,' says former SDNY chief
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0)
*  And Preet Bharara, the former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, joins me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=0.0s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=4.4s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=5.2s)]
*  A real interesting study in contrast over the last few weeks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=6.2s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=10.4s)]
*  What strikes you about the reaction today? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=11.4s)]
*  So when you think about the Biden family and how Joe Biden in particular thinks about his job, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=16.0s)]
*  but not just his job, about his family, upon the conviction or before the conviction, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=20.8s)]
*  upon the investigation and arrest and indictment of his son, given what his family has been through, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=26.8s)]
*  you would think that every parental, every fatherly instinct would have been to protect him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=31.8s)]
*  If you're a father, I know you are, you love your children more than you love yourself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  You try to protect them from harm. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=41.6s)]
*  You try to protect them from bad consequences. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  And the Biden family has suffered a lot of bad things as a family. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  And yet there's some things that are more important than that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=51.0s)]
*  When you were the commander in chief and you're the, you know, basically the president of the country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=53.4s)]
*  And one of those things is that no one is above the law and the rule of law matters. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=59.4s)]
*  And here is an occasion, as you've been pointing out in the intro, where Joe Biden had absolute authority, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=63.2s)]
*  literal authority. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=69.8s)]
*  He had no authority over Alvin Bragg. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=70.8s)]
*  He didn't direct the prosecution of Donald Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=72.4s)]
*  It's his Justice Department. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=74.8s)]
*  He had authority to direct people not to prosecute his son. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=76.4s)]
*  He could have fired the special counsel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=82.0s)]
*  He could have directed the special counsel not be appointed in the first place. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=83.4s)]
*  He could have pardoned his son preemptively. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=86.2s)]
*  He could still pardon him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=88.8s)]
*  He said he won't do that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=89.8s)]
*  All of that conduct, given that it's his son, is kind of, you should pause for a moment and think about how unbelievable that is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=91.4s)]
*  In a million years, if the shoe were on the other floor and Donald Trump was facing the prospect of his son being prosecuted by a Biden, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=99.2s)]
*  if I had been held over, a Biden holdover or Obama holdover prosecutor, not in a million, million years would that have happened. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, some of the people on the right, the people who support Donald Trump, are trying to cast this as some clever ops program by which [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=117.2s)]
*  this actually proves that it's amazing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=128.0s)]
*  It's a non-false, but I will say it's outlandish to imagine Don Jr. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=132.0s)]
*  getting into trouble with guns and drugs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=135.0s)]
*  But Stephen Miller said this, the gun charges are a giant misdirection and easy op for DOJ to sell to a client media that is all too willing to be duped. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=137.4s)]
*  Don't be gaslit. This is all about protecting Joe Biden, only Joe Biden. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=147.6s)]
*  So, like, no matter what happens, right, the corrupt rig system is just deeper than you realize. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  I replied to that. If every possible outcome, if every possible permutation is arguably a point in your favor, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=155.6s)]
*  then maybe your position is terrible. And I use a different word than terrible. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=162.8s)]
*  You know, I don't even honestly, I don't even think he was required even by probity to keep David Weiss on in Delaware. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=165.9s)]
*  No, honestly, like that is when I say bend over backwards, that is bending a wreck. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  It would have been perfectly reasonable. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=178.6s)]
*  And over backwards above and beyond to replace him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=180.4s)]
*  And obviously wouldn't be reasonable to say, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, drop a hundred case. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=183.4s)]
*  But if you say, hey, do your thing, but he didn't have to do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=187.6s)]
*  And by the way, some other features of this are also important to point out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=191.4s)]
*  And you mentioned some of them in the intro. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  This jury verdict came out. They didn't dox the jury. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=197.8s)]
*  They didn't attack the judge. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  He didn't say this is a travesty of justice. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  This is a witch hunt. He said what people say. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=205.5s)]
*  What I used to say when I was his attorney for seven and a half years and from time to time, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  even though we thought we brought a righteous and notorious case. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  You win some, you lose some. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And you say we respect the verdict of the jury, completely opposite to what Donald Trump did. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=214.4s)]
*  It was striking to me. You just mentioned this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=220.3s)]
*  One of the most striking things is after that Trump verdict. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=222.0s)]
*  And I remember Judge Kaplan in that federal civil trial with Eugene Carroll told the jurors, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  look, you can talk to the press if you want. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  I'd advise you not to. And they didn't. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=232.8s)]
*  And they didn't. In Alvin Bragg's case, they did not talk to the press. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  And I think we all know the reason. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=237.4s)]
*  They would expose themselves to harassment and possibly threats and possibly violence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=239.0s)]
*  Here today, you had the jurors talking to the press, which again, great, I'm a reporter. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=243.3s)]
*  I like it. But what a contrast. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=246.3s)]
*  No, it's a very stark contrast. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=249.2s)]
*  And I think it goes to just show that when Joe Biden and his supporters talk about rule of law [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  and nobody being above the law, they mean it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=258.5s)]
*  And you can disagree with Joe Biden's policies. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=261.4s)]
*  You can talk about the border and all these other things that are not in my bailiwick, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=263.4s)]
*  about politics. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=266.8s)]
*  But on the question of whether or not the rule of law is to be enforced and there's no fear or favor [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=268.2s)]
*  to be given to anyone, including the son of a sitting president of the United States, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=273.8s)]
*  the Republicans are full of it on the Trump side and Biden is not. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=278.4s)]
*  He's walked the walk. Final question for you is about independence and the Department of Justice. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, we have a post-Nixon order, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=287.2s)]
*  I mean, one of the things about Nixon, right, the reckoning with Nixon, both at a sort of level of regulation, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=291.2s)]
*  norms and statutes was the Department of Justice can't just be a tool in the hands of the executive [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  to pursue vendetta, to prosecute and punish enemies, to protect France. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=302.2s)]
*  Yeah. The Trump vision is exactly that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=308.3s)]
*  And in fact, explicitly that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=311.2s)]
*  I mean, if you read the Russ, the Russ vote profile, I mean, they really think we're going to come in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=312.7s)]
*  and it's going to be like day one, go open investigation. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=318.0s)]
*  That person prosecute that person. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=321.1s)]
*  Yeah, that which they have accused everyone else of doing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=322.6s)]
*  They are explicitly saying they're going to want to do. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=326.3s)]
*  There's a great irony. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=327.8s)]
*  You know, one with respect to one of the cases pending against Donald Trump, the Mar-a-Lago documents case [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=328.8s)]
*  in federal court in Florida, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=333.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's team has made a number of motions to dismiss the indictment. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=335.8s)]
*  One of those is vindictive prosecution, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  There's no evidence of that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=342.3s)]
*  There's no evidence that Joe Biden or anyone else directed that investigation and that prosecution and that indictment. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=343.1s)]
*  But by saying the things that they're saying now that you're pointing out, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=349.8s)]
*  Donald Trump actually, ironically, laying the foundation for a vindictive prosecution motion to dismiss [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=352.6s)]
*  on the part of all the current people that Donald Trump is going to be going after [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=359.5s)]
*  because he's announcing his plans before election. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=363.0s)]
*  All of those statements and those plans, Project 2025 and everything else are going to be chapter and verse in the briefs [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=366.3s)]
*  asking for the dismissal of those indictments. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=372.3s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=374.0s)]
*  Pre-Baroar. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=374.6s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=375.2s)]
*  Come back anytime. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=375.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezBBByOT_0&t=376.5s)]
