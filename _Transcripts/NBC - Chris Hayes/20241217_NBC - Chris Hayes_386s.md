# ‘Chilling’: Chris Hayes and Ari Melber talk MAGA’s war on the free press
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw)
*  Ari Melber is MSNBC's chief legal correspondent, the host of The Beat with Ari Melber, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=0.0s)]
*  he joins me now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=4.32s)]
*  Good to see you, man. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=5.32s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=6.32s)]
*  Bye. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=7.32s)]
*  I, okay, what's your, the Seltzer, the Seltzer lawsuit feels like one of those sort of like [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=8.32s)]
*  press release dressed up as a lawsuit at one level. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=14.8s)]
*  At another level, there really has been a worrying trend in the gates opening and judges [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=18.2s)]
*  letting more of these forward. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=22.78s)]
*  Well, how do you take it? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=23.96s)]
*  The suing of a pollster for a poll you didn't like in a field where polls, when done right, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=25.28s)]
*  have a variation is completely frivolous unless through discovery you find some new consumer [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=32.04s)]
*  fraud plot. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=38.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=39.96s)]
*  They have not yet shown that evidence. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=40.96s)]
*  There has been, it's not just Robinson, it's not just Trump, we've seen Elon Musk go after [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  media matters with the lawsuit. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=45.8s)]
*  And I want to be clear here, like we're a little biased because we're reporters and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=47.46s)]
*  I generally think the free press is important and I think the standard for defamation should [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  be high. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=54.0s)]
*  Also, there are legitimate instances of defamation and it's important for people not to be defamed [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=55.0s)]
*  and for us to get it right and do our best to get it right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=59.64s)]
*  In general, what do you make of this sort of lawsuit fuselage coming from Trump? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=63.28s)]
*  Well, one, you're right about the disclosures so we can be honest with the audience about [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=68.24s)]
*  that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=72.6s)]
*  We have an expertise about this as journalists, but we have a view that journalism is a good [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=73.6s)]
*  thing that should flourish and not be stomped out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=77.8s)]
*  And you can add to that, I practiced First Amendment law when I used to litigate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=80.88s)]
*  So you can say all of that, I have defended journalist rights in this arena. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=83.88s)]
*  Having said all that, there is a way to look at this, hopefully, for what's good for the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=87.96s)]
*  country and it has been a nonpartisan long tradition dating back to the fourth estate [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=92.96s)]
*  of the founders, verbiage, that this was key to the facts and sunlight of a democracy and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=98.8s)]
*  common facts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  It's very clear that there's a deliberate orchestrated strategy here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=106.44s)]
*  I thought your report showed many of the key aspects, which is excellent. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=109.96s)]
*  Rachel has tracked Peter Thiel, who funded anonymous lawsuits against journalists years [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=114.8s)]
*  ago and even ended up bankrupting Gawker, which whatever its sins and the courts did [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=120.8s)]
*  find mistakes, it was a corporate death penalty for a mistake in journalism. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=125.36s)]
*  And so there's a big question here about A, what they want to do, whether win or lose [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=130.28s)]
*  to chill, as you've reported. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=134.88s)]
*  And then B, we should keep an eye on this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=136.34s)]
*  There are a lot of right wing figures who want to bring the key First Amendment case [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=138.66s)]
*  here that protects journalists and has a high standard for reporting on public officials [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=143.64s)]
*  in the government. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=147.22s)]
*  They want to get it to the Supreme Court, which means they might like a Trump related [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=148.22s)]
*  loss that they can appeal all the way to Trump's Supreme Court. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  This is really key. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=154.48s)]
*  So first of all, the context here is that Trump's been doing this forever. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=155.66s)]
*  This is what he does. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=158.5s)]
*  In the 1980s, when he was a real estate developer, he sued the Chicago Tribune when its architecture [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=159.7s)]
*  writer described his proposed Manhattan skyscraper as ugly monstrosity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=164.72s)]
*  The suit was dismissed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=168.92s)]
*  He lost defamation against media groups, including CNN and the New York Times. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=170.34s)]
*  Now, you know, a critic saying something's an ugly monstrosity is like core First Amendment [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=173.96s)]
*  speech. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=178.04s)]
*  Like it must be the case. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=179.04s)]
*  It's what protects Donald Trump's rights to insult so many people in public. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=180.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Which again, core protected. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  But your point about, so you've got a bunch of people, Teal, Musk, Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=185.32s)]
*  This is the way they want to go after the press. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=190.14s)]
*  The worrying thing is what judges are doing with it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=193.12s)]
*  And the key case, if you get explained to people, which is Sullivan, which sets the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=195.74s)]
*  standard legendary case, we already have Clarence Thomas, I think, on the record in some dissents [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=200.08s)]
*  being like, Sullivan's wrong. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=204.4s)]
*  We should overrule it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=205.72s)]
*  Conservative judges may be looking at that, looking to get sort of teed up a case to open [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=207.24s)]
*  the floodgates to this kind of thing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=211.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is the key case that gives reporters in America and others talking about public [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=213.0s)]
*  figures such robust rights. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=217.8s)]
*  Other countries don't necessarily have this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  You might have narrow or free speech. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=221.2s)]
*  And it's from a civil rights era ruling that basically found that it's a higher standard [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  to actually be sued out of existence or end up paying big amounts when you are reporting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=228.04s)]
*  on discussing public figures, that you have to basically prove that a statement was not [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  only false, but it was knowingly false, a lie, or made so recklessly that you didn't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=237.32s)]
*  even check it out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=243.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=244.54s)]
*  And this is where your expertise comes in. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=245.54s)]
*  You, the team at All In, MSNBC reporters, the ABC reporters, if you want to take folks [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=246.54s)]
*  who are not us, do a great deal of work all day to fact check things to the best of their [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=251.0s)]
*  ability before it makes air. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=257.04s)]
*  And if they make a mistake, then they try to correct it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=258.96s)]
*  And a little footnote, if I may, on the ABC case that may interest people, I thought you [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=261.76s)]
*  did a very precise job of referring to the underlying facts. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=265.16s)]
*  Even after settling, and we could debate whether ABC should have settled what many lawyers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=269.36s)]
*  thought was a winnable case, but people settled for different reasons. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=272.96s)]
*  You'll notice the statement they agreed upon, along with paying this money back, did not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=276.68s)]
*  refer, in ABC's agreed statement, to a falsehood. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=281.12s)]
*  It said, we regret the statements. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=285.44s)]
*  And that's the deal they struck. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  And so that's another big difference is most reputable outlets, if we find out something's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=289.84s)]
*  false, we correct it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  They didn't do that then. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=295.08s)]
*  And again, other people can debate it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  We're all here to discuss. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=298.96s)]
*  But their statement said, we regret the statements. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=300.64s)]
*  And if I'm not mistaken, and man, I hope I'm not as I'm about to say this on live TV since [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  we just had this conversation, the plaintiffs in Sullivan were folks that did not like the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=308.2s)]
*  New York Times coverage of the civil rights in what was going on from the civil rights [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=312.08s)]
*  movement in the South. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=317.12s)]
*  Yeah, and there was a set publishing of, and you get into real deep first-person issues [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=318.12s)]
*  like are you publishing information or reporting when you're publishing names of people involved [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=321.2s)]
*  in the struggle or in the donations? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=327.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=329.36s)]
*  So you've got this protection there, the court, we don't know what's happened. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=330.36s)]
*  You've got these civil lawsuits, which I think we're going to see. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=334.68s)]
*  And then there's the thing he says, which is, I wish the Justice Department should have [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  done it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=341.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=342.48s)]
*  But now it's left to me. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=343.48s)]
*  So that's the other big question that we're heading towards. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=344.48s)]
*  They ought to do something really melts into we. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=346.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=349.64s)]
*  And that would be pretty unprecedented. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=350.64s)]
*  I mean, I don't think we've seen a Justice Department go after the free press, either [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=352.12s)]
*  civilly or criminally. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=356.48s)]
*  Certainly not in my lifetime, not for a long time. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=358.44s)]
*  Ari Melber, of course, host of The Beat, weekdays at 6 p.m. right here on MSNBC. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=360.0s)]
*  It's great to have you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=363.88s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=364.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=365.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gurme8waaw&t=367.24s)]
