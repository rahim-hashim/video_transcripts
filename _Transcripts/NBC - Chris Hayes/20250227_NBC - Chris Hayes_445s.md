# Our own Brexit? Experts warn of 'economic mayhem' thanks to Trump policies
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes having campaign on a promise to fix everything five weeks into the Trump administration and things are looking like they're breaking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=0.0s)]
*  From eggs to housing prices, prices continue to rise. Jobless claims are up and rather ironically today, Donald Trump hosted the Prime Minister of the UK, Keir Starmer, at the White House for the first time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=10.0s)]
*  A guy who came into power after a decade and a half of conservative rule and knows a thing or two about inheriting a bad economy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=23.0s)]
*  Keir Starmer is now the man trying to claw his country out of a deep economic hole, a hole dug in 2016 when the country narrowly voted in favor of Brexit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=30.0s)]
*  The historic decision by British voters for their country to exit the European Union sent economic shockwaves from the UK to the US and a tidal wave of economic worries swamping the markets. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=41.0s)]
*  The Dow lost over 3% of its value, wiping out all its gains for the year. The EU, established to bring unity and greater economic clout to Europe, is in crisis as Europe, the US and the rest of the world absorb the profound ramifications. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=53.0s)]
*  Now that right wing plan to abandon the EU and the euro was sold as a way for Brits to take control over their own economy, even as experts warned it would drive up prices as well as tanking the British pound along with trade salaries and employment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=68.0s)]
*  The experts were right. Brexit was a disaster for the UK, setting back one of the world's strongest economies by years. Even many advocates of Brexit admitted it failed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=82.0s)]
*  It has been so bad that a poll last month showed that 55% of British people said their country was wrong to leave the EU. Only 30% had no regrets. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=93.0s)]
*  It was a completely self-inflicted shock to the entire country and its populace. They are still recovering from almost a decade later. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=104.0s)]
*  Back in 2016, of course, Donald Trump frequently campaigned on being the guy to bring Brexit to the US. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=113.0s)]
*  Well, they call me Mr. Brexit over there. So we'll see what happens. The UK wanted independence and they got it. And you know what? I think they're going to be better off for it. And it's turning out now. It's a very short period of time, but it's turning out to be better so far. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=121.0s)]
*  No, no, the opposite. In fact, now Mr. Brexit is at it again. There's a growing fear that Trump's election is basically our own version of that catastrophe for the UK in 2016. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=134.0s)]
*  Trump is pursuing a similarly radical economic agenda, one that economists and other experts warn will leave the US to ruin. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=148.0s)]
*  Today we got a lot of signs the American economy is somewhat suddenly trending in the wrong direction and that Trump could soon make it much, much worse. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=155.0s)]
*  Trump announcing his long promised tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect next Tuesday. We'll see if that happens. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=164.0s)]
*  Now, if that happens, and again, been sort of futzing around with this, but all of it will jack up the prices Americans pay for goods imported for those countries. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=170.0s)]
*  Mexico, our biggest trading partner, those tariffs, essentially new double digit sales taxes that you will pay will drive inflation higher. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=180.0s)]
*  There will be tariffs in exchange to those other countries for our imports, force a lot of people to cut back their spending. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=190.0s)]
*  That's worrying the country's top economists. Today, the chairman of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, Jeffrey Schmidt, warned the Fed might have to keep interest rates high to fight price inflation, even as economic growth slows and possibly stops. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=197.0s)]
*  A dreaded scenario known as stagflation, something US hasn't had to worry about since the 1970s. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=211.0s)]
*  Now, last year, economists were talking about how many times the Fed might cut interest rates. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=216.0s)]
*  Now they may go higher. That, along with inflated prices, is killing an already tight housing market. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=221.0s)]
*  Listen to this. This really blew my mind. Today, the National Association of Realtors announced that pending home sales dropped 5% last month to their lowest level since the group started collecting those statistics in 2001. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=226.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=241.0s)]
*  Pending home sales today are lower than they were at any point in the Great Recession. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=243.0s)]
*  No wonder the consumer confidence fell this month. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=248.0s)]
*  In fact, it was the largest single month drop in consumer confidence since 2021, back when the post-COVID supply constraints spiked up prices. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=251.0s)]
*  And it's not just consumers. Business leaders are already starting to sour on Trump as the economic uncertainty starts to pile up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=260.0s)]
*  You know what else is piling up? Oh, look at that. Jobless claims. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=269.0s)]
*  Nearly a quarter of a million files for unemployment last week. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=272.0s)]
*  That's the highest total since last October, as Trump and Elon Musk's firings of government workers start to be felt throughout the economy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=275.0s)]
*  We could feel a whole lot more very soon. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=282.0s)]
*  Again, all this does so far is just like around the edges. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=284.0s)]
*  The US economy is pretty robust. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=287.0s)]
*  But get this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=289.0s)]
*  Yesterday, OMB director and Project 2025 architect Russell Vogt sent a memo out to all federal agencies telling them to prepare to initiate large scale reductions in the workforce, including identifying all employees in their purview who are performing functions that aren't mandated by law and aren't deemed essential during a lapse in appropriations. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=290.0s)]
*  So that means that every employee who gets sent home during a lapse in appropriations is going to be sent home to the federal government. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=304.0s)]
*  So that means that every employee who gets sent home during a government funding shutdown, right, when the government is shrunk to sort of its minimum essentials is potentially on the chopping block. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=315.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, that's 800,000 people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=326.0s)]
*  800,000 layoffs we're talking about possibly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=331.0s)]
*  In addition to the hundreds of thousands of firings, Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency have already tried to pull off, some of which have been stayed by court, some of which haven't. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=336.0s)]
*  We get new ones every day. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=344.0s)]
*  Today we got the National Weather Service. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=345.0s)]
*  Fireings on this scale is just on its face a recipe for an enormous recession. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=349.0s)]
*  It's all gotten so bad that even an economist at the conservative pro-Trump American Enterprise Institute is warning of an economic slowdown. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=355.0s)]
*  There's more uncertainty than I think is widely appreciated, he told the New York Times today. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=364.0s)]
*  All the uncertainty around trade policy, uncertainty around some of the things the Department of Government Efficiency is doing, I think will have a chilling effect on investment plans and expansion plans. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=369.0s)]
*  This is precisely the moment that Great Britain faced with Brexit. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=380.0s)]
*  It was a moment where a Democratic electorate got together and voted to do something that just made everyone's life worse in unfortunately totally foreseeable ways. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=385.0s)]
*  The result was a lost decade for the UK. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=397.0s)]
*  Like basically everyone's lives got worse. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=400.0s)]
*  The economy got worse. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=403.0s)]
*  They lost wage growth. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=404.0s)]
*  They lost prosperity. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=405.0s)]
*  They lost stability and security. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=406.0s)]
*  And there was no reason to do it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=408.0s)]
*  They just all got together and decided to do it to themselves. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=409.0s)]
*  There's a growing fear now that Donald Trump is poised to take an American economy that was the envy of the world, strong and stable just a month ago, and drive it into the ground. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=412.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pztx1EDeJZU&t=439.0s)]
