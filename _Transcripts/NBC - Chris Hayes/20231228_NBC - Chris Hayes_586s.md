# 'Duty bound': Maine's secretary of state speaks out after disqualifying Trump from ballot
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk)
*  We want to go back to the big news that we brought you at the top of this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has been kicked off another presidential ballot, this time in the state of Maine, a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=4.8s)]
*  decision that comes 10 days after the Supreme Court of Colorado ruled that Trump is disqualified [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=9.72s)]
*  from the ballot there due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election that culminated [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  in the insurrection of the Capitol on January 6th, though that Colorado decision is on pause [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=20.7s)]
*  pending an appeal by the state Republican Party. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=25.64s)]
*  There are 16 states that have been considering efforts to remove Trump from their ballots, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=28.32s)]
*  including Michigan, whose Supreme Court decided yesterday that Trump can stay on the ballot [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=32.24s)]
*  and Colorado and Maine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=37.5s)]
*  Most of those are lawsuits working their way through the courts, but Maine's process was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=40.34s)]
*  a little different. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  There, the arguments were made directly to the Democratic Secretary of State, Shenna [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Bellows. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=49.44s)]
*  It was her decision to make. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=50.44s)]
*  We have her here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=51.96s)]
*  Shenna Bellows, the Maine Secretary of State who signed off on that decision joins me now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=52.96s)]
*  Secretary Bellows, thank you so much for joining us on All In this evening. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=58.52s)]
*  I'm just going to ask you up front, what went into making this decision? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  Was it your own research? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=65.72s)]
*  Did you have a legal team together? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=67.4s)]
*  Did you look at the Colorado decision? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=69.72s)]
*  What was the process to come to the conclusion that Donald Trump should be disqualified from [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=71.88s)]
*  being on the Maine ballot? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=76.04s)]
*  Well, first, it's important, and thank you for having me, it's important to understand [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  how Maine's process differs from other states. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Under the United States Constitution, time, place, and manner, every state's laws around [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  elections and the conduct of elections are slightly different. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=91.54s)]
*  That's why, for example, in neighboring New Hampshire, you see more than a dozen candidates [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=94.98s)]
*  in both the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries, whereas in Maine, we have a very [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=98.78s)]
*  different process. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=104.26s)]
*  We had two Democratic candidates qualify for the presidential primary and less than a dozen [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=106.34s)]
*  candidates qualify for the Republican primary. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=111.44s)]
*  Now, under the law, I first make a determination about ballot qualification. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=114.58s)]
*  We accepted Trump's consent form and petitions to be placed on the primary ballot. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=120.05999999999999s)]
*  However, any registered Maine voter may challenge the qualifications of any candidate within [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=126.66s)]
*  a five-day period, and then I am required by law, it's an authority delegated to me [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=134.06s)]
*  explicitly by the Maine legislature to hold what's called a Section 336 challenge hearing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  Both parties come, they present their evidence, they file briefs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  I review only that evidence in the context of the laws, the facts presented, and the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=151.38s)]
*  Constitution, and then I must make a determination. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=159.06s)]
*  I'm duty-bound to both hold a hearing and make a ruling. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=161.42s)]
*  And under the law, there's a very compressed timeline. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=167.1s)]
*  In evaluating this, I came to the conclusion that I could not, unfortunately or fortunately, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=170.34s)]
*  wait for the United States Supreme Court to make a decision. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=178.3s)]
*  The Maine law required me to issue that decision, which I did today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=183.22s)]
*  Now, I have to say, not only is this an incredibly important decision, but it's a very brave [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=188.38s)]
*  decision. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=196.06s)]
*  The Trump campaign has already come out attacking you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=197.06s)]
*  They have said that you are a virulent leftist and a hyper-partisan Biden-supporting Democrat. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  It goes without saying that we all saw what happened on January 6th. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=208.66s)]
*  We've seen a tremendous amount of violence associated with any time someone tries to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  hold Trump accountable. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=217.7s)]
*  We've seen death threats against the judges in Colorado. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=218.7s)]
*  Was that a concern of yours, and has the state provided you with additional protection and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=223.18s)]
*  support since you've come down with this decision? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=228.08s)]
*  First and foremost, it's important to know my oath to the Constitution, my obligations [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  to the Constitution and rule of law come before any other consideration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=237.58s)]
*  No other factors could weigh on that decision and did not. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=242.28s)]
*  I'm very fortunate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  We are very fortunate here in Maine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=247.66000000000003s)]
*  We have terrific support from law enforcement, both within my department, the Maine Capitol [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=249.24s)]
*  Police, the Maine State Police. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  I feel well protected, as I have been for my entire time as Secretary. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=255.96s)]
*  So I have to ask this because I think this also speaks to your credibility. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=262.96s)]
*  Maine has some of the highest turnout of any state in the union. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=266.2s)]
*  I mean, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, you have, you know, Maine, even though as [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=270.24s)]
*  a state tends to vote for Democrats for president, you have one Independent Senator and one [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=274.4s)]
*  Republican. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  How do you get such high turnout in the state amongst all sort of political partisans? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  I smile because we were number one in voter turnout per capita in 2022. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=286.88s)]
*  We are really proud of that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=291.78s)]
*  And we have a really strong framework of election laws that encourage citizen participation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=293.88s)]
*  We have same day voter registration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=300.67999999999995s)]
*  We have no excuse absentee voting up to 30 days prior to Election Day. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=303.08s)]
*  We make it really easy to register to vote, to cast your ballot and know your ballot will [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=308.68s)]
*  be counted. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=314.97999999999996s)]
*  And we're really proud of our national leadership in voter participation and citizen engagement [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  in elections and in the democratic process. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=321.88s)]
*  And that's why we take so seriously our obligations to the Constitution and the rule of law. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=325.18s)]
*  Secretary Bellows, there are people all over the country, Independent groups, other secretaries [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=333.08s)]
*  of state, you know, judges, legislators, lawyers who are watching you right now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=337.38s)]
*  Are you expecting to or have you prior to this decision? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=344.08s)]
*  Has anyone reached out to you? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=348.32s)]
*  Have other secretaries of state reached out to you and said, hey, how did you, you know, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=349.56s)]
*  I'm struggling with this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=353.08s)]
*  Could you help me as well? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=354.18s)]
*  Or is this a decision that you're saying, hey, everything that I think is in this written [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=355.84s)]
*  decision and I'm not really open to providing, you know, counsel or assistance to any other [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=360.38s)]
*  states that may be struggling with this issue? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=365.58s)]
*  That's really important. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=368.97999999999996s)]
*  The latter is the case. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=369.97999999999996s)]
*  This decision is based on Maine law and the facts that were presented to me in the Section [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=371.88s)]
*  336 challenge. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=376.38s)]
*  It was really important to me to look at the evidence presented in the public hearing and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  the law and the facts presented in the context of Maine law, Sections 336, 337 and 443. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=384.48s)]
*  It's a very detailed decision. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=391.88s)]
*  We lay out why under Maine law, the Secretary of State has the authority, indeed the obligation [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=393.68s)]
*  on duty bound to make this determination. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=399.78s)]
*  We also, I rather laid out that the record demonstrates that in fact the events of January [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=403.58s)]
*  which were unprecedented and tragic were an insurrection in the meaning of Section 3 of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=410.78s)]
*  the 14th Amendment. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=416.08s)]
*  And finally, in reviewing the facts presented, the evidence, the law, the history, we determined [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=417.38s)]
*  under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment that Mr. Trump engaged in insurrection and therefore [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=428.38s)]
*  was disqualified. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  So one of the things that you mentioned is that since anyone within a certain period [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=436.78s)]
*  of time can challenge a candidate's eligibility, you had people present the case that Trump [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=440.78s)]
*  should be off the ballot. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=445.28s)]
*  And obviously you had people present the case that Trump should remain on the ballot, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=446.28s)]
*  You had people from both sides making this argument. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=450.28s)]
*  So here's my question. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=453.17999999999995s)]
*  I wonder if this sort of came up because it's always something I've questioned about sort [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  of the Trump argument. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=459.28s)]
*  Donald Trump claims that he was elected in 2020 and that the election was stolen from [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, my understanding of the Constitution is if you've already been elected twice, you're [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  not allowed to serve again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=472.48s)]
*  You know, how did you deal with some of the arguments that you heard from the Trump side [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=473.98s)]
*  and do they have an opportunity to appeal if they're unhappy with your decision? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=479.68s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Trump was represented by counsel. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  This was an administrative hearing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=488.38s)]
*  I was serving not as an advocate, but an adjudicator as an administrative hearing officer in the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=489.88s)]
*  hearing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dUCPD88Lk&t=494.78s)]
