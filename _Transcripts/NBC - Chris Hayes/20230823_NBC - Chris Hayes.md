# Indicted Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro demands speedy trial in Georgia
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI)
*  Tami Dayo, Agonga Williams, the former federal prosecutor who served as a senior investigative [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=0.0s)]
*  counsel on the January 6th Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=4.5s)]
*  Katherine Christian, former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=6.22s)]
*  and they join me now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=9.84s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=11.28s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  As someone who worked in that Manhattan DA's office, can we talk about the mugshot? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=16.8s)]
*  I'm of two minds about the mugshot. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=17.8s)]
*  I think, you know, I remember having conversations with people where I realized that mugshot [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=19.84s)]
*  was a very American thing, like you don't have mugshots in other countries. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=23.16s)]
*  And it always seems, you know, in the way that it's used in the New York Post and in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  the tabloids and Ron, it's, you know, it sort of presumes guilt in its form, right? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=31.36s)]
*  Like the mugshot looms. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=37.2s)]
*  It looms on the cover of tabloids. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=38.84s)]
*  It looms. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=40.2s)]
*  There's always something to me that's sort of gross about the use of that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=41.2s)]
*  At the same time, it's been notable that Donald Trump has not had to face the music on that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  score. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=48.32s)]
*  And it's a small thing, but watching this does feel like there's, in terms of how Fonny [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=49.32s)]
*  Wells is handling this, like there's a real kind of like equal justice under law kind [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=54.2s)]
*  of vibe here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=58.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=59.82s)]
*  So the other three indictments, Mr. Trump, a mugshot wasn't taken. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=60.82s)]
*  The rationale was the reason to take the mugshot is in case the defendant flees and you can [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=65.28s)]
*  find him and everyone knows what Donald Trump looks like. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=69.42s)]
*  But on the other hand, but on the other hand, as you said, everyone has their mugshot taken [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=72.34s)]
*  and why shouldn't he and why shouldn't Mr. Giuliani and all of the other defendants in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=78.9s)]
*  Georgia, the sheriff made it clear at the beginning, unless someone tells me different, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=83.44s)]
*  everyone's going to get their mugshot taken. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=88.12s)]
*  What do you think about it, Tamidaya? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=89.86s)]
*  I think one of the principles about all these cases is that no one is above the law and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  that everyone, including a former president, should be treated the same in front of a court. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=96.48s)]
*  And I think the mugshot is symbolic. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=100.8s)]
*  Yes, we all know how Donald Trump looks, but he should be subjected to the same scrutiny [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=102.96s)]
*  and regulations and everything else of every other everyday citizens. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=108.52s)]
*  And I think that's what it represents here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=111.94000000000001s)]
*  Same with the box, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=114.62s)]
*  I mean, that's the other thing that's interesting, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=115.62s)]
*  Like they've negotiated $200,000. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=117.06s)]
*  All these folks are bonding out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=118.5s)]
*  I mean, there's, you know, and this cash bail has been a subject of tremendous policy controversy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=120.06s)]
*  I think it's largely, again, not a great practice. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=125.42s)]
*  I think there's it's been overused. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  But in the, you know, watching Giuliani go to a pundit, you know, you're a New Yorker. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=129.82s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=136.5s)]
*  Like there is something about that that I don't know, it really hits. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=138.18s)]
*  And even the fact, and it's horrible, these conditions in that jail. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=141.88s)]
*  They're terrible. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=145.4s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=146.4s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=147.4s)]
*  There are thousands of people who are there now and who are going through it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  And you know, now, hello America, this is what it looks like. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=153.4s)]
*  And because these are white collar defendants who usually don't have to see that, now they're [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=157.76s)]
*  seeing a little touch of that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=162.14s)]
*  Let's talk about this Cheesebro filing here, which is sort of interesting. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, so far, I think our our general assumption has been everyone's going to want to kick [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=168.76s)]
*  the can. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=173.48s)]
*  They want to take it long. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=174.48s)]
*  They want to let Donald Trump get elected president. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=175.6s)]
*  Maybe he could work some magic, even though it's a Georgia state law. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=178.28s)]
*  It's being prosecuted under. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Cheesebro says, I want to be tried in December. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=183.92s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  I think it's a it's a choice here that he's testing the D.A. right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=187.0s)]
*  She's expecting Donald Trump wants to push this out as far as possible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=191.64s)]
*  And he's saying, are you ready right now? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=195.2s)]
*  Can you go as fast as possible? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  And I think what he's also trying to do is separate himself from President Trump. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  The entire strength of the case is that there is a massive criminal conspiracy from President [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump at the top and all his minions at the bottom. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  Now he's saying, I want to go first. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=211.64s)]
*  Try me, perhaps even by myself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  Show the evidence of the story that has to do with just me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  Don't bring in evidence about Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  Don't don't try the President Trump case. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=222.0s)]
*  Try my case. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=224.76s)]
*  And I think if that works, it has a possibility of weakening the jury appeal because you don't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=226.0s)]
*  get to tell the whole story from top to bottom. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=231.56s)]
*  You're telling his story, which is going to be a little bit more limited. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=234.56s)]
*  Well, and this this gets to the idea of the 19 codefendants and all being tried together, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=237.04s)]
*  which funny will is at that press conference on the day that these charges were announced [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=240.92s)]
*  that she's going to do a lot of legal lectures. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  It said there's no way it's going to happen. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=246.32s)]
*  Where do you sit on that? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=248.2s)]
*  Well, also, I think he's going to sort of lose that calling the bluff because, first [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  of all, what he's giving up his defense attorney, he's not going to have motions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=255.76s)]
*  Is he really saying I'm not going to move to suppress evidence? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=259.64s)]
*  Is he really saying I'm not going to spend months looking at the discovery to find inconsistent [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=262.56s)]
*  statements or possibly exculpatory material? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=267.44s)]
*  You think it's a bluff. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=270.92s)]
*  I think it's a bluff. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=271.92s)]
*  And if she calls the bluff, well, then guess what? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=272.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=276.04s)]
*  And now you're on trial and you're like you're stuck with all the evidence that you didn't [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=277.04s)]
*  move to suppress. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=281.16s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=283.04s)]
*  It's not these prosecutors who spent two and a half years investigating it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=284.36s)]
*  Their opening and their summations have already been written. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=288.8s)]
*  If not on paper, it's in their head. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=291.36s)]
*  And if he decides to suddenly say, oh, never mind, I'm not ready, well, that's the end [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=294.04s)]
*  of that, then no judge will ever listen to him again when he says he wants a speedy trial. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=297.92s)]
*  What do you think about the plan? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=302.48s)]
*  I mean, when you read through the 100-page indictment, one of the things that the document [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=304.6s)]
*  I think does well is it sort of conceives of it as a unified whole, even though there [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=310.72s)]
*  are many different aspects to the conspiracy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  And in some cases, I think a lot of people weren't even in contact with each other. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the strength, as Timmy Dio said, of the conceit of this as a RICO case and of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  the conceit of 19 defendants. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=327.6s)]
*  You tell the whole story at once. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=329.16s)]
*  What do you think about the possibility of that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, you mean trying it alone or trying it all? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  Are they going to be able to try 19 defendants? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, what's going to happen? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  What's going to happen, and I'm sure he's experienced this, I did, when you did conspiracy, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=337.8s)]
*  people drop off because they plead guilty, they cooperate. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=343.0s)]
*  So you end up not with 19 defendants. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=346.56s)]
*  Sometimes you'll end up with a firing squad where they're all shooting at each other, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=348.88s)]
*  a circular firing squad, because it's like, I only did this little piece. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=352.44s)]
*  Why am I stuck with Trump? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=355.96s)]
*  I'm only the middle person. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=358.36s)]
*  So there will not be 19 defendants on trial. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=360.3s)]
*  That's a really important point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  It actually brings up the next thing I want to talk about, which is about cooperation. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=365.16s)]
*  Because to your point of, we're not going to get to 19 because some people ... And when [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=369.8s)]
*  you look at the mugshot lineup that we have, these are people who are vastly vary in wealth, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=373.56s)]
*  stature, public support, public notoriety, the degree to which they can hire the best [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  lawyers, and whose exposure varies quite a bit. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=391.24s)]
*  And you've got to imagine they're going to start making some individual calculations. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIboOVKxSI&t=394.2s)]
