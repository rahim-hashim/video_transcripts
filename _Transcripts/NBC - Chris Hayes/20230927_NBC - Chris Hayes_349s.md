Video Description: Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump's motion asking that she recuse herself from the federal election interference case. “The problem is they’re going to lose their credibility. She’s going to feel you’re willing to make any old argument, and that really hurts the attorney in court,” says former federal prosecutor on the effect of Trump’s recusal bid.

# ‘Denied’: Trump loses bid to remove judge in federal coup trial
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ)
*  We have breaking news tonight in Donald Trump's criminal case in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the coup trial where Trump is charged with four felonies connected to his efforts [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=4.8s)]
*  to steal the 2020 election stay in power. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=9.64s)]
*  The judge in that case, Judge Tanya Chutkin, just filed an order responding to Trump's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=12.68s)]
*  motion asking she recuse herself from the case. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=18.68s)]
*  Trump actually began demanding Chutkin's refusal within days of his indictment on August 1st, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  just announcing that he had very powerful grounds for his request. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=27.4s)]
*  Earlier this month when he filed his motion, the grounds didn't look quite so powerful. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=31.08s)]
*  His lawyers based the motion on things Judge Chutkin said at hearings for two defendants [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=36.04s)]
*  facing sentencing for crimes at the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=40.72s)]
*  His lawyers arguing that Judge Chutkin had, quote, suggested President Trump should be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  prosecuted and imprisoned. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=49.0s)]
*  Well, in her 20-page response today, Judge Chutkin basically said they were making things [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  up, writing, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=56.16s)]
*  At the outset, it bears noting the court has never taken the position the defense ascribes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=57.16s)]
*  to it, that former President Trump should be prosecuted and imprisoned, and the defense [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=61.8s)]
*  does not cite any instance of the court ever uttering those words or anything similar. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  She goes on, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  It is the defense, not the court, who has assumed the defendant belongs in that undefined [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  group of people who should face charges. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=77.56s)]
*  And to extrapolate an announcement of the defendant's guilt from the court's silence [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=79.92s)]
*  is to adopt a hypersensitive, cynical, and suspicious perspective rather than a reasonable [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=83.62s)]
*  one. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=88.94s)]
*  Defendant's motion for recusal is denied. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=90.06s)]
*  Shan was a former federal prosecutor who served as counsel to Attorney General Janet Rideau, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=93.34s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  Shan, maybe we can start before we get into this of just what the standard for recusal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  I imagine it's got to be relatively high, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  The system works in these sort of random assignments of judges, and generally you kind [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=109.42s)]
*  of get the judge you get. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=114.14s)]
*  So what is the bar here? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=115.22s)]
*  It's a pretty high bar, Chris. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=117.72s)]
*  It's the clear and convincing standard, which is actually the next highest to the highest [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=119.34s)]
*  one, which is beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=124.54s)]
*  So it's a very challenging standard, and as you say, it's challenging for good reason, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=127.78s)]
*  because if you made it very easy, then you would really encourage judge shopping, and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=132.02s)]
*  That's what the court system does not want to do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  Now the reasoning here was the argument by Trump's lawyers is they basically zeroed it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=139.86s)]
*  on things she said at sentencing in two other January 6 trials. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=144.58s)]
*  My understanding is there's actually pretty bedrock Supreme Court precedent on this, and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=148.9s)]
*  there's a bunch of other cases that they cite in their brief that are judges saying things [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=153.74s)]
*  in public appearances in the press, and Judge Shetkin seems to be focused on saying, look, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=159.38s)]
*  those are not germane, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=163.62s)]
*  We're talking about what I said at sentencing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=165.86s)]
*  That's exactly right, and the precedent really talks about how judges who are speaking within [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=168.86s)]
*  the courtroom, that speech is particularly scrutinized with a high bar, as opposed to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=175.02s)]
*  making public pronouncements which might be deemed to be prejudicial. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=181.22000000000003s)]
*  And also the precedent zeroes in on whether the court is speaking about this particular [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  recusal, and she did not address it to Trump's guilt or whether he should be charged. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=192.18s)]
*  She was addressing arguments made by those defendants trying to lessen their guilt, saying [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=198.58s)]
*  they were influenced by others. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=204.18s)]
*  So the idea that as the court sets out in their order, that simply suggesting that the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=206.3s)]
*  court may have been suggesting that, that really is very, very far from meeting this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=210.88s)]
*  kind of standard. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we should just, I mean, just to give the context here, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  She's at sentencing for a defendant named Christine Priolo who's found guilty for her [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=218.38s)]
*  role in January 6. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=223.14s)]
*  She went inside the Capitol. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  Her lawyer's asked for leniency, arguing that Trump and his inner circle had convinced [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=225.9s)]
*  the election had been stolen, and she writes in her opinion, the court did state that former [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=229.5s)]
*  president was free at the time of Priolo's sentence, an undisputed fact upon which Priolo [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=233.34s)]
*  had relied for her mitigation argument. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=238.42s)]
*  But it went no further, it being the court there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=241.38s)]
*  I didn't say anything else. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=243.62s)]
*  The defense purports to detect an inescapable message in what the court did not say that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=244.94s)]
*  President Trump is free but should not be. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=249.22s)]
*  What's interesting here to me is you've got the judge before you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=251.9s)]
*  You file a motion that contorts her own statements. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=256.3s)]
*  Like she knows the context of what she said. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=261.5s)]
*  It's a wild thing to do, to try to wrench out of context statements by the very person [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=264.3s)]
*  to whom you were filing the order. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=270.06s)]
*  Especially because that's always the person who is the initial finder of fact and law [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  there, is the very person you're trying to recuse. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=278.06s)]
*  It's interesting because most lawyers may talk about, oh, you don't want to seek to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=281.54s)]
*  recuse the judge. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=285.22s)]
*  You may irritate them some. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=286.22s)]
*  That is true. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=288.22s)]
*  But I think the bigger risk for these Trump attorneys is by following Trump's lead and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=289.5s)]
*  making this very weak, attenuated recusal argument, what really hurts them isn't that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=295.26s)]
*  Judge Chutkin is going to get mad at them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=300.54s)]
*  She's a very fair jurist. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=302.86s)]
*  I used to practice with her when she was a public defender. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=304.02s)]
*  No, the problem is they're going to lose their credibility. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=306.54s)]
*  She's going to feel you're willing to make any old argument and that really hurts the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=310.06s)]
*  attorney in court. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=313.54s)]
*  Yeah, reputational capital. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=314.54s)]
*  It's a thing you draw on, right, over the course of a long trial. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=316.54s)]
*  And of course, we expect they'll appeal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=321.94s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=323.78s)]
*  It doesn't look very good in terms of the grounds of that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=324.78s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=326.5s)]
*  Sham Wu, thank you very much. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=327.5s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWJ-AQLzyQ&t=328.5s)]
