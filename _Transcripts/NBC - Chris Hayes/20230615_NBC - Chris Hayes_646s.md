# ‘The Bedminster mystery:’ Why Trump could also face charges in New Jersey
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY)
*  In the week since news first broke of the federal indictment against Donald Trump, right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=0.0s)]
*  around this time last Thursday, one name has been brought up nearly just as often as the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=3.88s)]
*  defendant himself, and that is of the judge assigned to the case, Judge Alain Cannon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=7.7s)]
*  Lots of folks have wondered whether Trump appointed federal judge can truly run an impartial [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=12.22s)]
*  trial, particularly after she flagrantly ruled in favor of the ex-president during an early [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=15.82s)]
*  legal dispute over the classified documents last summer, a ruling that was so out of nowhere [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=20.98s)]
*  that it was quickly reversed by the appellate judges. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=26.7s)]
*  But special counsel Jack Smith may have a backup plan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=30.3s)]
*  You see, while the Department of Justice charged Trump for illegally retaining the trove of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=33.06s)]
*  classified documents he stole, he was not charged with disseminating those documents, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=36.379999999999995s)]
*  even though prosecutors say he did just that twice at his New Jersey golf house. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=41.26s)]
*  As lawyers Andrew Weissman and Ryan Goodman note in The Atlantic, Trump still could be [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=46.7s)]
*  charged with dissemination, especially if the special counsel's office believes Judge [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  Cannon is putting her thumb on the scale again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=53.94s)]
*  Quote, if Alain Cannon were to seek to pocket veto the charges before her by, say, scheduling [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  the trial for after the 2024 presidential election, the special counsel will be able [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  to sidestep her tactic by proceeding with charges in New Jersey. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=65.9s)]
*  Mary McCord is the former acting assistant attorney general for National Security at [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=70.46s)]
*  the Department of Justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=74.22s)]
*  She is co-host of the Prosecuting Donald Trump podcast. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=75.66s)]
*  Deborah Perlstein is a professor at Cardozo School of Law. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=78.94s)]
*  She recently wrote an essay for The New York Times on the genius of leaving Trump's fate [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=81.74s)]
*  up to 12 ordinary Floridians. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=85.5s)]
*  Both join me now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  Deborah, let me start with you on that because it sort of gets to this question, right, of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  a fair shake and venue and doing it in Florida. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=93.22s)]
*  What do you think about the Cannon conundrum such as it is and how to sort of think about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  it and having this trial in that judge's custody with a jury in Florida? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=103.41999999999999s)]
*  So thanks. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=110.74s)]
*  It is a conundrum that the Justice Department is facing, but they've got to thread a remarkably [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=111.74s)]
*  narrow needle here in what they're trying to accomplish with this prosecution. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=117.41999999999999s)]
*  They want to obviously see justice done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  We all want to see that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  But they're up against a clock. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  That is, this needs to be wrapped up or close before the 2024 election or at least before [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=128.0s)]
*  the former president is reelected again, which remains a possibility. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=135.5s)]
*  And they have to do this in a way that not only does justice but contributes to the perception [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=139.9s)]
*  that justice is being done in a case that is this incredibly politically fraught. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=145.32s)]
*  The risks not just for the outcome of the case but for the system more broadly are enormously [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=151.38s)]
*  high. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=157.3s)]
*  Going to Florida in the first place eliminates some risks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=158.6s)]
*  They were facing a risk that, for example, venue would be challenged if the case was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=162.02s)]
*  brought in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=166.06s)]
*  The Justice Department might well have actually prevailed ultimately, but it certainly would [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=168.0s)]
*  have been litigated. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=172.58s)]
*  The former president would have been able to appeal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=173.58s)]
*  That takes time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=175.84s)]
*  Bringing it in Florida short circuits that process. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=177.16s)]
*  And if the Justice Department can prevail there, it has a Florida verdict, a better [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  chance than other options of potentially being taken seriously if it's just a bunch of ordinary [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=187.8s)]
*  Florida citizens. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=194.2s)]
*  Then does a verdict rendered by a jury in what is typically considered a bluer state [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=195.48s)]
*  like New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C.? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=200.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, on the sort of New Jersey part of this, Mary, so there's two things here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  First, let's just talk about the charging document and the indictment as read, right, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  does have a little bit of a weird Bedminster mystery to it because stuff is clearly going [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=216.28s)]
*  to Bedminster. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=222.04s)]
*  Like he's packing up enough boxes that apparently his wife calls up Walt Natter to be like, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=223.04s)]
*  please, no, no, don't bring boxes on the plane. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=227.48s)]
*  Right. So the boxes are going to Bedminster. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=230.04s)]
*  We know we have in the indictment two times showing the map to the guy from the Super [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=232.88s)]
*  Pack and the other, you know, the nuclear secrets or the plan for Iran. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=237.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=244.92s)]
*  In both those cases, that's happening at Bedminster. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=245.92s)]
*  And yet Bedminster has never searched. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=247.92s)]
*  It's not charged there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=251.0s)]
*  So what do you make of that to begin with? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=252.04s)]
*  Well, I think that the that probably Jack Smith thought it was important to include [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=255.24s)]
*  these allegations in the indictment just to just as a as a part of the storytelling of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=260.2s)]
*  this. Right. And to also signify the significance of this, because even though he did not charge [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=265.52s)]
*  dissemination of classified information or national defense information, to be more precise, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=271.32s)]
*  based on the statute that was used, it helps to tell the story of what all was going on from [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=276.68s)]
*  the time Mr. Trump left the White House on January 20th through that search through the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=282.32s)]
*  execution of the search warrant. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=287.32s)]
*  And that included not only obstructing the investigation by removing boxes, sorting [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=288.68s)]
*  through them and not putting boxes back in the storage room where his attorney came to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=295.28s)]
*  search for classified information and misleading his attorney about that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=299.88s)]
*  But it also included dissemination. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=304.8s)]
*  But it would have been more challenging to charge those dissemination counts in Florida, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  because as you just indicated and as the indictment reflects, they were shown to people in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Bedminster. Now, there's a theory of a continuing offense. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=317.36s)]
*  If the documents originated in Mar-a-Lago, they originated in D.C., went to Mar-a-Lago, then [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=320.56s)]
*  went to Bedminster. There's a theory there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=326.12s)]
*  But again, just as Deborah said, it could have delayed things because there would have been [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=328.4s)]
*  motions to change venue on those counts in Florida. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  The other thing that could be going on is, you know, it's unclear from this indictment whether [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=338.16s)]
*  the department has all of the evidence it would need to prove up dissemination. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=342.92s)]
*  In other words, does it have that document that he was showing? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=346.76s)]
*  Do we really have it showing either to the two people who are working on Mark Meadow's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=350.44s)]
*  autobiography or to the the political action committee leader? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=354.44s)]
*  And so, you know, there's still some things we don't know, but it is certainly possible that if [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=358.48s)]
*  something goes awry in Florida, it's certainly possible Jack Smith, if he does have that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=363.88s)]
*  evidence, could bring a case probably relatively quickly in New Jersey. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=368.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, I guess so the question of like, can you bring that is different than this sort of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=374.16s)]
*  broader institutional question that Deborah, you're getting at here, right, which just strikes me as [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=379.32s)]
*  like we're talking about this line, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=383.56s)]
*  You want to zealously prosecute this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=385.2s)]
*  You also want to do it in a way that projects at all times, fair play, no dirty pool, no and not [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=386.92s)]
*  and not necessarily because you're going to insulate yourself from criticism from Donald Trump and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  his, you know, his cronies. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=400.8s)]
*  That's going to happen anyway. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=403.36s)]
*  But it is it is as a sort of almost testament to the thing you're trying to preserve, Deborah, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=404.48s)]
*  right? I mean, sort of like theory and practice as one in how you go about doing this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=409.64s)]
*  It's it's really true. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=414.96s)]
*  And the prosecutor here, you know, interestingly, has prosecuted cases in more than one venue. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=416.92s)]
*  He's not only prosecuted cases in the U.S. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=421.64s)]
*  justice system, he's prosecuted international war crimes cases as well. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=423.8s)]
*  And in both cases and in here in the United States with a case of this kind of political salience, an [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  unprecedented case in U.S. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=435.4s)]
*  history of a former prosecution. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=437.36s)]
*  It's more like we see in other countries where there's a risk of does this look like politicized [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=439.36s)]
*  prosecutions? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=445.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=446.44s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=446.92s)]
*  So the criticisms we hear are not dissimilar from criticisms you hear in other countries when you [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=447.68s)]
*  face things like this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=453.52s)]
*  And he has to be, and I'm sure he is, cognizant of those and working to avoid them to the extent he [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=454.56s)]
*  can. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=461.48s)]
*  That's a very that's a very astute point. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=462.8s)]
*  I mean, you know, war crimes prosecutions have been called victor's justice since back to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=464.32s)]
*  Nuremberg, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=468.0s)]
*  When Chief Justice Roderick Jackson was prosecuting them overseas. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=468.68s)]
*  There's some more New York Times reporting on the boxes, Mary, that I think speaks to, you know, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=473.23999999999995s)]
*  just how obsessed the guy appears to be with the contents and how how much this is the opposite of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=479.68s)]
*  what you would normally claim in this case. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  Like, if anything happened to my papers, I would be like, I have no idea. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=488.28s)]
*  Like, I literally I know nowhere in my papers are. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=492.4s)]
*  I don't know what's in any box. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=495.32s)]
*  Like, honestly, I swear to you, this is the opposite here. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=496.96s)]
*  Here's the New York Times. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=499.47999999999996s)]
*  Shortly after John Kelly took over Trump's chief of staff, Kelly and other aides grew concern that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=500.88s)]
*  some documents were likely presidential actors. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=504.84s)]
*  Records might go missing if they were kept in the residence. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=507.0s)]
*  They impressed upon him. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=509.44s)]
*  The papers had to be tracked, but he was not especially interested. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=510.4s)]
*  Aides started examining the boxes to check for presidential records, but Trump still found ways to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=513.28s)]
*  bring items to the residence. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=517.28s)]
*  The boxes began to multiply. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=518.76s)]
*  He could point to specific boxes he wanted to take with him on Air Force One when he was traveling [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  and declined to take others, appearing aware of the contents inside the boxes he chose. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  What do you think the significance of that is? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=532.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting because remember, even when he was in office, there was reporting [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=534.96s)]
*  that his aides said how difficult it was to to keep him first of all, taking classified [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  information back to his office. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=546.32s)]
*  But also, if he didn't like something, he ripped it up and they would have to tape it together [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  because it was an official record. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=551.72s)]
*  So this is part of his modus operandi, I think. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=553.44s)]
*  And it's interesting because, you know, we've talked before about what was his motive here. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  Why did he retain these classified documents at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=562.32s)]
*  Why did he carry them with him everywhere? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=566.24s)]
*  And, you know, we've speculated about potential, you know, use of monetizing of these or using [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  them as leverage in his own business relationships or potentially with foreign governments or [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=574.48s)]
*  foreign companies. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=580.92s)]
*  But it's also quite possible that it was just purely his weird attachment, his own employee, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  as alleged in the indictment, called these the beautiful mind boxes that he has this weird [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=590.24s)]
*  attachment to things. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it sounds a little bit like that's a petty and not a significant motive. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=596.5999999999999s)]
*  But and it could be that there are other motives as well. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=603.0s)]
*  But but it definitely seems there's a lot of support for the fact that he really just he [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=606.12s)]
*  felt like these were his. He wanted to keep them. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=610.12s)]
*  He didn't want to give them up. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=612.2s)]
*  He's on Truth Social within the hour, all caps demanding the return of the papers to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=614.32s)]
*  him. So still focus on that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=620.28s)]
*  Mary McCord and Deborah Perlstein, thank you both. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZAOQfcdEpY&t=622.32s)]
