# ‘This is awkward for you’: Mehdi Hasan takes on Vivek Ramaswamy in new interview
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI)
*  You have probably seen all you care to see of Vivek Ramaswamy lately. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=0.0s)]
*  That is because his campaign for the Republican nomination of president is entirely based on his getting as many media hits as possible, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=4.64s)]
*  including appearing yesterday on the show of a YouTuber with a history of really gnarly anti-Semitic posts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=10.8s)]
*  The fast-talking Ramaswamy, who Chris Christie famously said sounds like chat GPT, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=17.2s)]
*  always appears unbothered by his stream of contradictions and falsehoods and never really gets nailed down long enough to be caught in them. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=22.56s)]
*  But until today, Ramaswamy had not gone up against one interviewer in particular, one who is built for just this sort of situation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=30.0s)]
*  MSNBC's own Mehdi Hassan. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=38.32s)]
*  In retrospect, he probably should have kept it that way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=40.96s)]
*  So Mehdi, I've made this really easy for everybody. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=45.36s)]
*  And I did this in the early weeks of the campaign. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=47.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=49.28s)]
*  I released 20 years of tax returns. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=51.92s)]
*  Something that no presidential candidate, let alone somebody who's successful in business, has done. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=52.4s)]
*  I challenged Democrats and Republicans alike, including the Biden family. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=56.32s)]
*  To do it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=60.4s)]
*  We have 2009 and 2010. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is, you know what I would advise? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  We have 2009. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=63.68s)]
*  Hold on, you're talking to look at them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=64.8s)]
*  I'm looking at them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=65.84s)]
*  Take $50,000. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=66.4s)]
*  2009 and 2010, you made $750,000. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=67.28s)]
*  You had the money to pay for law school. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=71.2s)]
*  You didn't need a Soros Affirmative Action Scholarship that you now criticize. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=72.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, none of this is worthy, but if you think it is, let's get to the detail. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=75.44s)]
*  That was actually the first big piece of money. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=80.56s)]
*  Well, I did worry that you say you're anti-affirmative action. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=81.84s)]
*  You took a scholarship for immigrants and their children. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=83.84s)]
*  I'm anti-affirmative action. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=85.28s)]
*  So why did you take a scholarship for the children of immigrants? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=86.64s)]
*  Which falsehood would you like me to address? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=88.08s)]
*  The financial one or the one about my views on affirmative action? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Because I can go in whichever order you'd like. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=94.48s)]
*  Did you not make $750,000? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=95.36s)]
*  On the financial piece of it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=96.48s)]
*  Not at the time that I had applied for the scholarship that fall. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=102.32s)]
*  December. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=102.88s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=103.36s)]
*  On December. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  This is awkward for you because you did. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=104.16s)]
*  You can watch that full interview today on YouTube now and on the Medi Haasan Show at [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=108.96s)]
*  7 p.m. tomorrow on MSNBC on Peacock and Medi Haasan joins me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=112.56s)]
*  Now, you're I think the best interviewer in American media. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=117.6s)]
*  Oh, you're too kind, Chris. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=123.52s)]
*  At that kind of thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  You really are. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  You're phenomenal at it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=126.55999999999999s)]
*  What is the Vivek Ramaswamy method? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=129.04s)]
*  What's been sort of amazing to me is like I feel like he's set some sort of Olympian [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=131.92s)]
*  record of glibness. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=136.16s)]
*  Just like everything is just like, well, I would simply do this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=137.44s)]
*  This is so easy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=140.0s)]
*  It's like everything is easy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=140.64s)]
*  Everything's obvious. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=141.76s)]
*  Like, it's like, well, no, not everything's that obvious. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=142.64s)]
*  What was your takeaway from from from going toe to toe with us? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=146.0s)]
*  The takeaway I had is that there are two big issues with Ramaswamy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=151.44s)]
*  One is what is his qualification to be president of the United States? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=155.28s)]
*  Fair question. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  Can we trust can we trust anything he says? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=159.04s)]
*  And those were the two themes I stuck to. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  He was a little irked by that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=162.88s)]
*  He did the kind of these are gotchas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=164.64s)]
*  Why can't we talk about substance? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=166.16s)]
*  But my point is why would I want to discuss the details of your peace plan for Ukraine [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=167.76s)]
*  before we first establish whether you should be president? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=172.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=175.68s)]
*  Like anyone can say, I've got a plan for Ukraine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  You go on the Internet right now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  100 people have opinions on Ukraine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  The issue is why this guy? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  What's he going to do about it? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=182.56s)]
*  How can we trust him? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=183.68s)]
*  And I think what I tried to do, I asked him about, you know, he used to criticize Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  and now he doesn't because he probably wants to be Trump's vice president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  So I put that to him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, the Soros stuff you just played is a man who attacks George Soros. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  He took a scholarship from the Soros family, from Soros's brother, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  an affirmative action scholarship, which he claims to hate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  And then he said, I didn't have the money for it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=202.32s)]
*  And I challenged him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=203.84s)]
*  He said, I never said that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  That's another thing he does, Chris. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=205.68s)]
*  He just denies things that are on tape. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=207.04s)]
*  I want to play that that exchange about that because he had tweeted after January 6. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=210.0s)]
*  Again, I don't know if the tweet itself was pandering at the time or what he really thought. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=213.84s)]
*  I mean, who knows where the line is, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  My suspicion is that he tweeted it because he thought it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=221.04s)]
*  But we'll see about what Trump did was abhorrent. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=223.12s)]
*  And you had an exchange over that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=227.44s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=228.64s)]
*  Yes, I want you to answer my question, Vivek. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  Three times I've asked it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=231.6s)]
*  What did Trump do that was downright abhorrent? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=232.64s)]
*  It's a simple question. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=235.76s)]
*  It's your words. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  It's on screen. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  What did he do that was downright abhorrent? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=238.88s)]
*  I believe that failing to unite this country falls short of what a true leader ought to do. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  That is why I'm in this race, is to do things differently than any prior president has done them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=248.48s)]
*  That's the hard truth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=253.6s)]
*  OK, and that's what made him a sore loser and abhorrent. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  A sore loser and abhorrent. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=257.12s)]
*  Yes, your words. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmNg689wlKI&t=258.4s)]
