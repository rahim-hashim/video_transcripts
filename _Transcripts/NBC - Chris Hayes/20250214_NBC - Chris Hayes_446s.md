# GOP senator rips Hegseth’s Ukraine remarks: Could be written by ‘fool’ Tucker Carlson
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ)
*  Today, America's foreign policy leaders are all over in Europe at the Munich Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Conference where we've been seeing Donald Trump's infamous merit-based hiring play out [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=4.78s)]
*  in all its glory this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=9.0s)]
*  When Pete Hegseth, the Fox News weekend morning host who promised to quit drinking when he [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=11.0s)]
*  became Secretary of Defense, read a statement that appeared to reverse basically 70 years [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  of US foreign policy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=20.78s)]
*  We must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=23.7s)]
*  objective. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=30.68s)]
*  That said, the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=31.88s)]
*  outcome of a negotiated settlement. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=40.2s)]
*  Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=43.7s)]
*  After all hell broke loose, Hegseth was forced to make a new statement the next day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=53.02s)]
*  I want to be clear about something as it pertains to NATO membership not being realistic outcome [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=57.52s)]
*  for negotiations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  That's something that was stated as part of my remarks here, as part of the coordination [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  with how we're executing these ongoing negotiations, which are led by President Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=69.68s)]
*  So I'm not going to stand at this podium and declare what President Trump will do or won't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=75.2s)]
*  do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=80.2s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=81.2s)]
*  You're there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=82.5s)]
*  You're the Secretary of Defense. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=83.5s)]
*  You set a policy as the Secretary of Defense working for the President. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=85.5s)]
*  Now you're like, no, we'll see what Trump does. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  This all seems to have been a bit much for the senior Republican senator who actually [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=92.94s)]
*  chairs the Armed Services Committee, who called Hegseth's original speech a rookie mistake, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=95.54s)]
*  adding, I don't know who wrote that speech. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  It's the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=102.18s)]
*  And all this was before JD Vance attacked our European allies and Donald Trump tried [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=106.58s)]
*  to shake down Ukraine for U.S. support. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=110.24s)]
*  John Brennan served as director of the CIA, and he joins me now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=113.28s)]
*  First of all, Mr. Brennan, what do you think about Hegseth also, in addition to what he [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=118.16s)]
*  said about Ukraine, he basically said, we're not going to be a guarantor of European security, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=123.92s)]
*  which was the real kind of 70-year break with the kind of global NATO order. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=127.6s)]
*  That also seems to have been walked back. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=134.12s)]
*  JD Vance seems to be sending some sort of cleanup contradictory messages. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=136.32s)]
*  What do you understand about what U.S. policy here actually is? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=140.54s)]
*  I wish I could tell you, Chris, but it's been quite clear, I think, from ever since Hegseth's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=144.98s)]
*  nomination was announced that he is unqualified and lacks the experience to be the secretary [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=151.18s)]
*  of defense. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=157.14s)]
*  And it was demonstrated quite visibly on the world stage in Munich. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=158.14s)]
*  And so again, I think it just underscores that he is way out of his league right now [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=163.1s)]
*  in terms of trying to represent the U.S. Defense Department with our foreign counterparts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=167.72s)]
*  But even more fundamentally, I think what we're seeing now with all of these different [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  statements and conflicting statements, that there's a real lack of coordination within [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=179.88s)]
*  the Trump administration on these very important policies. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Previously, in previous administrations, for something like the Immun insecurity Conference, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=190.0s)]
*  we would have a lot of pre-event meetings, discussions and coordination about what the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=194.52s)]
*  policy statements are going to be. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=198.78s)]
*  That doesn't seem to have happened here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=200.94s)]
*  And so therefore, I think it really is leaving a lot of our allies and partners scratching [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  their heads about what really is the U.S. policy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=206.82000000000002s)]
*  And it seems to be very ad hoc that they're making it up as they go along and they have [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=210.38000000000002s)]
*  to reverse course and change tack or whatever. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  So again, it was it's been an embarrassment, I think, the past couple of days in terms [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=216.34s)]
*  of what U.S. officials have been doing in Munich and beyond. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=220.3s)]
*  One thing that does seem clear, I mean, what there's a few things in clear one is Trump [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=225.16s)]
*  is going to have some sort of negotiation with Putin that Zelensky may or may not be [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=229.68s)]
*  involved in or the degree to which he's involved is as yet to be determined. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's going to happen in Saudi Arabia of all places. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  And it also seems there's been consistent. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=241.08s)]
*  There's a lot of reporting that basically what Trump is saying to Zelensky is you have [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  to give us something, including access to precious minerals in Ukraine, including rare [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=247.4s)]
*  earth, which is used for a lot of industrial processes used to make batteries and other [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=253.1s)]
*  things. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=258.78s)]
*  And being very frank about it, like essentially saying we're going to take a payment here [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=259.78s)]
*  from you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=264.66s)]
*  Or else. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=266.7s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=268.18s)]
*  Well, I think it just demonstrates that the Trump administration is going to use whatever [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=269.18s)]
*  tool it can to intimidate, to threaten others. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=274.78s)]
*  The Trump administration is coming across as very arrogant, self-centered and is going [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=278.64s)]
*  to push for its interests, irrespective of the interests of our partners and allies. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=283.08s)]
*  And that's why I think there's just real question marks about what is it that is going to come [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=289.8s)]
*  out of this if we're going to be shaking down the Ukrainian government. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=295.44s)]
*  The fact that the Treasury Secretary of the United States appears in Zelensky's office [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=299.08s)]
*  a draft contract basically giving the United States 50 percent of the rare earth minerals [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=303.18s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=308.62s)]
*  It just it demonstrates, I think, the lack of sophistication and their ignorance about [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=309.62s)]
*  what the geopolitical realities are there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=314.74s)]
*  And so therefore, I think there's a lot of questions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=317.58s)]
*  I was in Europe earlier this week, and I must tell you that the frustration and anger with [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=319.38s)]
*  the United States has never been more palpable. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=324.1s)]
*  It's off the scale because they really just see that there's been such a reverse, a 180 [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=327.3s)]
*  reverse of what the United States has stood for, especially in terms of European security, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=331.96s)]
*  that this Trump administration has a much different attitude and approach that really [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=337.64s)]
*  is quite off putting to them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=341.48s)]
*  Finally and quickly, you were at the CIA, Director of CIA, you were station chief in [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=344.48s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=348.68s)]
*  I have to ask you, Ziavi here, about the president's now repeated declarations that we're going [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=349.68s)]
*  to take over Gaza, occupy it in some way, remove all two million Palestinians from Gaza to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=353.84s)]
*  create some real estate development deal that will be owned by the U.S. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=360.06s)]
*  And what that what that does to American security and counterterrorism and intelligence in the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=364.54s)]
*  region? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=371.54s)]
*  Well, that very statement, I think, is exceptionally dangerous because basically we're telling [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=372.54s)]
*  two million Palestinians we're not only going to ignore your right to self-determination, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=377.98s)]
*  we're going to kick you out of your homeland that you've been in for many, many generations. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=381.94s)]
*  And so therefore, I think it really is quite dangerous. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=386.38s)]
*  There was a writer who wrote about this who referred to this as just sheer lunacy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=389.44s)]
*  It is sheer lunacy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=394.48s)]
*  It doesn't grasp the underlying concerns and issues that really have been the source of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=395.68s)]
*  this problem for so many years. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=400.8s)]
*  And so, you know, the fact the thought that the United States is just going to take over [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=402.68s)]
*  Gaza, push out all Palestinians and turn it into a Riviera on the Mediterranean is just [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=406.76s)]
*  totally absurd. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=411.6s)]
*  But again, I think it is very dangerous because it is engendering now a real feeling of animosity [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=412.6s)]
*  among a lot of individuals who are there toward the United States that is not going to go away. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=418.34s)]
*  John Brennan, thank you for your time tonight, sir. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=423.9s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gb6P17AOQ&t=425.42s)]
