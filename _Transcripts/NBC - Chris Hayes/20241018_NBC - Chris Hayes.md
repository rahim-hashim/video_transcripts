# Elon Musk’s ‘uniquely dangerous’ and ‘unbearably awkward’ campaign for Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec)
*  Little campaigns love micro targeting that's sending messages directly to small groups of voters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=0.0s)]
*  If you're not in the group being targeted, you may never see them. Let's look at what you're missing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=5.0s)]
*  Here are some recent political ads that were micro targeted to Muslim voters in the swing state of Michigan [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=9.24s)]
*  Vice president Harris has chosen a side for right side. Harris has made herself clear [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=16.72s)]
*  She stands with Israel and the Jewish people enjoying Kamala will be her husband and top advisor [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=21.84s)]
*  Doug Emhoff who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=27.12s)]
*  Kamala relies on her husband Doug for counsel on the toughest issues like Israel's noble fight against the radical terrorists in Gaza [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  And when Doug talks Kamala listens [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=38.6s)]
*  Kamala and Doug America's pro-israel power couple [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=42.28s)]
*  That went to Muslim swing voters now [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  That's extremely cynical and I think kind of anti-semitic like there's a Jewish puppet behind the woman [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=48.0s)]
*  Okay, that's one set of micro target ads to Muslim voters now here are some other ads [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=55.26s)]
*  Run by the same probe Trump pack being targeted to Jewish voters in the swing state of, Pennsylvania [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=60.54s)]
*  Two-faced Kamala Harris is secretly campaigning for Palestine and trying to get away with it in Jewish communities throughout America [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Questions are being asked. Why is she running ads pandering to Palestine? We must stand up to anti-semitism [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=76.82s)]
*  We say no more Kamala Harris stop pandering to Palestine and stand with our ally Israel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=82.98s)]
*  Wait, we were just told Kamala Harris stands with Israel that she's super pro-israel [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  She's part of a pro-israel power couple now are being told she stands with Palestine against Israel [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  You see the issue here, right? Those two sets of ads can't both be true. They're diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=99.62s)]
*  But they're both made by the same pro-trump political action committee to micro target and manipulate [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=105.78s)]
*  vastly different groups of voters [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=112.66s)]
*  It is the grossest most cynical ploy as seen in an election cycle. That's rotten with cynical ploys [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=114.78s)]
*  It's all made possible by the world's richest man. Elon Musk who has given [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=121.82s)]
*  75 million dollars to the super PAC that's bankrolling all of those micro targeting campaigns [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=126.5s)]
*  Musk is just one of three billionaires three people total one two three who taken together have poured [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=133.14s)]
*  220 million dollars into efforts to elect Donald Trump [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=138.44s)]
*  But Musk is unique and uniquely dangerous because remember he bought the website formerly known as Twitter [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=143.6s)]
*  He made it an absolute vector of disinformation and neo-nazi bigotry [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=148.76s)]
*  Which he sometimes personally reposts and interacts with all in the name ostensibly a free speech [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=152.94s)]
*  But of course this free speech warrior is now banning reporters and blocking links to news that Trump campaign doesn't like [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=158.36s)]
*  multiple sources tell the New York Times and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=165.04s)]
*  Now the tech tycoon is offering [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=167.68s)]
*  $100 to any registered voter in Pennsylvania who signs on to his petition in support of the first and second amendments [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=170.4s)]
*  Critics say must scheme doesn't quite break the many laws that forbid by bribing voters, but it sure does bend them pretty hard and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=176.64s)]
*  Then yesterday the SpaceX owner hit the campaign trail himself just side of outside of Philadelphia [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=184.4s)]
*  He offered up a heaping helping of election denial a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=190.88s)]
*  Lot of people on the downside will say there's no cheating [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=195.48s)]
*  There's no cheating and I'm like you you've made it impossible to actually prove that it's that they're cheating [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=197.84s)]
*  but the statistically there are some very strange things that happen that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=203.04s)]
*  That are statistically incredibly unlikely [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=208.64s)]
*  So [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=213.16s)]
*  You know there's always a question of like say the Dominion voting machines [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  It is weird that the you know, I think they're used in Philadelphia and in Maricopa County [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  But not in a lot of other places and that seemed like a kick up a coincidence [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=224.48s)]
*  Okay, few things here. Everything must said there about Dominion voting machines [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=229.2s)]
*  It's just flatly untrue as the company pointed out in a statement yesterday [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  And as we all learned last year when let's remember Fox News had to pay Dominion [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  $788 million to sell a defamation lawsuit after repeating Trump's lies about the voting machine company [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=242.72s)]
*  Trump also uses rally to bond with felon paranoid conspiracy believers [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=250.17999999999998s)]
*  Do you think there is a shadow government behind the Biden Harris administration? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=256.38s)]
*  I mean, it's this way. It's not Biden. Who is it? That's behind him. We know Obama [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=262.5s)]
*  Okay, buddy Obama. I [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  Mean I'm just as curious as you are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=274.7s)]
*  You know it is it is a [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=277.26s)]
*  As far as I can determine that there isn't any one sort of puppet master [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=279.94s)]
*  It's more like there's a thousand or a lot [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=284.94s)]
*  But it's just obvious that that Biden's on a charge. It's obvious that Kamala's on a charge [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=288.38s)]
*  I mean the Kamala's they just replaced the Biden puppet with the Kamala puppet [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=292.14s)]
*  Very obviously, so I mean, yeah, I think it's not from what I can tell is not one puppet master. It's many but [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=297.46s)]
*  You know [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=303.78s)]
*  Interesting to see the crossover between the FD and client list and Kamala's puppet masters [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=305.78s)]
*  Okay, a few things here one. It's not a shadow government. It's the actual government like they're just he's the president [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=310.61999999999995s)]
*  Congress vice president, that's the government number two. Okay. I will give him this the man is a super Nova of charisma [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=317.5s)]
*  I mean just you just an incredible stage presence and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  Finally it's pretty unnerving that the richest man in the world is just casually suggesting that there's some [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=329.26s)]
*  Unseen puppet masters who control our government and hung out with Jeffrey Epstein [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=334.78s)]
*  That's a little loud even for a dog whistle [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=340.42s)]
*  This level of cynical brain-wrought political programming out of what America's confirmed top elites a globalist himself [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=343.38s)]
*  Who's from another country is pretty much unprecedented? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean sure you had Henry Ford palling around with fashion [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  Back in the 1920s and 30s and publishing absolute filth anti-semitic bilge [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=356.73999999999995s)]
*  But Musk has wealth and access if work only dream of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  The richest man in the world has become a raving reactionary and he's partnering Donald Trump [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  The guy who wants to overthrow American democracy and Musk is doing everything in his power to get that guy elected [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=370.46s)]
*  For bankrolling lies to reposting racist conspiracy theories to even working a stage in his own [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  absolutely [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=382.26s)]
*  Unbearably awkward way [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=383.66s)]
*  What exactly is Musk expecting in return [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=386.66s)]
*  Teddy Schleifer is a New York Times reporter covering campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=389.66s)]
*  He's covered Elon Musk role in this election at length and he joins me now Teddy [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=394.74s)]
*  You're reporting on this has been great before we even get to Musk. I just want to start with just noting [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=399.82000000000005s)]
*  This came to my attention. I think something you noted that Mary Maddelson who Sheldon Adelson's widow Rick Ooline [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=404.42s)]
*  Who's a sort of manufacturing industrialist in the Midwest and Musk just the three of them putting up? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=410.14s)]
*  220 million is that right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=416.3s)]
*  Yeah, and that's just in the third quarter of this year [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=419.5s)]
*  And that's just what we know about there's we don't know about kind of any contributions that are made to dark money organizations [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  Look Democrats and billionaires too, but I don't feel like the Republican billionaires [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=427.14s)]
*  It's a very concentrated group of people and part of that is because of the guy leading the Republican ticket [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=432.06s)]
*  And part of that is because of the guy leading the Republican ticket, you know, there are plenty of wealthy, you know center-right pro-israel [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=436.58s)]
*  tax cuts tax cuts tax cuts Republican wealthy people [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=444.1s)]
*  they are obviously not the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=447.58s)]
*  Primary audience at a Trump rally and so the types of people who are donors who have rallied around Donald Trump [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=449.86s)]
*  It's a peculiar bunch. It's people like Mary Maddelson who have one issue [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=456.3s)]
*  They really care about or people like Elon Musk who just kind of want to be in the room and the Elon Musk thing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=460.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean again [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=465.66s)]
*  American history is long and we've gone through really interesting periods and you sort of famously in the late 19th century [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=467.38000000000005s)]
*  You know, there was no finance campaign finance [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  Regulation really in fact lots of it came about because of how blatantly corrupt the relationships would be between [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=476.1s)]
*  robber barons and politicians essentially sponsorship [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=482.02000000000004s)]
*  It's just hard to find something quite like the precedent here of the richest man in the entire country [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=484.54s)]
*  fully like completely behind [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  One of the major party nominees to the point that must be [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=495.70000000000005s)]
*  Sure. I mean I was at that event you showed yesterday outside of Philadelphia and like I was sitting there wondering why is this event happening? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=500.1s)]
*  You know clearly Elon is there, you know in in purpose to encourage people to register to vote in, Pennsylvania [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=506.66s)]
*  That's the state that he really cares the most about he's basically moved his operations there the voter registration deadline is Monday [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=513.1s)]
*  So the one way to think about why he's there is because he's trying to kind of create an earned media moment, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  Get people to show up get people to cover it. I'm sure some folks [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=524.12s)]
*  Registered to vote because of that event. No, it's kept another [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=527.84s)]
*  Another reason though, and this is something you do not see dick [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=532.16s)]
*  You align do or Miriam Adelson do or Reid Hoffman do or any other kind of billionaire is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=534.76s)]
*  Sometimes you think Elon Musk is the candidate, you know, he came out to a song [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=540.32s)]
*  I've heard up plenty of Trump rallies. You can see right now on the screen [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=546.0s)]
*  He was standing in front of this massive American flag at the town hall [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=548.48s)]
*  You know, he was weighing in on tons of topics that enough, you know, he would go over 10 minutes at a time [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=552.24s)]
*  Without talking about Donald Trump. It's like Elon. What do you think about AI? Elon? What do you think about? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=557.68s)]
*  Neuralink it almost reminds me of like a book author doing a talk [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=562.12s)]
*  Which is fine, but like I was baffled about what's happening [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24O9WH9Rec&t=565.72s)]
