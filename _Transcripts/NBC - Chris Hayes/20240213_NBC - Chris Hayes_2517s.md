# All In with Chris Hayes - Feb. 13  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw)
*  Tonight on All In. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=0.0s)]
*  We have the votes and we're ready to impeach. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=3.34s)]
*  Republicans take another run at impeachment as New York votes to replace a disgraced MAGA [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  member. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=11.36s)]
*  I actually went to school on a volleyball scholarship. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=12.36s)]
*  You did? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=16.04s)]
*  Tonight, what we know about the fate of impeachment and the MAGA house. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=17.04s)]
*  We're not the problem. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=22.04s)]
*  The problem is on the extreme MAGA Republican side. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=23.72s)]
*  Then how Jack Smith is responding to Trump's latest attempt to delay his trial and how [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=27.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's greatest investment keeps paying dividends as Republicans vow to block [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=32.04s)]
*  Ukraine aid on the orders of Donald Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=37.0s)]
*  For God's sake, it's dumb, it's shameful, it's dangerous, it's un-American. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=41.12s)]
*  When All In starts right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Good evening from New York. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=52.28s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=53.28s)]
*  We have a lot of late breaking news this evening. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=54.32s)]
*  In just one hour from now, polls will close in the highly contested special election in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=56.52s)]
*  New York's third congressional district. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=62.2s)]
*  That is a race to replace the disgraced former Republican Congressman George Santos. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=64.16s)]
*  Now we begin on Capitol Hill where just moments ago, the current house majority, as slim as [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=70.04s)]
*  they come, narrowly approved an impeachment of President Joe Biden's Homeland Security [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=75.88s)]
*  Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by exactly one vote along party lines with bipartisan opposition. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=81.48s)]
*  This is frankly a purely political stunt, pretty lame one at that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  There have been no high crimes or misdemeanors committed by the secretary or even to be honest, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=92.84s)]
*  really alleged. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=97.56s)]
*  There is almost zero chance he will face conviction in the Democratic Senate. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  In a new statement, President Biden slammed the impeachment writing, quote, history will [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=103.06s)]
*  not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=106.8s)]
*  that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=111.8s)]
*  This of course was their second attempt to impeach Mayorkas after the first vote failed [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=116.84s)]
*  in spectacular fashion last week. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=121.44s)]
*  That vote failed in large part because the unruling House Republican Conference has one [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=124.08s)]
*  of the narrowest majorities in history. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  And just one hour from now at 9 p.m. Eastern time, we're going to see if that narrow mega [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=131.64s)]
*  majority will expand its numbers by one or shrink even further when polls will close [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  in one of the most fiercely contested and expensive congressional special elections [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=141.2s)]
*  in recent memory. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=146.0s)]
*  New York's third congressional district, which represents parts of Queens and New York City [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=147.0s)]
*  and the New York suburbs on Long Island, voted for President Joe Biden by 10 points back [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=156.16s)]
*  The district has been trending red. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=157.44s)]
*  That is in part because the lines of the district were redrawn after the 2020 census to be slightly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=159.56s)]
*  less favorable to Democrats. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=164.72s)]
*  In 2022, it flipped for Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin by a margin of 12 points. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  And quite infamously, it also elected a guy you might remember, Republican George Santos, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=173.48s)]
*  to Congress by a little under eight points. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Santos, of course, lasted less than a year in office before suffering one of the most [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=181.2s)]
*  embarrassing flame outs in American political history. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=185.76s)]
*  Former congressman fabricated nearly every aspect of his biography, best as we can tell, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  He's currently facing trial this year on 23 felony charges related to what prosecutors [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=194.68s)]
*  say are multiple schemes and grists, including insurance fraud, campaign finance fraud, credit [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=199.48s)]
*  card fraud, and lying to Congress. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  Santos has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=208.12s)]
*  He now makes a living by selling custom videos on Cameo. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=210.56s)]
*  In his place, Republicans are running relative newcomer Mazit Pillop. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=214.4s)]
*  And on paper, she has a great Republican biography. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  Mother of seven, former member of the Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=221.92s)]
*  In reality, Pillop has proven to be a stilted candidate, which may be why she is more or [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=226.2s)]
*  less running from the press. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=231.2s)]
*  For their part, the Democrats are running a familiar face in Tom Swazee. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=233.2s)]
*  He used to represent the district before he left it back in 2022 for an unsuccessful run [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  for governor. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=241.6s)]
*  And on the one hand, this is just one House race, and whoever wins it will have to run [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=242.6s)]
*  again in November. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=246.6s)]
*  They just get it for nine months. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  But because this is the first big contest of this election year, it has generated a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=250.36s)]
*  significant amount of attention. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  Both sides have spent a combined $22 million on advertising, the majority of which has [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=257.16s)]
*  come from groups supporting Swazee. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=261.64s)]
*  It is likely to be a very, very close race. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=264.24s)]
*  Democrats are anxious, eager to read a lot into tonight's results. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Perhaps it should be Republicans who are nervous. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=271.12s)]
*  Because on the day of the election, you have a perfect example of the dysfunction of this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  House Republican conference that Mazzeo-Pillop is seeking to join. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=277.76s)]
*  The new stunt impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas does nothing to actually improve the situation [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=281.68s)]
*  of the border or the lives of the country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=286.88s)]
*  Republicans don't actually want to fix the problems of the border. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  We know this because literally within the last week and a half, they killed a very conservative [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=292.64s)]
*  and aggressive bipartisan immigration bill last week after Donald Trump issued the order [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=297.24s)]
*  for them to do so. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=302.2s)]
*  The thing is, it's always easy to identify problems, border, crime, etc. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=304.56s)]
*  It's much harder to actually come up with solutions, which is Mazzeo-Pillop or any other [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=309.36s)]
*  fellow Republicans aren't actually offering any, at least at the moment. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=313.0s)]
*  It remains to be seen as if there will be any actual electoral consequences for that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=316.88s)]
*  Steve Kornacki joins me now at the big board. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=321.6s)]
*  Steve, everyone says this is going to be a tight race. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=324.28s)]
*  It's looking that way just based certainly on the polling coming into it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=327.68s)]
*  It's a high interest race too, certainly based on the numbers we saw from people participating [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=331.16s)]
*  in early voting, voting by mail, and then the indications we're getting from the various [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=335.32s)]
*  reports today about same-day voter turnout, even with the snowstorm you've probably heard [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=339.92s)]
*  all about that is on Long Island today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=344.5s)]
*  So a couple things to look for here, and at 9 o'clock Eastern is when the polls are going [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=347.2s)]
*  to close. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=352.26s)]
*  Show you the district here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=353.26s)]
*  This is the Nassau County, Long Island portion. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=354.4s)]
*  It's going to be about 80% of the vote is going to come out of the Nassau County, you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  know, classic suburbia, a lot of New York commuters here, bedroom communities. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=361.12s)]
*  And then the other 20% or so is actually going to come from the New York City portion of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  the district. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=370.0s)]
*  This is the far edges of Queens. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=371.0s)]
*  It's really kind of suburban Queens, if you will. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=372.12s)]
*  So that's sort of the composition of the district here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=375.12s)]
*  Now you take a look, you were mentioning that voting history in 2022. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=377.92s)]
*  This was the Santos victory over the Democrat. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  It was about a seven point victory there, seven and a half point victory. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  And under these same lines, these were redrawn lines, as you mentioned, after 2020, under [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=388.56s)]
*  these same lines, Biden would have won this district by eight points. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=393.68s)]
*  So you've got a Biden eight margin under these lines to a Santos plus seven and a half margin. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=398.48s)]
*  That was a swing between 2020 and 2022. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=403.72s)]
*  Essentially, what changed in the redistricting is this portion of the district is new. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  It's more blue collar. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=411.36s)]
*  It's like Massapequa, Levittown is down in this sort of southern portion of the district. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=412.44s)]
*  This is new. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=417.36s)]
*  It's more Republican. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=418.36s)]
*  Also, more parts of Queens were added to the district in redistricting. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=419.36s)]
*  And while you see Democratic blue right there, it actually, this is an interesting thing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=423.68s)]
*  to watch for tonight, much less blue in 2022 than in 2020. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  And one of the least blue parts of New York City, there's a high Asian American population [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=433.36s)]
*  in here that really seemed to shift away from the Democrats in some pretty strong numbers. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=437.72s)]
*  In 2022, so polls are going to close at nine o'clock. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=442.32s)]
*  What we expect is going to happen is that the early vote, you know, which took place [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  a week or so before the election and the mail in vote is going to be reported out first. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=450.32s)]
*  Those are the numbers we're going to get initially. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=455.88s)]
*  And based on the registration of the ballots that's been reported publicly and just the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=458.44s)]
*  history that we know about early voting and mail voting, I think you can expect the early [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=462.28s)]
*  numbers are going to be the best that Tom Squazzie, the Democrat, gets. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=466.44s)]
*  And the question is going to be from that early vote, from that mail vote, how much [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=471.6s)]
*  does he fall off? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=475.44s)]
*  How well does Mazie-Pillip do on the same day vote today? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=476.44s)]
*  Because that's how Republicans, when they win elections, typically it is with the same [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=479.92s)]
*  day vote. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=483.72s)]
*  And that certainly seems to be the Republican strategy here is to rack up as many votes [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=484.76s)]
*  as they can on election day. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=489.04s)]
*  And again, some indications that maybe that turn on election day, a lot of Republican [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=490.04s)]
*  voters waiting till today to do that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=493.54s)]
*  So you expect a big Democratic lead early. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=495.48s)]
*  And the question is, can Pillip erase all of it and eventually move ahead herself? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=498.2s)]
*  All right, Steve Kornacki, we will be checking in with you throughout the night once the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=502.68s)]
*  polls close. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=505.68s)]
*  So you don't go anywhere and we won't either. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=506.68s)]
*  I want to bring in Sahil Kapoor, Senior National Political Reporter for NBC News, reporting [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=508.68s)]
*  live from an election night watch party for the district's Democratic candidate, Tom [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=512.86s)]
*  Squazzie. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=517.4s)]
*  Sahil, how do things look on the ground there from the Squazzie campaign's perspective? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=518.4s)]
*  Hey, Chris. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=523.8s)]
*  Well, there's less than an hour to go before polls close. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=524.8s)]
*  The vibe over here at this Tom Squazzie watch party is still early. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  The candidate has not arrived yet. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=531.12s)]
*  It's just starting to get going. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=532.92s)]
*  And the campaign tells me it feels good today, but it believes these last few hours are crucial [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=534.28s)]
*  before nine p.m. when the polls close because turnout this morning was very slow. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=539.86s)]
*  It was a very aggressive winter storm that made the road's borderline undrivable. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=544.16s)]
*  The snow stopped falling sometime around mid-afternoon. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  And at least in the polling place that I spent most of the day at, voters started piling [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=553.64s)]
*  in. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=557.76s)]
*  The turnout seemed to grow pretty substantially around that time. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=558.76s)]
*  And we've heard anecdotal evidence from around this district that that was the case as well. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=561.36s)]
*  Now, Modzi-Pillips' team was very nervous this morning as a result because of that low [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=565.6s)]
*  turnout because, as Steve just pointed out, Republicans are election day voters. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  They're relying heavily on election day turnout to try to overcompensate or to try to beat [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=574.24s)]
*  back what is likely to be a big Tom Swazi advantage early on. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=579.4s)]
*  The fact that turnout is picked up in their view as well, in Modzi-Pillips' camp's view [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=582.96s)]
*  as well, gives them some reason for hope. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=586.12s)]
*  But they still see her as the underdog. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=588.92s)]
*  They still describe her as the underdog because she's less known, she's newer to politics, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=590.72s)]
*  she doesn't have the kind of name idea as Tom Swazi does. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=594.64s)]
*  The biggest issue to watch in this race, Chris, is migration. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=597.12s)]
*  You cannot turn on the TV without seeing a bombardment of ads from both campaigns on [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=601.42s)]
*  this issue. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  Modzi-Pillips sees this as her ticket to victory. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=607.5999999999999s)]
*  Republicans keep pounding Tom Swazi on the air, trying to tie him to the left, to the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=610.1199999999999s)]
*  squad on the issue of the border. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=614.2399999999999s)]
*  He has rejected this and he is taking this pretty seriously, countering, you know, saying [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=616.88s)]
*  that he supports this bipartisan deal to toughen border and asylum laws that Modzi-Pillips [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=621.4s)]
*  opposes it, in his view, because she's taking orders from Donald Trump, because she's tied [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=625.7199999999999s)]
*  to the extremists of her party, in his view, because she doesn't want to fix the problem. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=629.56s)]
*  She just wants to use it for politics. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=633.3599999999999s)]
*  This is a fascinating early test of that Democratic argument to try to go on offense with the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=634.72s)]
*  border. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=639.32s)]
*  If it can work here, it could probably work in other suburban swing districts. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=640.32s)]
*  This is a bellwether for many other battlegrounds across the country. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  If Tom Swazi can pull this off and maybe even fight that to a draw, he's never going to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=647.88s)]
*  win on that issue, but if he can neutralize that advantage for Republicans, it could have [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  huge ramifications, not only tonight for this result, but in the battle for the House of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=655.1600000000001s)]
*  Representatives this fall and maybe even for the presidential election, given how closely [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  these two candidates track their national party's positions, the Biden and Trump positions, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  on immigration. Chris. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  All right, Saul Gabor, thank you very much. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=668.6s)]
*  Jennifer Palmieri served as the White House Communications Director for President Barack [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=670.6s)]
*  Obama as the 2016 Hillary Clinton Campaigns Communications Director. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=674.88s)]
*  She's now the co-host of MSNBC's How to Win 2024 podcast, and she joins me now. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=678.84s)]
*  So there's sort of two things I'm keeping in mind. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=684.92s)]
*  One is there's a lot that's sui generis about this race, the Santos factor, right? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=687.72s)]
*  I mean, that was just a real, a really bizarre thing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=692.52s)]
*  We hope not replicable. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=695.92s)]
*  Yeah. A district that's actually been moving, you know, the New York suburbs and New York [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=697.64s)]
*  and specifically sort of moved in different ways in the rest of the country. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=701.88s)]
*  You've got polling that shows in our most recent poll Swazi up by four points, but a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=706.64s)]
*  lot of people think it's going to be neck and neck. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=710.88s)]
*  The one place that I think there's national lessons is what Sawhill said. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=712.68s)]
*  And I'm curious if you think I mean, I think a lot of Democrats thought Trump killing the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=715.92s)]
*  border deal was a gift. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=720.72s)]
*  Right. And you have to use that gift in this kind of situation. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=722.12s)]
*  Right. So I think that and there was a poll recently that showed that people blame Biden [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=724.9200000000001s)]
*  more for the bill collapsing than Trump, which is super frustrating for Democrats like me. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=730.2s)]
*  But the margin was not as big as it normally is for Biden being appearing to for Trump [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=735.08s)]
*  having been strong on the border as opposed to to Biden. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  So I think that's how it's right. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=743.88s)]
*  It's you know, it's Swazi. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=744.96s)]
*  And if you live in this area, it is all you see is and Swazi pushing back on he is doing [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=746.64s)]
*  ads on the border. It's not it's not just it's not just Pilla going after him. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=752.52s)]
*  So if he wins and it is a tough district to win, even though he represented before, I [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=757.12s)]
*  think that it will show Democrats you can you can fight this out, but you have to be [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=761.96s)]
*  really aggressive about it. I mean, she attacked him. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  He put something on back on the air to defend himself. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=768.16s)]
*  He made a calculation to spend a lot of money on the border. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=770.84s)]
*  I don't think, though, but it's not like the suburbs of Atlanta or the suburbs of, you [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=774.04s)]
*  know, of Philadelphia here for this race. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=778.8399999999999s)]
*  This may tell this is an important race for whether or not Hakeem Jeffries becomes [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=781.76s)]
*  speaker. I'm not sure how important it is, what it tells us really about Biden, because [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=785.8399999999999s)]
*  abortion in blue states, it's hard to I think it's a big issue. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=791.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's a big issue in states where people think abortion is under [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=795.16s)]
*  it's abortion rights are under threat. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=800.12s)]
*  I don't feel that way. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=802.32s)]
*  You know, he is going swazzy is going after her on abortion. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=804.36s)]
*  I don't know if it's really hitting people in New York because nobody in New York thinks, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, maybe wrongly that abortion rights are at stake. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=811.72s)]
*  So like swazzy's right, not able to use that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=814.28s)]
*  That's a great point. So you're one of your one of your hypotheses, which I think was [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=817.28s)]
*  born out a little bit in twenty twenty two, is that the salience of abortion, which is [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=820.36s)]
*  the issue the Democrats right now probably lead the most on. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=824.32s)]
*  Yeah, is higher in states where at a state level it's been bad and people have suffered [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=826.92s)]
*  the tangible effects of rural as opposed to a state like New York, which has not been [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=831.56s)]
*  right. Like, you know, or that they feel that it's a purple state or it's a red state. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=835.28s)]
*  It could go either way. You know, like Michigan or Pennsylvania or Georgia. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=839.4s)]
*  Right. These states. So it is. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=843.24s)]
*  So he's using that as an as an as an issue. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=844.68s)]
*  But I don't know that it is so that it's going to break through the same. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=847.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, she's also sort of straddled it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=851.2s)]
*  I mean, we played clip of her saying pro-life and she thinks women should be able to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=852.72s)]
*  choose. Right. So I got to put on each. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=855.8s)]
*  Now, the other the other thing, I mean, to stay with this immigration question, right. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=860.68s)]
*  So I think if you looked at it from afar and you're just talking about issue salience [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  and I had, you know, pluffier the other night and made it funny in the line about you. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=867.52s)]
*  You have to you don't get to just play offense, right. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=870.0s)]
*  You got to play defense. So from an issue salience perspective, it's like a campaign [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=872.28s)]
*  totally fought on the terrain of like who's going to be tougher on stopping the migrants [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=876.52s)]
*  from coming. That's a very reactionary temp terrain. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=880.92s)]
*  Like that is generally not where you're going to favor a Democrat. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=884.12s)]
*  And I think actually is a real problem with the national political discourse. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=886.96s)]
*  Right. That's another thing. Republicans want to keep this issue as the most salient [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=890.24s)]
*  issue, which is why they've Trump killed the border bill. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=895.28s)]
*  It's why they're impeaching my orcas. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=897.96s)]
*  And this question of like how much you can. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=899.48s)]
*  What to do with that is sort of the big. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=903.88s)]
*  Right. I mean, I I think that, you know, for it, it's hard in New York because it is [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=905.52s)]
*  right in your face in New York City. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=911.92s)]
*  Like the migrant issue is just it's just huge there. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=914.0s)]
*  It Swasee spent a lot of time on it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=917.16s)]
*  I mean, it did feel like he was trying to make that he was on defense. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=920.64s)]
*  He tried to make it. He tried to make it offense. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=924.16s)]
*  He's his abortion rights as another as offense against her. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=926.36s)]
*  I think that the best Democrats can probably do is fight this to a draw. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=929.76s)]
*  And I think the president making, you know, I go to the border. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=933.8s)]
*  I would go to the border. Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=937.4s)]
*  And I would go to the border and I would say this is how many border agents we have [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=939.12s)]
*  here. It's more than any other president has in history. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=942.68s)]
*  This is this is the deportation. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=945.0s)]
*  The president and just the president, the president do that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=946.96s)]
*  People can draft off of him. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=950.32s)]
*  I don't think that it's going to, you know, you're not going to catch Republicans on [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  you still have that salient dilemma, right? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=956.52s)]
*  Yes, you do. Right. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=958.4s)]
*  Then you're not going to eat you. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=959.2s)]
*  But you can but you can just you can try to blunt the issue. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=959.96s)]
*  Some you can try to close the gap, some that it's not. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=963.24s)]
*  So it's not as for most people's minds. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=965.52s)]
*  One one thing that's also interesting to me is just that is the one way ration on crime, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=967.68s)]
*  which drives me a little crazy. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=971.84s)]
*  So in 2022, you know, that there was all of those New York races were about crime, like [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  totally about right. Right. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  And at that point, it was the case that violent crime was up in Metro New York. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=980.48s)]
*  So, OK, that's that's democracy. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=985.92s)]
*  A bad thing's happening. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=988.68s)]
*  More of it. People are crimes down 23 percent in New York City this year. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=989.6s)]
*  Weirdly, it doesn't seem to be an issue. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=993.96s)]
*  It does. Right. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=995.68s)]
*  Like, that's interesting. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  Like, that's a huge drop. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=998.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a huge drop. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=999.9599999999999s)]
*  And they don't. And that's you know, what's interesting about this, this I mean, in Long [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1001.28s)]
*  Island is politics here are just different than any, you know, anywhere else. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1005.0s)]
*  You think of New York as a blue state, but it's you know, they the salience of crime [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1009.8s)]
*  and immigration in this part of of of Long Island is a big deal and probably outsize [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1014.68s)]
*  anywhere else in the state and in a lot of parts of the country. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1019.76s)]
*  It's like, you know, that is like what that's what that's what that does, which is why [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  Swazi was thought to be such a good candidate for this. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1027.84s)]
*  He won Nassau County as the executive in 2001 after 9-11 when terrorism was big and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1031.2s)]
*  people were worried about crime and stuff like that because he's been like he's like a [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1039.24s)]
*  tough on crime kind of Democrat. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1041.92s)]
*  He is the guy you want in this situation. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1043.8s)]
*  But it's still it has not that it's still a crime is still considered to be a big issue [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1047.4799999999998s)]
*  there. All right, Jennifer Palmieri, thank you very much. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1053.8799999999999s)]
*  We will keep monitoring the happening in the race throughout the night. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  First, the latest timing on the battle to hold Trump accountable in court plus new [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1060.12s)]
*  concerns about his mental acuity, if you could call it that, and how Putin is getting [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1064.08s)]
*  exactly what he paid for. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1068.9599999999998s)]
*  That's all coming up. Stay with us. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1071.2399999999998s)]
*  Tonight, we are awaiting special counsel Jack Smith's response to Donald Trump's [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1072.52s)]
*  latest effort to delay the most serious case against him. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1076.24s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump and his lawyers asked the Supreme Court to block a lower court ruling [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1079.52s)]
*  that he is not immune from being prosecuted for his efforts to steal the 2020 election [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1084.44s)]
*  while president. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1089.2s)]
*  Trump is trying to stack another delay on top of that legally dubious immunity claim. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1090.44s)]
*  He wants the Supreme Court not to rule on this issue, but to wait to wait for the next [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1095.48s)]
*  court to reconsider their decision. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1100.48s)]
*  Then only then would he go to the Supreme Court for another appeal. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1102.88s)]
*  Of course, is the point delay, delay, delay. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1106.3200000000002s)]
*  Now, the question will come. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1109.04s)]
*  It will all come down to one question. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1110.04s)]
*  Are there enough partisan Trump appointees on the bench, specifically the Supreme Court [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1112.48s)]
*  bench willing to collaborate with him and rob voters from knowing if he is guilty or [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  innocent of his actions? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1122.72s)]
*  And the question is, is there enough evidence that Trump is guilty of his actions? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1124.68s)]
*  Is Trump guilty or innocent before Election Day? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1129.3600000000001s)]
*  Joining me now is Leah Lippmann. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1133.2s)]
*  She's professor at University of Michigan Law School, co-host of the Strict Scrutiny [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1134.2s)]
*  podcast, along with Melissa Murray and my wife, Kate Schock. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1137.76s)]
*  It's good to have you, Leah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1140.92s)]
*  All right. So one thing that I've been struggling with here is that to track all this, you [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1141.96s)]
*  have to get in the procedural weeds, but it is in the procedural weeds where like the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  fate of the country's democratic decision making is either going to live or die. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1151.96s)]
*  What is Donald Trump asking for from the Supreme Court? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1156.76s)]
*  He's asking them for a stay, basically to put the D.C. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1161.8s)]
*  Circuit's ruling on hold. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1164.68s)]
*  And that ruling had allowed the proceedings in the trial court to kick back up again and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1166.4s)]
*  potentially proceed to trial. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1171.04s)]
*  He's not technically asking the Supreme Court, as you noted, to decide the immunity issue [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1172.84s)]
*  for itself. But I think it's likely that the Supreme Court will treat Trump's application [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1177.2s)]
*  for a stay as not just an application for a stay, but also a petition for certiorari, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1181.4s)]
*  so that if it grants a stay, it will also indicate that it will hear the case and schedule [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1186.36s)]
*  it for argument. Or at least that's my hope. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. What now what he wants them to do is not that right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1192.7199999999998s)]
*  What he wants them to do just to spell this out, he wants to say, pause on that. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1195.9199999999998s)]
*  And then we're going to go around. We're going to appeal. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  There's something called on bank review, right, which is we have a three judge panel. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1202.24s)]
*  Now we want the whole all of the D.C., all the 11 judges, then they'll issue a ruling. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1205.52s)]
*  Then if we lose that, then we'll come back to you. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1210.8s)]
*  But they're not going to let him do that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1213.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1215.24s)]
*  I certainly hope not. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1217.36s)]
*  And it's part of what is so audacious about his ask is he's not just, as you know, asking [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  for a stay of that decision. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1224.32s)]
*  He's also effectively asking the Supreme Court to modify the D.C. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1225.84s)]
*  Circuit's mandate, because the D.C. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1229.8s)]
*  Circuit had said if you Trump asked the full on bank D.C. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1231.3999999999999s)]
*  Circuit to review this decision, then that's not actually going to pause any proceedings [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1235.12s)]
*  in the district court. So it's not just that Trump is asking the Supreme Court to put the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1240.4399999999998s)]
*  D.C. Circuit's decision on hold. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1244.48s)]
*  He's asking them to do that, but also modify their mandate so that he can further run out [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1246.16s)]
*  the clock, not by asking the Supreme Court to issue the decision, but also the full D.C. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1250.56s)]
*  Circuit to do so as well. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  OK, this is what I mean about the procedural weeds is where this lizard dies. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1257.24s)]
*  So the point being that the D.C., the three judges on the D.C. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1260.28s)]
*  Circuit thought of this. They knew this. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1262.96s)]
*  They basically said, look, dude, if you're going to try to add an extra step in here, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1264.96s)]
*  which is this extra step of review, the clock starts ticking again. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1268.8400000000001s)]
*  The mandate goes back to Judge Chutkin and she starts the machine back up and you start [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1272.36s)]
*  having pretrial motions and everything and you start going towards a trial. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1276.28s)]
*  So if you want to do that, fine. But it kicks up. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1279.04s)]
*  So he's now going to the court and saying, stop them from doing that. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1281.16s)]
*  Pause that indefinitely while I appeal. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1285.0s)]
*  So the other question, I guess, is what is the timeline for the court's decision now? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1288.36s)]
*  So we don't really know. The Supreme Court requested a response by the 20th. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1295.84s)]
*  They could have done so more quickly, you know, in the past, when the Trump [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1300.48s)]
*  administration had previously asked the Supreme Court to allow them to enforce [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1303.4s)]
*  the migrant protection protocol, you know, the Supreme Court requested a response [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1306.84s)]
*  within three days. And in the waning days of the Trump administration, when the [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1310.2s)]
*  Trump administration brought back the death penalty and they asked the Supreme [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1313.36s)]
*  Court to vacate a bunch of stays or pauses on execution, the court acted on [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1317.2s)]
*  those within days. So the Supreme Court requested a response by February 20th. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1320.88s)]
*  But it's possible that Jack Smith will act more quickly and will file a response [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1325.16s)]
*  before that. And then that would allow Donald Trump to file his reply and the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1328.96s)]
*  Supreme Court to potentially act on the stay request and potentially treat it as [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1333.32s)]
*  a petition for certiorari, you know, within a week, if not before. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1337.0s)]
*  But they certainly did not act as though this is a very timely, urgent manner in [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1341.64s)]
*  a way that you would hope they recognize it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1347.96s)]
*  So that's an important thing. We're all reading tea leaves here. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1350.68s)]
*  But you think that you think that week is that week does not indicate a court [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1352.68s)]
*  working at the speed and sense of urgency that they need to have. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1357.1599999999999s)]
*  It does not. It also isn't necessarily a super long time, but it also is not [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1362.4799999999998s)]
*  indicative of a court that understands this is a pure delay tactic. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1367.8799999999999s)]
*  And every week, every day you give him is just increasing the risk that no trial is [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1371.4799999999998s)]
*  going to happen before the November election. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's a little ironic because last week when the Supreme Court heard the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1378.6799999999998s)]
*  disqualification argument, all we heard about was the court's obsession with the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1382.28s)]
*  consequences of its ruling. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1386.24s)]
*  They didn't care about what the text of the Constitution said. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1387.92s)]
*  They didn't care what the history said. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1390.64s)]
*  All they cared about was the possible implications of their ruling. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1392.4s)]
*  And now the implications of their lack of urgency here is increasing the risk that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1396.08s)]
*  Trump is not going to face any accountability in federal court for his actions related [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1401.4s)]
*  to January 6th before the election. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1405.72s)]
*  So they should be made to own those consequences if they suddenly care about [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1407.56s)]
*  consequences some of the time in cases involving Donald Trump. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  That's very well said, Leah Lippman. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1415.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1416.8s)]
*  All right. Dumb, shameful and un-American, how Vladimir Putin's investment in Donald [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1420.32s)]
*  Trump is paying off. That's next. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1426.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is very likely the Republican nominee for president, but he's more than [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1433.56s)]
*  just a candidate for office. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1437.28s)]
*  He was actually the president before. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1438.6799999999998s)]
*  People seem to have weirdly blocked it out, maybe because the whole thing was so [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1441.3999999999999s)]
*  traumatizing. But I assure you, he was there. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1444.8799999999999s)]
*  He has an actual record. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1447.6399999999999s)]
*  In that record, he did everything in office as president to undermine NATO, falsely [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1449.36s)]
*  painting it as a kind of protection racket in which the members were not paying him [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1454.36s)]
*  enough tribute. Trump even tried to get the U.S. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1457.76s)]
*  to leave the alliance it founded altogether, according to multiple counts from people [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1460.84s)]
*  inside his administration. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1465.68s)]
*  He also did everything he could to encourage Russian aggression against NATO. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1467.48s)]
*  He famously sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1471.2s)]
*  agencies in public about Russian sabotage of the 2016 election. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1475.28s)]
*  In that context, what he said this weekend was fully in line with his thinking, though [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1480.4s)]
*  unhinged even by his standards. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1484.36s)]
*  One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, well, sir, if we don't pay [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1487.56s)]
*  and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1493.16s)]
*  I said, you didn't pay your delinquent. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1496.2s)]
*  He said, yes, let's say that happened. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1499.68s)]
*  No, I would not protect you. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1502.12s)]
*  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1503.6s)]
*  You got to pay. You got to pay your bills. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1506.76s)]
*  Now, first of all, it almost certainly didn't happen whenever it gives you like a yes, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1510.0s)]
*  sir, story. But that aside, I was a little surprised to see several major news outlets [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1513.52s)]
*  fail to cite an obviously relevant piece of context, which is that Vladimir Putin [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1518.3999999999999s)]
*  is desperate to reach a negotiated settlement to steal a big chunk of Ukraine and is [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  counting on the Republican Party in the U.S. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1528.12s)]
*  to essentially aid him by cutting off aid to the beleaguered army of Ukraine, which [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1530.1999999999998s)]
*  is quite literally running out of ammunition. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1534.3999999999999s)]
*  You know who did point out that context? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1537.1599999999999s)]
*  President Biden in brief remarks today that called for funding Ukraine and blasted [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1539.04s)]
*  Trump's comments. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1543.7199999999998s)]
*  Can you imagine a former president of the United States saying that the whole world [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1544.64s)]
*  heard it? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1549.5600000000002s)]
*  The worst thing is he means it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1551.5200000000002s)]
*  No other president of our history has ever bowed down to a Russian dictator. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1553.96s)]
*  Let me say this as clearly as I can. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1558.5600000000002s)]
*  I never will. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1560.92s)]
*  For God's sake, it's dumb. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1563.16s)]
*  It's shameful. It's dangerous. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1564.76s)]
*  It's un-American. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1566.16s)]
*  And of course, Putin made an enormous investment in Trump personally, one that has been [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1568.3600000000001s)]
*  paying enormous dividends. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1572.64s)]
*  He personally authorized a Russian operation to support a, quote, mentally unstable Donald [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1573.64s)]
*  Trump in the 2016 presidential election, as The Guardian put it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1577.8400000000001s)]
*  And now Trump effectively runs the Republican Party and is, for all the world, acting like [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1581.72s)]
*  a man who wants to continue pleasing his patron, Putin. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1585.8400000000001s)]
*  He is going to do what he can to not only destroy the NATO alliance, but to make Ukrainian [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1590.24s)]
*  resistance to Russian aggression impossible. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1593.76s)]
*  And Trump's comments are reverberating around the world. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1597.3600000000001s)]
*  Sending Europeans into equal parts rage and panic. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1599.52s)]
*  Here at home, the Republican Party base is under Donald Trump's thumb. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1602.76s)]
*  The Senate just overwhelmingly passed a bill to send military aid to Ukraine, Israel and [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1606.16s)]
*  Taiwan. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1610.72s)]
*  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson says his Trumpy majority is probably not even going [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1612.08s)]
*  to take the bill up for a vote in Congress. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1616.96s)]
*  Just think about the incentives Putin had in 2016, the lengths that he went to to help [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1620.44s)]
*  get Trump elected. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1624.84s)]
*  Criminal sabotage of an American government. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1625.84s)]
*  We've talked at length about how desperate Trump is to get back in the White House in [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1627.6s)]
*  hopes of eluding jail time and not, you know, possibly dying in prison. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1631.0s)]
*  Think about the stakes for Putin now, as his war drags on and he desperately wants to end [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1636.04s)]
*  it with a Russian victory. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1640.44s)]
*  And he has this one figure in his pocket singing his tune to half of America's two party [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1641.52s)]
*  system. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1646.48s)]
*  Which is to say, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin need each other with a coincidence of [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1648.52s)]
*  interests they hope will be a result of the Trump administration. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1652.76s)]
*  Interests they hope will be stronger than NATO, stronger even than American democracy. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1656.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has sort of been decomposing in front of our eyes for so long, it's hard [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1664.3600000000001s)]
*  to track the trajectory. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1668.08s)]
*  I mean, he is, after all, the guy who talked about shining UV light inside people's [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1669.8s)]
*  orifices or alternately injecting bleach in order to cure them of COVID. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1674.4s)]
*  He said that in public from the White House podium. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1679.2s)]
*  I rewatched that clip today and it drove home to me how all the stupidity, insanity, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1681.88s)]
*  hostility of Donald Trump's term has been kind of sanded down to just goofy in a lot [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1686.48s)]
*  of people's remembrances. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1691.2s)]
*  Today, in a column titled Trump is Losing It, New York Times opinion columnist Jamal [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1693.0s)]
*  Bowie compared Trump's feebleness to the breathless coverage of President Biden's age. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1697.48s)]
*  Quote, Biden may be unable to do the job at some point in the future. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1701.2s)]
*  Trump, it seems to me, already is. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1704.7600000000002s)]
*  One of those is a lot more concerning than the other. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1706.44s)]
*  And Jamal Bowie, New York Times opinion columnist joins me now. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1709.08s)]
*  Jamal, I liked your column. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1712.6799999999998s)]
*  And one of the things, and this is a hobby horse of mine, so I'll just write it for a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1713.9599999999998s)]
*  moment, which is I do think that because people don't see him speak at length [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1716.84s)]
*  extemporaneously much anymore, they've lost sight of just how completely incoherent [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1722.12s)]
*  he sounds when he does. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  No, I think that's right. I think Trump's great. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  One of the great political advantages is that when he's at a public view, people just [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1732.52s)]
*  forget about him and everything they don't like about him is not in their face. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1737.4s)]
*  But if you just watch his recent appearances at rallies, at public events and such, he's [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1742.64s)]
*  incoherent. And I believe it's in the column. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1750.5600000000002s)]
*  He speaks in gibberish and it's very striking to watch. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1752.68s)]
*  Yeah. Say more about that, because he's always been sort of one for tangents, but it is [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1756.72s)]
*  notably harder to make your way through the logic of what he is saying than it was even a [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1765.24s)]
*  few years ago, I find. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1771.0800000000002s)]
*  I agree. There is one clip I watched of him attempting to explain a missile defense system, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1773.88s)]
*  and he goes from sort of like a relatively cogent sort of like, you know, we build these [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1779.72s)]
*  things for other countries into what took me a sec to really figure out what he was [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1784.72s)]
*  saying, like a description of how it works. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1788.72s)]
*  But in sort of the kind of elliptical nonsensical Trump fashion, it was very strange to [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1791.3200000000002s)]
*  watch. And I imagine, I've been to my fair share of Trump rallies, I imagine that in the [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1797.88s)]
*  moment, especially if you're there as a supporter, it kind of just flies over you. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1802.4s)]
*  But I have to imagine that someone who just doesn't really think much about Trump and you [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1807.0s)]
*  just plop them right there and you said, try to make sense of this, it would be hard. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1811.4s)]
*  And certainly, if the current president were speaking in that manner, it would be a [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1816.16s)]
*  legitimate scandal. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1821.76s)]
*  There's also the fact that, again, there's always a certain amount of incoherence baked in [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1823.88s)]
*  that it can be hard. It's hard to gauge over time. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1828.88s)]
*  I mean, part of this because I mean, look, when you look at Donald Trump from the 1990s, it's [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1831.32s)]
*  clear, right, that he's aged considerably. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1836.0s)]
*  And that same is true of Joe Biden. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1837.92s)]
*  When you look at Joe Biden as a senator, you know, when he's 40 or 45, like he's much [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1839.32s)]
*  younger man and he speaks very differently considerably. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1843.32s)]
*  But Trump saying nonsense and incoherent things has been such a again, it's like so [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1846.76s)]
*  many things about him that seems baked in and thus unremarkable and then thus not a [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1853.72s)]
*  news story. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1857.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1859.96s)]
*  That's a real dynamic. That is the dynamic. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1862.68s)]
*  And I find it troubling because, as you mentioned earlier, he was president. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1864.72s)]
*  And it seems it seems so strange to me that he is discussed so much coverage of him [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1869.6399999999999s)]
*  talks, essentially speculation. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1874.9199999999998s)]
*  But no, he was he was president of the United States for four years. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1877.56s)]
*  I remember it. I saw it. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1880.56s)]
*  And his NATO riff over the weekend, that would have been that would be troubling even [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1882.84s)]
*  for just a candidate. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1890.28s)]
*  But he he was president and he should know and and treating it as if it's like, oh, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1891.76s)]
*  that's just Trump doing his thing. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1896.44s)]
*  My view is, no, that's not just Trump doing his thing. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1899.48s)]
*  That's the former president of the United States demonstrating not even that he has [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1902.0s)]
*  like a different difference of opinion with regards to NATO, but they doesn't [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1906.92s)]
*  understand what the thing is. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1910.24s)]
*  Yes. I mean, I think at many basic levels, he does not understand the most big things [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1912.72s)]
*  of health insurance, what Medicare is, the difference between Medicare and Medicaid, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  like basic things that you would expect to present. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1921.6000000000001s)]
*  We also saw, I mean, to me, the big thing that we've blocked out is covid because we [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1924.6s)]
*  saw how that lack of knowledge, curiosity, that incoherence all came together in the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1929.9199999999998s)]
*  response and the ludicrous things from the saying from the, you know, the White [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1935.48s)]
*  House, the inability to actually like process and make decisions about new information [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1941.36s)]
*  to a tangible like effect in terms of how bad the response was. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1947.0s)]
*  And again, that was where it all happened and it all happened before us. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1950.9199999999998s)]
*  But I do think people have blocked it out. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1954.32s)]
*  Trump has gotten some kind of covid mulligan that, oh, that's just, you know, who could [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1957.3999999999999s)]
*  have predicted the pandemic? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1961.52s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1962.72s)]
*  The job of presidency of the presidency is being prepared for crises. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1965.12s)]
*  That's that's all it is. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1969.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. We judge presidents historically over how they handle crises. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1971.36s)]
*  As you know, I'm someone who's very interested in 19th century history. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  The reason we think of James Buchanan as a failed president because he was met with a [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1978.92s)]
*  crisis mounting secession talk and he failed to handle it or deal with it in a way that [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1983.1200000000001s)]
*  helped the country survive. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1989.5600000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump faced a crisis and that's the job and he failed to handle it. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1991.16s)]
*  And so it's strange that so many Americans and I think a lot of coverage has given him [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=1997.0s)]
*  a mulligan as if it doesn't count. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2003.88s)]
*  No, this is precisely the thing that counts the most. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2005.48s)]
*  I could not agree more about this is a recurring theme we actually talked about on my [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2008.92s)]
*  podcast, Why is this happening this week with Eric Kleinberg, who's got a new book out [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2013.3200000000002s)]
*  about that year, about 2020 revisiting it, which again, people have blocked out for [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2017.2s)]
*  totally understandable reasons of emotional health. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2021.92s)]
*  But but but speaking to that mulligan, I think it's really important to reexamine [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2025.0s)]
*  Jamal Bowie. Thank you very much. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2029.72s)]
*  Thank you. All right, we're just minutes now away from the polls closing in that New [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2032.2s)]
*  York third congressional district special election where Democrats have pulled out all [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2037.2s)]
*  the stops to replace George Santos, a fellow New York Democrat, New York, your [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2040.8400000000001s)]
*  congressman, Dan Goldman joins me on that next. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  Polls in New York's third congressional district race on the northwest section of [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2056.2400000000002s)]
*  Long Island close in just about seven minutes with the razor thin Republican majority in [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2059.92s)]
*  the House. The entire Democratic Party has really put everything into this race. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2064.68s)]
*  So has the local Republican Party and national Republicans. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2068.3999999999996s)]
*  But a late complicating factor is the intense snowstorm that hit the New York metro area [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2072.16s)]
*  late last night and today, potentially impacting turnout, although that has eased. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2075.96s)]
*  As you watch the numbers come in, remember the early results will likely skew Democratic [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2080.96s)]
*  because of the Republican distrust of early voting. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2085.7999999999997s)]
*  Thanks to the snow, how tonight plays out is still very much up in the air. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2088.68s)]
*  Joining me now is Congressman Dan Goldman, Democrat in New York's 10th district. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2093.08s)]
*  He led the effort to expel George Santos, a successful effort that has resulted in [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2096.72s)]
*  tonight's special congressman. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2101.6s)]
*  I want to ask you about New York three. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2103.16s)]
*  But first, I just want to ask you about what happened in the House today where there was a [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2104.6s)]
*  vote, the second vote to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, which passed by one, a one vote [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2108.56s)]
*  margin, three Republicans voting against all Democrats voting against Republicans passing [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2113.2s)]
*  it. What do you think about what happened in your chamber? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2119.08s)]
*  Just a few hours ago, I think it's shameful and it's just a doubling down on a political [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2122.16s)]
*  stunt that gets nothing done and is purely designed to provide election fodder for Donald [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2129.3599999999997s)]
*  Trump and the Republicans. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2136.0s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas has done what he can do within the bounds of legislation and the fact [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2137.96s)]
*  that these House Republicans refuse to support a bipartisan legislation that came out of [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2143.3999999999996s)]
*  the Senate and instead want to use this political stunt to impeach a secretary of Homeland [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2150.32s)]
*  Security for essentially a policy dispute at best demeans and debases not only the [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2158.2400000000002s)]
*  Constitution, but this institution itself, the House of Representatives. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2164.6400000000003s)]
*  It also seems I mean, you've got a strange sort of confluence right where this this [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2169.44s)]
*  border deal that was worked out in the Senate after four months of negotiations gets killed by [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2173.96s)]
*  a combination basically Donald Trump, Mike Johnson, then this vote. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2178.64s)]
*  Now, Mike Johnson saying he's not going to pass anything unless he gets some border deal. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2182.56s)]
*  But they tried a border deal that got ripped up like it seems a little bit like you guys are [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2186.64s)]
*  stuck like a Roomba in the corner of a room. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2191.08s)]
*  Well, let's not say you guys because we all are interested in working out bipartisan agreement and we [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2194.8399999999997s)]
*  support the national security, international security supplemental that's come over from the [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2202.24s)]
*  Senate. President Biden went to great lengths to forge a compromise that Secretary Mayorkas, by [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2207.72s)]
*  the way, was very involved in negotiating while he was being impeached. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2214.08s)]
*  Right. So what we yeah, what we are seeing is the House Republicans said we're not doing [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2218.36s)]
*  foreign aid unless we do the border. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2223.92s)]
*  So the Senate did the border in a bipartisan way. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2225.8s)]
*  And then Donald Trump came over the top and said, no, no, no, no, no, we don't actually want to do [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2229.6000000000004s)]
*  the border. So now they just do the foreign aid. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2233.44s)]
*  Then it comes back to the House and the House says, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we can't do [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2235.92s)]
*  foreign aid without addressing the border as if the last four months did not just happen. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2240.0800000000004s)]
*  It is cynicism and hypocrisy at its zenith, Chris. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2245.48s)]
*  And it is a reflection of today's do nothing Republican Party. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2249.2000000000003s)]
*  So you you and your colleagues have been very invested in this in this race in New York, three, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2254.32s)]
*  obviously, it would it would narrow that very slim majority even further. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2259.44s)]
*  What's your sense of the politics of this race at this moment, particularly in a state that where [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2264.2400000000002s)]
*  Democrats really underperformed in 2022 relative to the rest of the country? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  Look, I think the New York three is a very emblematic district of the five or six swing [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2276.08s)]
*  districts in New York, where there are many issues that are specific to kind of the ring around [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2281.88s)]
*  New York City. The immigration issues and the migrant crisis is on top of everyone's mind, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2288.48s)]
*  including ours and especially Tom Swazis. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2293.92s)]
*  The issues related to taxes are high on the list of everyone's mind. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2297.56s)]
*  And Tom Swazis has been a leader in trying to reduce property taxes in New York three. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2301.4s)]
*  And so what we have effectively is somebody running to replace George Santos from his same party who [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2307.52s)]
*  has shady financial disclosures, who has inconsistent and flip flopping positions on abortion, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2314.96s)]
*  on assault weapons, on border, on Donald Trump, but ultimately has made it very clear that she will [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2322.3199999999997s)]
*  just be a rubber stamp to Mike Johnson and Donald Trump because she also opposed the bipartisan [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2328.4s)]
*  border security legislation. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2333.56s)]
*  And she also has said that she will follow Donald Trump and supports Donald Trump and Mike Johnson. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2335.64s)]
*  On the other hand, you have Tom Swazis, who is it was a three term congressman from this district, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2343.24s)]
*  has a history of bipartisanship and represents this district as well as anyone possibly could. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2347.84s)]
*  And it's just an interesting time. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2355.56s)]
*  It's sort of a snapshot in time in our national discussion where a lot of these issues are swept [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2357.8s)]
*  to the side and it becomes a purely national election. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2364.84s)]
*  And that's part of the reason why the Republican candidate has been able to hide for two months [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2367.92s)]
*  and no one even knows what her real positions are because this has been nationalized. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2372.04s)]
*  There's one local issue I just want to ask you about because it has been a national issue, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2377.1600000000003s)]
*  which is crime. And it was a huge issue in 2022. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2380.92s)]
*  And I was saying this earlier in the show, but in 2022, like crime was going up, like the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2384.56s)]
*  measurements we had of it, violent crime had increased in 2020 and 2021, property crime [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2389.4s)]
*  increased. Is there a way to just do people realize that crime in New York City is down 23% this [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2393.76s)]
*  year, which is one of the most significant year over year drops ever recorded in the city? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2399.44s)]
*  I know that no one's supposed to pay attention when it goes down, but it just feels like maybe [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2404.92s)]
*  people should know that. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2409.76s)]
*  You know, there are two components, I think, to public safety. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2411.6s)]
*  One is the data, which you are correct, is going down. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2414.52s)]
*  And the other is how people feel. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2417.7999999999997s)]
*  You cannot convince people that what they're feeling is wrong because you give them data. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2419.7599999999998s)]
*  But a lot of what is on people's minds as it comes to public safety is the degree of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2424.64s)]
*  randomness of crime. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2430.3199999999997s)]
*  The more random it is, the more unsafe it feels. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2432.52s)]
*  If it's between known associates, for example, then it doesn't feel like it might affect [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHFSMw5ggNw&t=2435.16s)]
