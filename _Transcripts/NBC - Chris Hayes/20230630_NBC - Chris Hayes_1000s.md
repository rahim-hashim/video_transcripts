# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 29
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today in a landmark ruling that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=0.0s)]
*  overturns decades of president sweeps aside generations of arguments about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=4.18s)]
*  racial justice and inequality, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision, six [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=8.22s)]
*  conservatives to the three liberals, effectively got rid of the use of race [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=13.32s)]
*  in college admissions at all, even for the purposes of increasing diversity. In [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=17.96s)]
*  the wake of the decisions, many colleges and universities immediately sent [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=22.48s)]
*  alumni outlining how they're going to operate going forward. One such school [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=27.04s)]
*  was the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, which is notable because [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=32.32s)]
*  that is the alma mater of Justice Clarence Thomas, whose decades-long [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=37.08s)]
*  project to destroy affirmative action culminated in a victory today. Thomas [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=40.68s)]
*  did not write the court's majority opinion that was written by Justice [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=45.68s)]
*  Roberts, but he did write a fiery 58-page concurrence denouncing race as a factor [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=48.36s)]
*  in admissions as policies that, and I quote him here, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=53.6s)]
*  Clarence Thomas did not always think this way. In the late 1960s, when he was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=62.88s)]
*  at Holy Cross, he was one of just a few dozen black students at that college. As [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=67.52s)]
*  Joel Anderson writes for Slate, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=72.12s)]
*  the school had not had many black students, and it went out looking for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=83.6s)]
*  some, and once he got to Holy Cross, well, Thomas's politics there were [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=86.72s)]
*  downright radical. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=90.83999999999999s)]
*  He definitely was inspired by the Black Panthers. He dressed like them. He talked [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=92.88s)]
*  like them. He had a beret. He had army fatigues, and he had the army boots. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  He wore afro. He was out there with everyone else. After completing his [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=106.32s)]
*  undergraduate degree, Thomas was accepted at a number of prestigious law [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=111.88s)]
*  schools, including Harvard, but he chose to attend Yale Law because he believed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  the campus's liberal politics best aligned with his own. Well, there, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=118.96s)]
*  however, Thomas became disillusioned with his own status at that elite [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  university. As New York Times reported back in 1991, Thomas was accepted to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  Yale as part of the school's explicit affirmative action plan to admit more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=130.2s)]
*  students of color, but he resented any suggestion that he received any special [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=134.4s)]
*  consideration because of his race, and once he graduated from Yale Law, Thomas [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=138.8s)]
*  blamed his initial inability to find work in the legal profession not on the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=143.2s)]
*  fact that many legal institutions and law firms in the 1970s were still [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=148.4s)]
*  redoubts of racism and white supremacy and had racist hiring practices and did [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=154.08s)]
*  not want to hire him, but rather on the belief that his degree had been tainted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=158.68s)]
*  by the implication of affirmative action. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=164.72s)]
*  He had his Yale Law degree, and he had a 10-cent stamp stuck to it, like a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  10-cent price tag stuck to it. He was like, yeah, this is what it's worth, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  right? 10 cents, so I know more. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=177.88s)]
*  He came to blame affirmative action for the rejection he felt. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=183.0s)]
*  Now I knew what a law degree from Yale was worth when it bore the taint of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=189.72s)]
*  racial preference. I was humiliated and desperate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=194.04s)]
*  Eventually, Thomas found a job in the office of the conservative Missouri [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=198.56s)]
*  attorney general John Danforth, who recently told the Slow Burn podcast that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=201.72s)]
*  he hired Thomas in part because of his race. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=205.92s)]
*  My ambition was that the AG's office was to be the best law office in the state. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=209.96s)]
*  Now, did I also think that it was important to have a diverse office? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=216.56s)]
*  Yes, I did. And did I think that it would be wonderful to hire Clarence Thomas [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=220.84s)]
*  for that reason? Yes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=225.92s)]
*  But the most important reason was I had to get the job done. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=228.04s)]
*  From there, Thomas' star continued to rise in conservative legal circles, a rise [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=232.96s)]
*  that, according to his ex-girlfriend, was again predicated in part on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=237.0s)]
*  affirmative action. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=241.04s)]
*  In 1982, the White House offered Thomas a big promotion, the chance to run his own [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=242.8s)]
*  federal agency. The trouble was that agency was the Equal Employment [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Opportunity Commission. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=252.96s)]
*  This was exactly the kind of role Clarence Thomas didn't want, a position [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=254.6s)]
*  focused on race and discrimination. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=258.64s)]
*  He didn't want to be there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  He was resentful that he had not been offered something that a white person [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=262.6s)]
*  would want. Thomas was in a bind. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=268.36s)]
*  He wanted to keep rising in the administration, but he didn't want to rise [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  this way. He didn't want anyone to think that he had gotten a job because he was [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=274.88s)]
*  black. Of course, every job he had ever gotten was because he was black. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=282.12s)]
*  Now, I want to be absolutely clear here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=289.52s)]
*  No one is saying that Clarence Thomas was unqualified for any of the long list [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  of jobs. Even his critics, his harshest critics of his jurisprudence, will [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=295.24s)]
*  concede, can concede, that he is undoubtedly one of the most, if not the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=300.64s)]
*  most, important and influential legal minds of his generation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  But that mistaken belief that race-based consideration, diversity-based [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=309.2s)]
*  consideration, and some elusive concept of true merit, abstracted from that, are [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=314.04s)]
*  mutually exclusive, is the foundational lie on which today's Supreme Court [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=318.96s)]
*  decision was built. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=323.32s)]
*  It was that belief, however, that helped secure Thomas's legal legacy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=325.6s)]
*  Thomas was eventually appointed to the D.C. Court of Appeals by President [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=329.84s)]
*  George H.W. Bush, and just two years later, Bush nominated him to the Supreme [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=332.8s)]
*  Court to replace the retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall, at that point, the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=336.64s)]
*  only black person to ever sit on the nation's highest court. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=341.48s)]
*  The president called Thomas the best qualified person for the job and denied [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=346.56s)]
*  that he selected Thomas to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall because he's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=350.84s)]
*  black. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=355.08s)]
*  And the fact he's minority, so much the better. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=356.16s)]
*  But that is not the factor. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=358.8s)]
*  And I would strongly resent any charge that might be forthcoming on quotas when [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=360.36s)]
*  it relates to appointing the best man to the court. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=366.56s)]
*  Again, same thing here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=369.4s)]
*  Thomas was both qualified for the position on the court, as were probably [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=370.76s)]
*  several dozen folks, maybe more. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=374.6s)]
*  He was also nominated due to the obvious political motivations in replacing the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=378.0s)]
*  nation's first black Justice Thurgood Marshall. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=382.96s)]
*  During his confirmation hearings, Thomas was asked about his own vocal opposition [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=386.2s)]
*  to affirmative action. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=390.36s)]
*  The question is directly in the entry to Yale. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=392.52s)]
*  Were you part of an affirmative action quota? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=396.12s)]
*  Were you part of a racial quota in terms of entering that law school? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=398.8s)]
*  Senator, I have not during my adult life or during my academic career been a part [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  of any quota. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  The effort on the part of Yale during my years there was to reach out and open its [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=411.24s)]
*  doors to minorities whom it felt were qualified. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  And I took them on at their word on that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=422.96s)]
*  And I have advocated that very kind of affirmative action. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=428.04s)]
*  Just think about that moment for a second, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=434.16s)]
*  Now, having seen some of this man's trajectory in his bio, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=435.72s)]
*  The thing he hates more than anything that wounds his pride, that enrages him, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=438.16s)]
*  is to be viewed as being less than or not qualified as being an affirmative action [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=442.24s)]
*  case. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=449.32s)]
*  And yet at every key juncture in his life, he's asked about it over and over again. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=449.56s)]
*  And for Thomas and the conservative majority in the court, it all boils down again to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=455.88s)]
*  this nebulous concept of merit, of qualified, who is deserving of opportunities and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=460.52s)]
*  who's not. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=466.04s)]
*  But I think that misses the point. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=467.92s)]
*  It's really a question about what kinds of institutions and really what kind of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=469.04s)]
*  society we want to have. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=472.28s)]
*  Do we want a society in which people like Clarence Thomas from the small town of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=474.28s)]
*  Pinpoint, Georgia, just several generations removed from slavery and Jim Crow, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=478.64s)]
*  are selected, nurtured and encouraged, or ones in which they don't go to Holy Cross [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=484.88s)]
*  and they don't go to Yale and they don't end up in the courts. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=489.88s)]
*  And instead, those schools and those institutions pick more sailing team members [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=491.84s)]
*  and legacies. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=495.32s)]
*  One of the things we saw today, and we saw a lot when we talked about it, was a [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=498.2s)]
*  brilliant man who was able to overcome centuries of institutionalized prejudice, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=501.08s)]
*  who was able to come from the most unlikely of backgrounds. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=505.0s)]
*  With the help of a system designed to accomplish just that, turn around and pull [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=510.96s)]
*  the ladder up behind. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=516.2s)]
*  Joy Reid is the host of The Readout right here on MSNBC, a graduate of Harvard [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=520.36s)]
*  University, the defendant in today's ruling. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=523.84s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=526.32s)]
*  Joy, let me first just get your reaction to the ruling, which I think we all [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=528.24s)]
*  suspected was coming. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  But given that it is your alma mater, I know you've been watching it closely. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=535.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=538.76s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=539.4s)]
*  What happened today? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=540.28s)]
*  And I will say I'm also very, very proud of Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, who I [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  was privileged to know at Harvard University, one of the most brilliant human [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=547.92s)]
*  beings I've ever met and had a chance to know. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  And her dissent, I thought, was scathing and perfect. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=554.76s)]
*  So, you know, I was not surprised because Clarence Thomas has been on a mission to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=558.4s)]
*  dismantle every institutional attempt to help and aid not just black people, but [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=564.04s)]
*  any people who have been disadvantaged in this society since he's gotten on the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=574.04s)]
*  court. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  He, like Samuel Alito, appears to operate from a kind of rage, a sort of cold rage [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  against the entire 20th century, the second half of the 20th century, which they [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=586.84s)]
*  find to be an affront to their own self-image and to their image of America as [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=593.56s)]
*  this country that is noble and that has always been noble and whose slave-holding [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  founders were noble and really hated slavery and were just so pained at the fact [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=605.24s)]
*  that they had to own all these people and that their wealth was derived from owning [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  these people. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=614.04s)]
*  But really, they were good-hearted. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=614.76s)]
*  And that's kind of what his concurrence discusses. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=616.0400000000001s)]
*  But what I find fascinating is what you put forward. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=618.76s)]
*  And I'm going to now have to watch that whole front line that you just showed a [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  piece of because let's just be clear. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=624.24s)]
*  Clarence Thomas was born in pinpoint Georgia. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=627.32s)]
*  He is a Begullah extraction. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=629.88s)]
*  He didn't even speak English until he was seven years old. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  He spoke the Geechee tongue and was so afraid to speak in front of white people [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=635.1600000000001s)]
*  because he was always told, don't speak Geechee in front of white people because [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  it would embarrass you, that he almost never spoke at all. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=644.04s)]
*  There was a nun, a white nun whose largesse helped get him through school and get [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=647.92s)]
*  him those good grades. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  He has been assisted by white patrons really his whole life, even now by very rich [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  ones as they fly him around the country. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=659.7199999999999s)]
*  And to your very point, he seems to deeply resent all of the assistance he got. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  And he wants to make sure that nobody like him ever gets that kind of help again [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=668.28s)]
*  because it helps his self image so that he can lie to himself and fool himself and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=673.4s)]
*  maybe hate himself a little less for having gotten help all along his path to the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=683.28s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=684.36s)]
*  The most important thing to know about his confirmation, other than the fact that [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=685.56s)]
*  he's accused credibly of sexual misconduct, is the polling that got him over the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  line. And it was the polling that I very much remember. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=696.16s)]
*  I was one of the few black folk who was against him. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=699.4s)]
*  It was the polling that showed that about seven in ten black people supported his [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=702.56s)]
*  ascension to the seat once held by the great Thurgood Marshall. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=708.7199999999999s)]
*  And he is not his equal. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=713.12s)]
*  It was black people's support that got wavering members of that Judiciary [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=714.4799999999999s)]
*  Committee and wavering senators. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=721.56s)]
*  They needed Democratic votes. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  There was a Democratic majority. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=724.76s)]
*  That's why Joe Biden is in those hearings running. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=726.04s)]
*  They needed the Democratic votes. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  And it was only black people's support in those polls that got wavering Democrats [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=730.1199999999999s)]
*  to vote for him. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  And he has repaid black people with scorn ever since. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  Let me let me ask you a follow up question about the pathos here, because, by the way, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  the front line that we play clips of and Slowburn, both about Clarence Thomas's [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=748.2399999999999s)]
*  trajectory, I cannot recognize them both highly enough. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=751.4s)]
*  They're just exquisite pieces of journalism. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=754.16s)]
*  And the story is fascinating. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=756.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's really one of the most interesting figures in American life. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=757.5200000000001s)]
*  I really believe this in terms of that trajectory. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=760.84s)]
*  I mean, there's a moment in Slowburn where Joel Anderson, who's the fantastic host and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=763.5600000000001s)]
*  the academic, Leah Wright-Ragour, who wrote a great book about black conservatives, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=767.5200000000001s)]
*  they're talking about their own experience in elite white dominated institutions. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=771.32s)]
*  Right. Of that kind of that feeling, that suspicion from white folks. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=775.24s)]
*  Oh, you're an affirmative action case. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, in Thomas's case, it's a defining anger of his life, but it's also real. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=782.8s)]
*  And I feel a little weird as a white person being like, you know, I don't want to, like, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=790.04s)]
*  say that what Thomas experienced was in any way not legitimate. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=793.64s)]
*  Like, I think he comes by it, honestly. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=796.96s)]
*  But I'm curious how you think about it and you think about that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=798.92s)]
*  That sort of coded racism that comes in those in those institutions and circumstances [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=803.52s)]
*  and what it means for the broader question of whether we should have it constitutionally. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=808.92s)]
*  Well, let me just be clear. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=812.84s)]
*  I got into Harvard only because of affirmative action. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=814.08s)]
*  I went to a school no one had ever heard of in Denver, Colorado, in a small suburb. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=817.08s)]
*  I didn't go to Exeter or Andover. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=821.08s)]
*  I didn't have college test prep. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=822.88s)]
*  I just happened to be really nerdy and smart and have really good grades and good SAT [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=824.4s)]
*  scores. But someone came to Denver, Colorado to look for me. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=827.6s)]
*  A Harvard recruiter flew to Denver and I met up with her at the Village Inn [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=831.68s)]
*  restaurant and did a pre-interview to get to to pull me into Harvard. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=836.8s)]
*  I wasn't I was pulled in and in the schools like Harvard and Yale that I got into. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  Affirmatively. Yes. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=845.84s)]
*  And it was literally not saying we're going to take an unqualified person and put them in [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=846.84s)]
*  Harvard. We're going to take a very qualified person who we would never know existed [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  and put them in Harvard. That's how I got there. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=855.8s)]
*  That's how Katanji got there. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=857.72s)]
*  That's how Justice Jackson, I should say, Justice Jackson got there. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  It's how Clarence Thomas got there. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  But the minute I arrived from my majority black little town, Montbello in Denver, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=864.24s)]
*  to Harvard, the first like week or two that I was in class, my presence was questioned [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  by white people. I was in this big conference class where some white students stood up [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  and said, those students, the black students, they're only here because of affirmative [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=879.76s)]
*  action. It became a huge argument that we all ended up having. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=883.4799999999999s)]
*  This was freshman year. I had never had my academic credentials questioned. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=886.16s)]
*  I had never had anyone question whether I was intelligent until I got to Harvard. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=890.04s)]
*  And it was a defining point of my experience there. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=893.8s)]
*  It's why I really was one of the many reasons I was miserable there. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=896.8399999999999s)]
*  My freshman year, you feel completely out of place and people keep telling you, you [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  shouldn't be here. And yet some of the people I went to school with were far less smart [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=903.6s)]
*  than me or the other black folk there. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=909.52s)]
*  They got in because their daddy and their granddaddy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=911.32s)]
*  I went to school with somebody whose name was on one of the buildings. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=913.6s)]
*  You're going to school with people whose names are on the buildings, who are third and [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=917.72s)]
*  fourth generation legacies, whose parents pumped money into Harvard to get them in. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=921.88s)]
*  But that affirmative action is OK with this majority. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  They said that the people who benefited from slavery, their descendants who are so far [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=930.52s)]
*  ahead of black folk in terms of opportunity, that will never catch up to them. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=935.36s)]
*  I don't care how many Oprah's we get. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  Those people's affirmative action is a OK because those people can pay for fancy trips [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=941.08s)]
*  for them. But you people who want to get in just because of your brains, but you're not [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=947.32s)]
*  from a legacy, too bad you can't come in. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=952.28s)]
*  We're out of time, but I would commend people to read the JFK admissions essay, which is [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=955.8399999999999s)]
*  a truly hilarious document in which JFK says why he wants to go to Harvard. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=960.4s)]
*  The reasons I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=963.7199999999999s)]
*  I feel at Harvard could give me a better background, a better liberal education than any [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=965.8s)]
*  other university goes on like that point being, though, this has been a finishing school [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=968.52s)]
*  for the elite for a very long time. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=972.16s)]
*  Joy, that was thank you so much. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=973.36s)]
*  I know I kept you long at work tonight, but I truly and genuinely appreciate you coming [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=975.5999999999999s)]
*  on. That's fantastic. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=979.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbiPRfbAEMw&t=985.04s)]
