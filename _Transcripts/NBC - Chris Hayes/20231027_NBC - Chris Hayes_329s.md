# Israel-Hamas war Ex-hostage negotiator explains ‘most dangerous part’ of process
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak)
*  Scott Walker is a former hostage negotiator, as well as former counterterrorism advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=0.0s)]
*  to the United Nations, and he joins me now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=5.2s)]
*  Scott, I was watching the sort of plaintiff and agonizing entreaties by the families of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=8.16s)]
*  the hostages today in Washington. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=15.44s)]
*  And, of course, they've held numerous events in Israel as well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=17.6s)]
*  There was this kind of pinprick of hope, I think, that's come from the fact that four [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  hostages have been released, a dual-citizen American Israeli mother and daughter, and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  then two women, Israeli women. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=30.72s)]
*  Can you give some context for what is happening right now, to the best of your knowledge, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=34.08s)]
*  the best as you can draw from your experience, in terms of those negotiations? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  I think what we've seen so far demonstrates that the process that is in place is working. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=45.64s)]
*  We've seen four hostages come out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=52.0s)]
*  I appreciate there's over 200 being held, but it does show you that those negotiations [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=54.04s)]
*  are working and that the lines of communication, the trust that's being built between the Qataris [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=59.8s)]
*  in this case and the Palestinian and then the Hamas leadership to secure the release [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=65.8s)]
*  of those hostages so far. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=70.8s)]
*  But we're far from over with this, and there'll be lots of coordination, lots of communication [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=72.48s)]
*  going back and forth between Israel, Qatar, and Hamas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=78.0s)]
*  Obviously, taking hostages, the acts of Hamas in southern Israel were a war crime, and taking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  hostages is a violation of international law. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=87.6s)]
*  The international law would compel an immediate and unconditional release of those hostages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=91.2s)]
*  They're not going to do that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=96.6s)]
*  Obviously, they have some value in negotiations. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=97.6s)]
*  Do you think there's an interplay between calculations about ground incursions or escalations [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=101.0s)]
*  there and the hostage negotiations? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you think those are on parallel tracks, or are they connected? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=108.48s)]
*  It's very difficult to say, but I think it is fair to say that Hamas will be in no hurry [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=113.08s)]
*  to release that many hostages right now because they serve a purpose for them in terms of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=120.0s)]
*  being a human shield and for bargaining, et cetera. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=125.6s)]
*  It's also fair to say that any increase in military activity is potentially going to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=130.8s)]
*  increase the risk to the hostages, not just whilst they're being held captive, but actually [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=135.8s)]
*  the most dangerous part of a negotiation is the release and recovery phase where you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=141.0s)]
*  logistically, physically, you have to transport the hostages to safety. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=147.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=151.6s)]
*  And in terms of the details of this, I mean, you have the Israeli spokesperson for Prime [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=152.6s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comparing Hamas to ISIS and the Nazis, that they seek their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=159.84s)]
*  total destruction, that they will rid the world of Hamas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=164.72s)]
*  At the same time, there's some kind of back channel through an intermediary with Hamas [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=167.68s)]
*  to try to get the hostages back. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  Is there a cutout such that no one's ever talking to each other face to face and there's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  a go-between? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=179.4s)]
*  Qatari diplomats or some people like that that end up being the folks that are faring [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=180.88s)]
*  messages back and forth? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=185.36s)]
*  Well, how it's done on the ground just depends on the facilities and the ability they've [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  got to have those communications, whether or not it's in person. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  We know that Hamas leadership is in Doha, the capital of Qatar, and so those conversations [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  will be taking place whether or not they're over the phone or in person. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=203.76s)]
*  You said at the beginning of this something that I think surprised me a little bit, which [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=209.16s)]
*  is that the release of four hostages to you, based on your experience, showed that there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=212.36s)]
*  was some progress being made. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=217.36s)]
*  Do you think that process can continue? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=220.4s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope so, and there's no reason why it shouldn't. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=224.28s)]
*  It just depends on how far they can get with the negotiations. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=229.2s)]
*  Just because you're negotiating with somebody, with the hostage takers, it doesn't necessarily [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=233.0s)]
*  automatically mean that an agreement is going to be reached and hostage is going to be released. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=237.44s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=241.84s)]
*  There's so much going on in the background and in this context that makes it probably [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=242.84s)]
*  the most challenging kind of hostage situation you could ever come across. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=248.44s)]
*  What are the kinds of demands of alternate prisoner releases or things of that nature [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=252.64s)]
*  that happen when you talk about a negotiation, a back and forth, just generally speaking? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=262.44s)]
*  It depends on the circumstances and who the hostage takers are, but in this case, the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=268.56s)]
*  verit that it could be a bargaining tool, it could be to try and slow down any kind [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=273.4s)]
*  of ground incursion, prisoner exchange, and also from Hamas's perspective, to demonstrate [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=280.2s)]
*  that they're still relevant in the world. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=286.72s)]
*  We saw before October the 7th that Israel were about to sign a deal with Saudi, for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=289.32s)]
*  example, and actually seemed like the region was gradually moving on. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=294.56s)]
*  And so this is another opportunity for Hamas to demonstrate to the world that they're still relevant. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Alright, Scott Walker, thank you very much for sharing your expertise. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=305.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL7ktP3dak&t=309.92s)]
