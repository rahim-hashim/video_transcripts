# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 21
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA)
*  Good evening from Washington. I'm Jen Psaki and for Chris Hayes and just two days on Wednesday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican candidates will meet on a stage in Milwaukee for the first Republican primary [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=6.96s)]
*  debate this cycle. It's also the week that the Republican front runner who announced [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  he's skipping the debate is required to surrender to authorities in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=15.48s)]
*  If that combination of things doesn't perfectly capture the state of the Republican Party [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=20.92s)]
*  right now, I don't really know what does. And today Donald Trump's lawyers met with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=24.96s)]
*  Fulton County prosecutors to discuss his surrender over the 13 felony count indictment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=29.16s)]
*  brought by District Attorney Fonny Willis, where prosecutors say he orchestrated a criminal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=33.72s)]
*  enterprise to steal the 2020 election in Georgia. After roughly an hour discussing the terms, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=38.64s)]
*  the attorney, the attorneys, along with funny, well, it's came to an agreement over the ex [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=45.0s)]
*  president's bonds and Atlanta judge set the bond for Trump at $200,000. The order also includes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=48.84s)]
*  some striking language, which stuck out to me and a stark warning for the ex president. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=56.12s)]
*  It says, quote, the defendant, Donald J. Trump, shall perform no act to intimidate any person [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  known to him or her to be a co-defendant or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=67.56s)]
*  the administration of justice. Wonder why that was all needed in there. The agreement [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=73.28s)]
*  orders him to not make any threats against any witnesses or co-defendants, including threats [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=78.12s)]
*  made on social media. And the ex president is ordered not to discuss the case with his 18 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=82.88s)]
*  co-defendants. One of those defendants, Trump attorney and fake electors schemer, Kenneth [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=88.6s)]
*  Cheesebrough, had his bond package set at $100,000 today after his attorneys were spotted meeting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  with prosecutors at the courthouse. Meanwhile, co-defendant and fake electors, cum-emo author [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=100.44s)]
*  John Eastman also had his bond set at $100,000. All 19 defendants, Trump included, including him, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=105.6s)]
*  of course, have until Friday to surrender. And all of this is happening as the majority of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=113.16s)]
*  Republican candidates seem to be on a whole nother planet, pretending like this isn't actually [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  the weirdest and the most unprecedented debate week in history. Just look at the last few days. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=124.72s)]
*  A few of the candidates seem to be having a hell of a time at the Iowa State Fair this weekend. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  Good for them. Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson seemed to enjoy cooking up some [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=135.12s)]
*  burgers while former Texas Congressman Will Hurd took a selfie with a supporter. And every major [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=139.28s)]
*  Republican candidate, except the one who has just been indicted, participated in a forward-looking, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  policy-driven forum in Georgia. That all sounds refreshingly normal-ish, right? I mean, it's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  normal. Maybe we're back to normal. Except here's the problem, the big problem. Things are not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=156.9s)]
*  normal. The most important photo for history books this week, when we all look back, will not be of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  Republican candidates cooking up burgers or standing on stage debating energy and tax policy on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Wednesday. It will be the mugshot of the ex-president of the United States from when he surrenders for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  the fourth time in just over four months on charges that he orchestrated a criminal conspiracy to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  steal the 2020 election in Georgia. On Wednesday, the day of the debate, Trump plans to release a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=186.28s)]
*  prerecorded video on social media with the TV guy formerly employed by Fox. And the next day, he may [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=193.12s)]
*  reportedly turn himself in. Here's the crazy thing, as if all of that isn't crazy enough. Despite the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=199.8s)]
*  indictments thing, the jail thing, and even the mugshot thing, Donald Trump is still absolutely [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=206.28s)]
*  crushing everyone in the Republican field by double digits. Coming up, we will talk to Steve [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=212.32s)]
*  Kornacki and Iowa pollster Ann Seltzer to discuss a striking new poll from NBC News and the Des Moines [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=217.84s)]
*  Register that shows Trump leading DeSantis by over 20 points. And some interesting data underneath [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=224.04s)]
*  there as well. And most candidates do not know exactly what to do with these numbers because they [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=230.64s)]
*  haven't moved that much in a while. So they keep talking about looking forward and not looking back [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=234.84s)]
*  instead of attacking Trump head on. I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=241.24s)]
*  focused on what happened four years ago in January. And so I want to focus on looking forward. I don't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=248.28s)]
*  want to look back. We have to move forward. We've got to quit living in the past. I look forward to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=255.16s)]
*  having a conversation and frankly, even a debate about the future of this nation. I think we need [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=259.36s)]
*  to move forward as a country. We've got to be looking to the future, not to the past. But the problem [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=263.8s)]
*  is that all of this talk about looking forward, which by the way is very normal campaign speak, only ignores [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=270.0s)]
*  the big political elephant in the room, Donald Trump. Or maybe he's not in the room. Let's talk about the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=276.72s)]
*  debate on Wednesday. It is based on this argument they all seem to be making that the Trump [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=281.24s)]
*  indictments have nothing to do with the policy issues presidents deal with. That's just a distraction [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=286.24s)]
*  over here. There is this cop out argument that you can either be talking about Trump, his legal issues [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=291.72s)]
*  in the past or policy and the future. There are a few more fundamental policy positions for presidents [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=297.48s)]
*  than how you view democracy and national security of the country you want to lead, including their [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  national security secrets. So let's start with the federal indictment around Trump's mishandling of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=309.32s)]
*  classified documents and obstruction of justice. Holding on to classified documents, including [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=313.88s)]
*  nuclear plans, waving Iran war plans around with a disregard for the impact on national security and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  the people serving you around the world is a policy position. Then there's the other federal [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=326.4s)]
*  indictment brought by special counsel Jack Smith for Trump's attempted scheme to steal the 2020 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  election. Believing your victory, your win is more important than the will of the public is a policy [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=337.52s)]
*  position as a sidebar one that dictators take. Attempting to bend the justice system to benefit you is a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=344.52s)]
*  policy position. You don't see the role of an independent judiciary. That's a pretty important position to have. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=351.28s)]
*  So have a conversation about policy issues that we can all embrace that. But don't leave the core ones of the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=357.44s)]
*  future of our democracy, the protection of our national security secrets out of the conversation, because [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  silence on those should be taken as complacent agreement with the policies of the current and overwhelming [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=368.44s)]
*  Republican primary front runner. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=374.72s)]
*  So this is surrender week for Donald Trump, as well as the 18 others charged with racketeering in Georgia for plotting to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=378.44s)]
*  steal the 2020 election. They'll have just over three and a half days until noon on Friday to surrender at the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=384.96s)]
*  Fulton County Jail to avoid facing arrest. We just learned that the ex president says he will surrender in Atlanta on [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=391.16s)]
*  Thursday. Today, his lawyers were at the Fulton County Courthouse where his bond was set at $200,000. Let's just sit with [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=397.08s)]
*  that for a second. By the end of this week, the ex president of the United States will be out on bond in yet another [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=403.64s)]
*  jurisdiction. Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis is also trying to stop Trump from continuing his practice of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=409.76s)]
*  making direct or indirect threats or both against people involved in his various criminal cases. She ordered him to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=415.08s)]
*  quote, perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or her to be a co-defendant or witness in this case or to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=422.08s)]
*  otherwise obstruct the administration of justice. That includes no threat of any nature against any co-defendant, against [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=428.8s)]
*  any witness, against any victim or against the community. And it makes clear that this applies to quote posts on social [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=436.12s)]
*  media or reposts of posts or retweets, if you want to call them that, made by another individual. Some of Trump's 18 [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=442.56s)]
*  co-defendants also got bond orders today as well, but Trump is so far the only one with these detailed orders against making [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=449.8s)]
*  threats. I wonder why. All of this comes while the ex president and his legal team are navigating three other indictments and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=455.6s)]
*  the possibility that some of his co-defendants in Georgia may have a big incentive, a huge incentive to cooperate against him. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=462.8s)]
*  For one thing, Trump can never pardon any of them, even if he returns to the White House, because this is a state case. And of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  course, all of this is just a fraction of his current legal problems. Glenn Kirchner is a former federal prosecutor and host of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=475.36s)]
*  the podcast, Justice Matters. Ankush Cardori is a former federal prosecutor and a contributing writer for New York magazine. And both join me [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=481.8s)]
*  now. So Glenn, I just wanted to start with these kind of warnings from the judge, because that is very strong language. We've heard in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=489.12s)]
*  some of these other cases. But what can she actually do? And what do you think she should do if he violates it? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=495.8s)]
*  You know, I don't think Fonny Willis owns a pair of kid gloves. So I have a feeling if Donald Trump violates these conditions, and how [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=501.52s)]
*  could he not, Jen, right? He can't post or repost anything that might be intimidating of a witness. Not just a week ago, he did [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=510.52s)]
*  something that if he did it now, it would be prohibited by this this order. He said, Look, I know that former Lieutenant Governor Jeff [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=519.72s)]
*  Duncan is about to testify before the grand jury, quote, he shouldn't. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=528.8s)]
*  He's already violated it, essentially. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=533.68s)]
*  He would have. And interestingly, that actually constitutes a violation of Georgia state law. And that could be used next week by Judge [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=535.52s)]
*  Chutkin up the street to say you did violate a condition that had been set for you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=545.4s)]
*  Which is just coming up next Monday. And we were just talking before we, during the break, I guess, about what the actual conditions are, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=549.24s)]
*  what are the consequences if your name is not Donald Trump, which is important to remember as we discuss equal justice under law. So if [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=555.52s)]
*  somebody else did this, what would happen to them? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=561.36s)]
*  Well, actually, we have a pretty good example that has been in the news recently. Sam Bankman Fried was charged for a massive fraud. He [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=563.88s)]
*  was out on bail. And prosecutors allege and the judge agreed that it appeared that he was attempting witness intimidation by kind of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=570.6800000000001s)]
*  working through the press to seed some negative information about a cooperator. He was remanded. That means he was sent to jail. And, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=578.2s)]
*  you know, the judge was not happy about it, obviously. But that's what often happens to defendants who are out on bond. Honestly, in [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=585.28s)]
*  the ordinary course, it can be quite easy to violate terms of release, almost like a tripwire. And Trump is sort of getting sort of a lot of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=591.64s)]
*  benefit of the doubt. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=602.52s)]
*  You also had something you wrote interestingly recently that the addition of defendants creates pressure and incentives for those people to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=603.84s)]
*  cooperate against the biggest target, which in this case is clearly Trump. I referenced, of course, in Georgia, he can't pardon them. What [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=610.32s)]
*  are the other incentives? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's the traditional set of incentives. And this applies at the federal and the state level. Anytime you have a large [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=619.36s)]
*  multi-defendant case and there's a lead defendant, right, and Trump is undoubtedly the lead defendant here, right, there is an incentive for [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=624.84s)]
*  everyone else who might have information on him to try to cooperate against that person to get, cut themselves a break at the end of the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=631.12s)]
*  day. It's purely self-interest. It's not an act of altruism, right? They've been charged. And if they need to be sentenced one day after a [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=637.0s)]
*  conviction, they're going to want all of the credit and goodwill that they can generate with prosecutors. So that tends to be the normal [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=644.0s)]
*  calculus. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=649.76s)]
*  So, Glenn, there's been a whole back and forth about the timeline here. That's a very diplomatic way of saying this, given Trump's team has [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=650.6s)]
*  asked for a trial in 2026. Jack Smith's team replied and said that's bogus. That date is going to be set or we expect that date to be set [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=656.68s)]
*  coming up next Monday. What do you think is going to happen here? What's kind of a viable timeline for a trial? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=667.16s)]
*  Well, let's look at what Judge Chutkin said previously. She said, you know, if the defendant continues to say things, to post things that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  might interfere with our ability to pick a fair and impartial jury, might poison the jury pool, might intimidate witnesses, I will accelerate the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  trial date. He has done some of those things. So I have a feeling Judge Chutkin is going to set a trial date in early 2024. I also think when the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=691.76s)]
*  defense team, Trump's defense team, throws out a date that's two and a half to three years down the road, April 2026, it sort of shows that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=700.7199999999999s)]
*  they're not really engaged in legitimate lawyering. I mean, it really feels like they're assistant campaign chairman at this point for Donald Trump. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  It feels so ludicrous a little bit. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=717.7199999999999s)]
*  And that will help, I think, push Judge Chutkin to an earlier trial date if they're not really trying to legitimately present a trial date that, you [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=718.8399999999999s)]
*  know, is an honest assessment of how much time they think they're going to need. So I can't wait until next Monday. I want to see what Judge Chutkin does. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=727.92s)]
*  But I think she understands that everybody, including the American people, have a keen interest in getting this case resolved well in advance of the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=734.48s)]
*  2024 election. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=743.0s)]
*  Do you agree on the timeline early next year? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=744.56s)]
*  I do agree if it's feasible. I mean, I think out of all of these cases, I think the strongest imperative by far concerns the January 6th [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=746.72s)]
*  federal January 6 case and bringing that case to trial ideally as quickly as possible. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=754.28s)]
*  I also agree that, you know, the setting of a trial date, anytime you have kind of litigation and competing positions of parties can be a bit like settlement [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=758.52s)]
*  or like a bid and ask sort of scenario, right? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=765.32s)]
*  Prosecutors have put forward a date. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=767.88s)]
*  Trump's lawyers have put forward a date that's so absurd that I think Chutkin will just set it aside, or it's very probable she'll set it aside. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=769.64s)]
*  And that really sort of the main kind of center of gravity is going to be the prosecutor's proposal. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=775.76s)]
*  I have no idea how it will be resolved, but she does seem to have a keen awareness of the significance of this case and its importance to the country. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=779.92s)]
*  Before I let you go on my legal education this evening, I wanted to ask you about Mark Meadows because there's a range of reporting about him [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=787.5999999999999s)]
*  cooperating, not cooperating, sharing information, not. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  We don't entirely know the totality of it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=798.12s)]
*  But for each of you, and I'm going to start with you, Glenn, what's the best case scenario for Mark Meadows? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=800.4s)]
*  You know, he's in such a curious posture right now. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=805.28s)]
*  This is like an action adventure legal thriller because all indicators were that he was cooperating with Jack Smith in the federal case, both in Washington [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=808.1999999999999s)]
*  and in the documents case in Florida. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=818.56s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he pops up as a charged Rico defendant in Georgia. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=821.12s)]
*  Now, I will say when I had defendants and they had criminal exposure in multiple jurisdictions, I worked very hard to try to to try to strike a global plea agreement [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=826.48s)]
*  that would resolve all of their criminal exposure so we could kind of keep our cooperator close. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=837.08s)]
*  That doesn't seem to be the case right now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=843.5200000000001s)]
*  So it feels like maybe he is helping Jack Smith. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=845.08s)]
*  Maybe he has not yet formalized a cooperation agreement. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=848.64s)]
*  And Jack Smith has said until that happens, you just go ahead and take care of your own little problems down in Georgia. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=852.4000000000001s)]
*  And maybe we'll circle back on that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=858.64s)]
*  And Seltzer is the president of Seltzer and Company, a polling firm based in Des Moines, Iowa, that she founded in 1996 and whose polling is considered the gold standard in the much important early [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=861.28s)]
*  nominating states. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=872.1999999999999s)]
*  I know from having done many Iowa caucuses myself and it is her firm that just conducted the first twenty twenty four NBC News Des Moines Register poll and she joins me now. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=872.88s)]
*  So, Anne, Steve just went through a lot of it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  What stands out to you in this poll? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=885.24s)]
*  Well, I think that what's interesting about caucus polling is very difficult to do for one thing. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=887.12s)]
*  And the reason it is is because it's a fluctuating pool of people from cycle to cycle. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=893.12s)]
*  And I think it's easy to talk about. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=899.64s)]
*  Well, it's a set group of people and Donald Trump has this slice and maybe that's a ceiling, but maybe that's his floor. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=903.16s)]
*  And the perhaps a way to think about it differently is you can make a bigger pie. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=912.08s)]
*  And one of the pieces of data in this poll shows that among independents, Trump's lead is only two percentage points. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=919.4s)]
*  Now, there are only one out of four of the people who qualified as a likely Republican caucus goer. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=926.92s)]
*  But what we have seen in the past is where the ground game of people talk about Iowa and the importance of retail politics and the importance of the ground game. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=932.96s)]
*  But that's because you can go start knocking on doors and get people committed to your lesser ranked candidate and have them show up in sufficient numbers that they change the complexion of the caucus altogether. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=941.4s)]
*  So one of those down ballot candidates might decide, look, if I can go and identify 40,000 people who will agree to caucus for me, it can turn things upside down for Donald Trump. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=954.4s)]
*  That would be quite a story. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=967.2s)]
*  So with that in mind, and you've been doing this for 27 years, what did you see in the poll as kind of a sign of positive momentum for another candidate not named Donald Trump? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=969.0s)]
*  Well, I think that Steve Kornacki spoke to it, which is there's goodwill towards some of these other candidates. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=981.76s)]
*  There's some ill will toward a couple of them, Mike Pence and Chris Christie, for example. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=988.2s)]
*  But the will wasn't all that favorable to them when they ran for this in 2016. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  So that that sort of is their track record here in Iowa. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=998.2s)]
*  But I think that goodwill is a piece of it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1001.6s)]
*  And then I think it really has to do with how they how the candidates are going about recruiting first time caucus goers, which aren't a terribly large portion, according to our poll just yet. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1004.24s)]
*  They were a bigger deal back in 2016. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1018.2s)]
*  I think that's there. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1021.08s)]
*  I think the independent vote is there. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1022.36s)]
*  I think identifying the people who are kind of done with Trump and figuring out how to build, how to position yourself if you're the candidate in such a way that it is not off putting, but in fact would bring more people out. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1024.44s)]
*  And so very hard to pull caucus goers. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1043.72s)]
*  You are very, very good at it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1046.1200000000001s)]
*  The gold standard. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me this evening. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcX0ck8buA&t=1048.96s)]
