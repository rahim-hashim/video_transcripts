# Hayes: CNN town hall showed how not to cover Trump ahead of 2024
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk)
*  As far as I can tell, there were two reasons CNN did that town hall last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=0.0s)]
*  One is that CNN came under new ownership last year with the Warner Brothers Discovery merger. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=3.44s)]
*  And that ushered in a new leader with David Zaslav running the operation, particularly with a key [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=8.24s)]
*  shareholder who has Zaslav's ear. That's John Malone. You see him there next to Zaslav. Now, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=12.96s)]
*  Malone is a member of Warner Brothers Discovery boards and he's a conservative guy. He's a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=17.92s)]
*  conservative billionaire Republican donor who donated $250,000 to Donald Trump's inaugural. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And if you read interviews with Malone and track both public statements from Zaslav and reporting, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=28.64s)]
*  it's quite clear the new ownership has an explicit ideological project. They come out and say it. To [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=34.16s)]
*  make the network more Trump and Republican friendly. And that ideological project is so strong [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=40.32s)]
*  that they will do that even if, you know, that costs them viewers and revenue, which it seems [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=45.92s)]
*  to have been doing recently. Which brings us to their second reason for this town hall. And [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=50.32s)]
*  believe me, I work in this business. I understand ratings. It is not a novel observation to say that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=56.0s)]
*  there is a car crash quality to Donald Trump. I saw it on social media last night. People [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=61.68s)]
*  hate watching. He compels attention in spite of ourselves. But here's the thing. Even that is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=66.24s)]
*  fading quite a bit. Last night, 3 million people watched this event. Now that's a lot of people, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=73.12s)]
*  but that's not a crazy number. It is nothing like Trump would draw in 2016. I mean, Tucker Carlson [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=79.12s)]
*  used to get on that a typical Tuesday night before he got fired. What is galling about the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=84.56s)]
*  decision to do this Trump town hall to me is the disingenuousness about the decision to do it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=89.68s)]
*  Today, CNN chairman Chris Licht wants you to believe that was journalism that did that last [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  night. We made a lot of news, he says, and then quote, America was served very well by what we [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=100.72s)]
*  did last night. To state the obvious fact here, that wasn't journalism. It's hard to imagine [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=105.68s)]
*  America was well served by hosting a nationally televised insurrection rally. But the other thing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=112.08s)]
*  is there are ways to cover Donald Trump. In fact, there are ways to interview him, which I certainly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=116.48s)]
*  wouldn't object to, that don't involve a live platform with hundreds of his whooping, cheering [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=120.56s)]
*  super fans ritualistically humiliating your host and network. Michelle Goldberg is an op-ed columnist [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=126.64s)]
*  for the New York Times, and she joins me now. What do you think? I mean, it was appalling. And, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=135.68s)]
*  I think everybody thought it was going to be bad and it was so much worse. And I think it's the odd [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=141.36s)]
*  what you zeroed in on. The thing that made it particularly appalling was that you had this pro [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=146.16s)]
*  Trump crowd and there was no need to do that. I think that, look, for better or worse, or not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=151.44s)]
*  just for better or worse, for worse, Donald Trump is the front runner for the Republican nomination. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  He is a newsworthy figure. I think it's worth interviewing him on the day after he was found [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=161.12s)]
*  liable for sexual abuse and defamation to find out what he has to say about that. But you don't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=166.56s)]
*  need to do it in a kind of Trump rally format. And the other thing that's so weird about that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=172.16s)]
*  statement is that it's actually not journalism to make news. It's journalism to cover news, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=177.44s)]
*  right? Not to kind of set up an event in which there's going to be kind of a lot of outreach [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=183.6s)]
*  reaction and then you can boast about driving the conversation. I mean, the other thing I'll say is, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  and this I think relates to the ratings a little bit and people will say, well, people aren't [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  paying close attention. But, you know, I saw people say that part of the news was you say, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  he refused to commit on pardoning the Jan Sixers. Like, he said this, he's been saying this all over [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=204.32s)]
*  the place. There was nothing new. He doesn't say anything new. He says the same thing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. But I actually think there's a sort of a mix, there's like a mixed thing there in that the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=214.88s)]
*  fact that he's saying this stuff, but he's not saying it on CNN and he's not saying it outside [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  of the kind of right wing ecosystem means that a lot of people have been able to put it to the side [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  to forget about it. And I think there is value in everybody being reminded of it, but you don't need [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  to do it on such explicitly pro-Trump turf. Yes. And I think this is actually where I think you and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  I agree that there is some real thorniness here about what to do about this sort of attention [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  black hole. And we've all sort of wrestled with it over eight years. There's a certain school of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=244.4s)]
*  thought it shows up in my inbox and in my Twitter feed of like, don't play him at all. Don't cover [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=248.72s)]
*  him. It's the coverage that gives him power itself. And I don't agree with that. Like he's powerful [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=253.04s)]
*  because he says things like Republicans, the Republican base likes, which is where his power [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=258.16s)]
*  comes from. So I think that like there's an overcorrection the other direction. You even [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=263.04s)]
*  said that the other day, I thought it was interesting with the E. Jean Carroll thing, which is like, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=268.16s)]
*  the ex president is being civilly tried for sexual abuse. Like it feels like it should be a bigger [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=272.24s)]
*  story. Yeah, no, I mean, it was so shocking to me, you know, when I was in the courthouse, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=277.76s)]
*  just that it wasn't that hard to get into the courthouse, right? You know, there were, at one [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  point I thought I was late. So I went to the media overflow room, but there was nobody there [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=286.48s)]
*  because there was just still plenty of seats left. And yeah, I mean, and I think part of that is that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=290.88s)]
*  people, you know, didn't want, they thought they, they thought they knew everything that there was [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=296.56s)]
*  to know about that story, right? The stories that we heard at that trial are mostly stories that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  we've heard before. But again, I think that there's, there's some real nuance here because [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=305.36s)]
*  I think Trump did lose some of his power. Certainly it's kind of agenda setting power when he lost his [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=309.92s)]
*  Twitter account, when he lost his reach on social media. It does matter, but it's not the totality [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=315.2s)]
*  of where he gets his political power from. This is the quote, the sort of, this is Chris Licht, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  you don't have to like the former president's answers. We can't say we didn't get them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  Caitlin Pressom again and again made news, made a lot of news, and that is our job. Again, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=332.8s)]
*  I, you know, people can tell themselves whatever they need to get up in the morning. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=336.56s)]
*  But it's also, I mean, it does, here's the thing. I do wonder what, how are you going to deal with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=341.68s)]
*  him as the nominee a second time if you were a mainstream news outlet? And it really is an [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  existential question because like, it's like the Wall Street Journal isn't going to cover both [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=354.96s)]
*  sides of the question of whether their journalists currently imprisoned in Russia should be in prison. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  Right, right. They have a very clear position, the correct one, which is that he's a hostage to the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Russian state. And it's like Donald Trump running for reelection to me is almost that clear for a [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=371.12s)]
*  press outlet. And yeah, and I think that what you see coming from, you know, the sort of justification [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  where we have to hear both sides, there is a kind of brain dead rich guy centrism that is, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=382.8s)]
*  that thinks that it is the sort of middle path between two ideologies, but is really an ideology [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=388.8s)]
*  in and of itself. And so that kind of, yeah, it's sort of like, oh, we have, you know, it kind of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  almost absolves them from having to make moral decisions about what to cover as if the news was [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=399.92s)]
*  some sort of naturally occurring thing. And at the same time, if you're a political reporter, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=404.64s)]
*  you work at the New York Times, a newspaper I dearly love, an institution I dearly love, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=408.64s)]
*  or the Washington Post, or a million other places, you know, you can't write, you know, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=413.44s)]
*  you're not going to, every article isn't going to be a Chris Hayes opening monologue about how [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  democracy is like. You got to write, you know. Well, let me say this, like you would cover, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=421.76s)]
*  obviously, what does Donald Trump say about Eugene Carroll? I don't think that you would [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=424.8s)]
*  print all of his defamatory insults verbatim. Right, yeah. Right, you don't kind of give him [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=428.64s)]
*  a platform in that way. Right. And I think making those decisions is exactly the sort of, that's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=433.44s)]
*  where it gets like the minute decisions of what we, you know, even today, like what do we show [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=436.96s)]
*  and what don't we? Those, you're going to have to be making those decisions all the time. Right, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  and what's frustrating, I feel like, is that they've sort of, they've said it's not their [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  responsibility to make those decisions at all. Right, but making those decisions is what our job [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=448.88s)]
*  is. That's our job. Michelle Goldberg, always a pleasure. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=453.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqD1gNG7wJk&t=466.96s)]
