# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Nov. 16
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes one of the most distressing elements of these anguishing past 41 days since the horrific events of October 7th and the start of the brutal and bloody war between Israel and Hamas is the marked rise in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=0.0s)]
*  Anti-semitic incidents around the world and right here in the US the anti-defamation League's Center on Extremism documented [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=14.0s)]
*  832 anti-semitic incidents of assault vandalism and harassment in the US in just four weeks following the attack [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=21.84s)]
*  It comes out to an average of nearly 28 incidents per day and represents a 316% increase over the same period last year [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=27.9s)]
*  You could just see it, I mean, in any city you live. Just here in New York City, anti-semitic hate crimes surged 214% in the month of October [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=35.9s)]
*  Across the country we've seen synagogues and Jewish schools, Jewish centers, even a Jewish cemetery defaced, vandalized [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=45.9s)]
*  People have torn down flyers bringing attention to the more than 220 hostages kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=54.8s)]
*  A lot of these incidents have taken place under cover of night or behind the relative anonymity of a screen [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=62.8s)]
*  But yesterday the wealthiest man in the world made one of the most shocking public pronouncements of anti-semitism I've seen [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=69.8s)]
*  And he did it on the platform that he owns. I'm speaking of course of Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=77.7s)]
*  Who purchased Twitter last year, changed his name, and promptly managed to lose $25 billion on it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=84.7s)]
*  Musk brought his hard-right views to the platform where he elevated the most loathsome offensive bigots [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=92.7s)]
*  He welcomed back outright nevada neo-nazis who'd been banned from the website [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=99.7s)]
*  He's defended white supremacists, complained about racism against white people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=104.6s)]
*  He compared Jewish billionaire George Soros to a Jewish Marvel supervillain [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=109.6s)]
*  With Elon Musk's attention and encouragement, those with the most despicable views have essentially taken over the platform now known as X [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=114.6s)]
*  This is a man with enormous power and influence well beyond the internet [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=124.6s)]
*  He's one of the most powerful private citizens in the world [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=128.6s)]
*  Just yesterday, Musk attended a cocktail hour with Chinese President Xi Jinping that followed the bilateral meeting with President Joe Biden [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=131.5s)]
*  Musk also has the ear of top US officials who welcome him like royalty anytime he descends on Washington [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=139.5s)]
*  And so it's this man who took to his website yesterday to endorse the most violent, dangerous anti-semitic conspiracy theory [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=146.5s)]
*  Now it all began with a person who describes himself as a Jewish conservative expressing his anger about that recent rise of anti-semitism [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=154.4s)]
*  He addresses the quote, cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting Hitler was right [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=161.4s)]
*  And calls for them to step out of the shadows and quote, say it to our faces [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=167.4s)]
*  And that prompted a reply from another user who wrote, okay, right, responding, okay, say it to your faces, people think Hitler was right, okay, I'll talk to you [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=172.4s)]
*  Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=182.3s)]
*  They claim to want people to stop using against them [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=187.3s)]
*  You want truth said to your face, there it is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=190.3s)]
*  I wish I could say this was a fringe view, but is a vile and over century old anti-semitic conspiracy theory [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=194.3s)]
*  Basically the Jewish people in coordination with people of color are a kind of conspiracy to assault whiteness [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=201.3s)]
*  And in fact that Jews are behind this conspiracy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=210.2s)]
*  This same conspiracy which has sort of come to be known as the Great Wall Replacement Theory [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=214.2s)]
*  That Jews are the sort of puppet masters manipulating American immigration policy to replace white people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=219.2s)]
*  This has permeated into a large swath of the American right [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=224.2s)]
*  We saw it in Charlottesville most infamously in 2017 where the marchers chanted, Jews will not replace us [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=228.2s)]
*  It was this view that was the inspiration for the perpetrator of the horrific anti-semitic mass murder at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018 [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=236.1s)]
*  The killer said so himself [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=247.1s)]
*  So Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, one of the most powerful influential men in the world, the owner of this platform [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=250.1s)]
*  Replied to the post espousing that vile theory, replied to this post that replied to someone calling out those who think Hitler is right [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=258.1s)]
*  And said okay, he says this to the guy that said that theory, you have said the actual truth [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=265.0s)]
*  The actual truth, Jews coordinating this assault on whiteness [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=273.0s)]
*  So shocking and repellent that Elon Musk, a man of the highest echelons of our society, would not just say something like that but actually believe it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=280.0s)]
*  It's a reminder that anti-semitism is dangerous and enduring even at the very highest levels of American society [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=288.9s)]
*  And we should be clear, there's a real history of this in this country [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=295.9s)]
*  Many notable powerful American figures through the ages were just rank anti-semites [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=299.9s)]
*  Probably the most notorious example is actually a man who is probably the closest historical analog to Elon Musk in many ways, Henry Ford [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=305.9s)]
*  Of course, Ford was the founder of the Ford Motor Company, the perfector of assembly line production, one of the wealthiest and most influential men of the earliest 20th century [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=315.8s)]
*  One of the great industrialists of the world history [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=324.8s)]
*  And he was also, as many people know, an anti-semite [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=328.8s)]
*  But the zealousness, the viciousness with which he pursued that cause of hating Jews [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=331.8s)]
*  The cause of global persecution of Jewish people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=339.8s)]
*  That I think has been a bit under emphasized in our collective recollection [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=343.7s)]
*  It's not an asterisk to Henry Ford's legacy, it's right at the center [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=348.7s)]
*  In fact, before the rise of Adolf Hitler, Henry Ford was probably the most powerful anti-semite in the world [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=353.7s)]
*  This is a topic of Rachel Maddow's remarkable new book, Prequel, about fascist sympathizers in the United States around World War II and those who defeated them [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=360.7s)]
*  And this past weekend, I got a chance to speak with Rachel for a live episode of my podcast, Why Is This Happening? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=370.6s)]
*  And she read us an excerpt about Henry Ford's story [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=377.6s)]
*  He was one of the most successful and celebrated industrialists on the planet [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=381.6s)]
*  His anti-semitism was rank and it was unchecked [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=387.6s)]
*  He spewed it freely in private tirades among friends, family, close business cohorts, newspaper reporters, or pretty much anybody within earshot [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=391.6s)]
*  Ford was hardly the only radical anti-semite in the US circa 1920, but in addition to his fortune and his famous name and his iconic company [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=399.5s)]
*  He had a megaphone your average crazy uncle theorizer lacked [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=407.5s)]
*  He had Twitter, no I'm kidding, sorry [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=412.5s)]
*  Sorry, it's X, I'm supposed to say X, yeah [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=416.5s)]
*  He had a newspaper, it was called the Dearborn Independent [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=420.5s)]
*  Every week for 92 weeks, headlines like these [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=426.4s)]
*  The International Jew, the world's problem [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=430.4s)]
*  And Jewish jazz, moron music becomes our national music [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=433.4s)]
*  And this one, the perils of baseball, too much Jew [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=439.4s)]
*  His headlines were splashed onto the pages of Ford's paper which was distributed in Ford dealerships across the country [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=444.4s)]
*  Ford also saw the publication of his series in book form [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=451.4s)]
*  It was titled The International Jew, it ran to four volumes [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=454.3s)]
*  The German edition of Ford's book had landed in the hands of one particularly gifted propagandist [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=459.3s)]
*  When Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf was published in 1925 [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=464.3s)]
*  The author appeared to lift not just ideas, but whole passages from Ford's own publications [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=468.3s)]
*  Mein Kampf's first edition extolled Ford by name [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=474.3s)]
*  When a reporter from the Detroit News showed up at Nazi Party headquarters in Munich [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=479.3s)]
*  In December 1931 to interview Hitler [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=483.2s)]
*  She had a series that was called Five Minutes with Men in Public Eye [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=486.2s)]
*  And she had her five minutes with Hitler [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=491.2s)]
*  When she went to Hitler's office, she was surprised to find, hanging on the wall behind Hitler's desk [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=495.2s)]
*  A large framed portrait of a very famous American [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=500.2s)]
*  Hitler explained to the newspaper woman, I regard Henry Ford as my inspiration [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=505.2s)]
*  Wild, right? Didn't know it until I read the book [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=513.2s)]
*  That was just part of our wide-ranging two-hour conversation [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=516.2s)]
*  If you want to hear more, you're in luck [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=519.2s)]
*  The incredible with pod episode will be streaming exclusively on Peacock starting this Friday, November 17th [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=521.2s)]
*  Now, to be clear, Elon Musk is not at the Henry Ford level yet [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=526.2s)]
*  There are real warning signs emanating from one of the world's most powerful men and from society at large [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=533.2s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is on the rise, it's real, it's dangerous [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=539.2s)]
*  In the case of Elon Musk, it is just staring us in the face [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=543.2s)]
*  Today, President Biden addressed the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in California [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=547.2s)]
*  Following his meeting yesterday with Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=554.2s)]
*  The White House is touting a number of concrete deliverables from that meeting [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=557.2s)]
*  Including a new deal on restricting the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=561.2s)]
*  The resumption of military-to-military communications between Washington and Beijing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=566.2s)]
*  Which had been suspended and even, perhaps most crucially, progress on a deal to bring new pandas to America's zoos [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=571.1s)]
*  But of course, the summit takes place against the backdrop of the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=578.1s)]
*  Which the president was once again faced questions over during a press conference last night [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=585.1s)]
*  John Kirby serves as deputy assistant to the president as well as coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=590.1s)]
*  And he joins me now [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=598.1s)]
*  It's great to have you in the program [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=599.1s)]
*  Thanks for joining us [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=600.1s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. Good to be with you [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=601.1s)]
*  I want to start with a claim the president made last night during that press conference [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=604.1s)]
*  We played it earlier in which he said that Hamas had hidden a headquarters underneath the hospital [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=611.1s)]
*  Obviously, that's a contested claim, an intensely contested claim [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=616.1s)]
*  And a high-stakes one because it gets to whether that's a legitimate military target [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=621.1s)]
*  And I wonder, since it is such an important and contested claim [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=626.1s)]
*  If we can expect some proof will be furnished by American or Israeli officials? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=629.0s)]
*  Well, the Israelis have already, as you've seen, and I think you just went through before the commercial break [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=635.0s)]
*  Talking about how they have made public their findings in the hospital [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=642.0s)]
*  I can't speak to specific intelligence other than to say that based on our own intelligence assessment [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=645.0s)]
*  On our own collection and analysis of what we've seen [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=652.0s)]
*  We believe that it isn't true, it is true that a command and control node was underneath that hospital [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=655.9s)]
*  And that Hamas has used that hospital not only for storage of weapons [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=661.9s)]
*  But also to house some of their fighters [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=665.9s)]
*  So we have no doubt in our mind, just from our own intelligence analysis [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=668.9s)]
*  That Hamas was using that hospital [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=673.9s)]
*  And look, that's out of their playbook [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=675.9s)]
*  This is what they do [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=677.9s)]
*  They find ways to headquarter themselves in civilian infrastructure [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=678.9s)]
*  Digging tunnels under homes [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=682.9s)]
*  Placing innocent civilians in the crossfire between them and the IDF [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=683.8s)]
*  Just to follow up on that, and obviously sometimes intelligence can be wrong [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=688.8s)]
*  I mean, notably I remember covering, of course, the strike after the brutal suicide bombing outside the Bagram [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=693.8s)]
*  Outside the Kabul air base [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=700.8s)]
*  In which someone who the US intelligence believed was an ISIS fighter [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=703.8s)]
*  Was actually just an innocent civilian happened [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=707.8s)]
*  It does seem important, I think, just for global public opinion particularly [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=710.7s)]
*  That people do get furnished some sort of tangible proof [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=714.7s)]
*  I mean, independent of whether the US government believes it, the Israeli government [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=719.7s)]
*  There is quite a bit of global public attention being paid to this conflict [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=723.7s)]
*  And particularly the plight of the folks that were in that hospital [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=728.7s)]
*  Yeah, there is indeed, you're absolutely right about that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=732.7s)]
*  And as I said, the Israeli defense forces, this is their operation [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=735.7s)]
*  And while they're on the ground, they have been releasing imagery [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=739.6s)]
*  They have been taking camera crews in there and showing the things that they've been finding [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=742.6s)]
*  Again, it perfectly corroborates our own intelligence [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=746.6s)]
*  I don't have anything to announce tonight in terms of the release of any particular US intelligence [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=749.6s)]
*  I can just again assert that our own analysis corroborates the claim [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=754.6s)]
*  That Hamas was using this as a command and control note [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=758.6s)]
*  And again, I would remind, this is a common tactic for them [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=760.6s)]
*  This is a page out of their playbook [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=763.6s)]
*  They're deliberately placing patients and hospital staff at greater risk [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=765.5s)]
*  And I want to ask one more question on this, particularly in hospitals [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=769.5s)]
*  But it applies to the broader contours of the conflict [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=773.5s)]
*  As you said, as Israeli officials have said, there are tunnels underneath Gaza [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=777.5s)]
*  That there are civilian infrastructure that's been utilized for Hamas fighters [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=781.5s)]
*  There's videos the IDF has released from schools [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=785.5s)]
*  Where they say they found rocket launch sites [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=789.5s)]
*  I want to play this clip because it's gotten a lot of attention about the targeting of civilian structures [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=792.4s)]
*  And it's by Anthony Blinken and he's talking about the Russians in Ukraine [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=796.4s)]
*  And you've probably seen this, it's been circulating a lot on social media [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=800.4s)]
*  Where he's condemning the targeting of that civilian infrastructure [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=803.4s)]
*  Please take a look [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=807.4s)]
*  Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=809.4s)]
*  Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not normal [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=814.4s)]
*  We must not let President Putin's callous indifference to human life become our own [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=821.3s)]
*  I guess the question becomes if there is Hamas military infrastructure embedded in civilian infrastructure [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=827.3s)]
*  Whether the U.S. has communicated to Israel what lengths they have to go to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=835.3s)]
*  Or what the lines are for what would make a piece of civilian infrastructure a legitimate military target [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=840.3s)]
*  I don't think there's a single conversation that we're having with our Israeli counterparts [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=847.2s)]
*  Where we don't talk about and urge them to be as cautious and deliberate and careful as they can [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=853.2s)]
*  With respect to civilian infrastructure and of course civilian lives [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=858.2s)]
*  Urban warfare is difficult and we have experience of our own in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=862.2s)]
*  And we have shared our perspectives and our lessons learned [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=867.2s)]
*  And we urge them again to be as deliberate and careful as they can [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=870.2s)]
*  I want to make two points here though [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=873.2s)]
*  One, every civilian killed, every civilian wounded, that's a tragedy [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=875.1s)]
*  And we know there's a whole family that's grieving as a result [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=879.1s)]
*  And now there are many, many thousands of families that are grieving and hurting right now [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=882.1s)]
*  And we want all that suffering to stop [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=886.1s)]
*  That's why we're going to continue to talk to our Israeli counterparts about being careful [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=889.1s)]
*  And being deliberate in their targeting [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=893.1s)]
*  The second point I want to make is unlike the fight in Ukraine [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=895.1s)]
*  Where the destruction of civilian infrastructure [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=899.1s)]
*  And the taking of civilian lives is actually a war aim of President Putin [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=902.0s)]
*  He wants to wipe out Ukraine's culture, history, and not just to mention their country [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=907.0s)]
*  That is also a war aim of Hamas [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=912.0s)]
*  That is what they did on October 7th, paragliding into a music festival [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=915.0s)]
*  And slaughtering innocent people in front of their family members [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=919.0s)]
*  They want to wipe Israel off the map [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=922.0s)]
*  It is not a war aim of the Israeli defense forces [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=924.0s)]
*  To kill innocent civilians and to destroy civilian infrastructure [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=927.0s)]
*  They are going about this in a very aggressive way [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=930.9s)]
*  And we are talking to them again about the way they do it [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=933.9s)]
*  But it's important to remember the distinction here [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=936.9s)]
*  Hamas is actually committing war crimes by headquartering in hospitals [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=938.9s)]
*  The Israeli defense forces are not making it a war aim to kill innocent people [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=941.9s)]
*  Let me ask you a question on China since that was the subject [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=946.9s)]
*  That was the huge news yesterday [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=950.9s)]
*  And just about for folks, we talked to John Brennan yesterday [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=952.9s)]
*  That don't understand what military to military communications mean [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=954.9s)]
*  And particularly what normalizing them means and what their significance is [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=958.8s)]
*  Why is that significant that those have been restored after being suspended? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=962.8s)]
*  Man, it's a big deal [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=968.8s)]
*  I mean, to not have two of the most powerful militaries on the face of the planet [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=969.8s)]
*  In the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=973.8s)]
*  Having aircraft operating in proximity, ships operating in proximity [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=977.8s)]
*  And not have an ability to pick up the phone [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=981.8s)]
*  And call somebody on the other side and explain what you're doing [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=984.8s)]
*  And why you're doing it and try to de-conflict [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=987.7s)]
*  That's a real dangerous precedent [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=989.7s)]
*  The president said that very clearly yesterday [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=992.7s)]
*  I mean, it could get into big trouble very, very quickly [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=994.7s)]
*  And so those communications have been shut down since Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=997.7s)]
*  And we're obviously glad now that that process is ongoing [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1004.7s)]
*  And the thing about this, Chris, is it goes from the commander-on-chief down to a lower level [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1007.7s)]
*  And that's really important too [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1011.7s)]
*  Because it can't, not every potential conflict [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1013.7s)]
*  Every potential operation should go all the way to the leader level [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1016.6s)]
*  So down at the theater command level and even lower now [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1020.6s)]
*  Our two militaries are going to be able to communicate [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1022.6s)]
*  That's a good thing for stability and security in the Indo-Pacific [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1025.6s)]
*  All right, John Kirby, national security spokesman for the White House [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1029.6s)]
*  I really appreciate you taking time [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1033.6s)]
*  Come back any time [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1034.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uCs_ShXwI&t=1046.6s)]
