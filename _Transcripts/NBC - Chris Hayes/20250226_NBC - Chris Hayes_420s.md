# ‘Nightmare scenario’: Fears grow as RFK Jr. downplays deadly measles outbreak
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc)
*  Today we're learning about the death of a child in Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the first death from measles in this country in a decade. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=3.0s)]
*  It was an unvaccinated child in West Texas, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=6.68s)]
*  where an outbreak with at least 124 reported cases since late last month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=9.08s)]
*  The death is particularly alarming since America declared measles eliminated a quarter century ago, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=14.68s)]
*  thanks to tireless research and mass vaccination efforts. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=20.04s)]
*  Now it's back. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=24.2s)]
*  And today our brand new Secretary of Health and Human Services, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=26.04s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., probably best known for spreading anti-vaccine propaganda, is in charge. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=28.8s)]
*  We're watching it and there are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=36.6s)]
*  We're watching it, we put out a post on it yesterday and we're going to continue to follow it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=42.6s)]
*  Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country last year, there were 16. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=47.6s)]
*  So it's not unusual if you have measles outbreaks every year. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=56.6s)]
*  Well, no, that's not quite true. Actually, first of all, it's only February. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=60.6s)]
*  But it is highly unusual. A child is dead from a disease that has not killed anyone in this country for 10 years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=63.6s)]
*  That is unusual. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=69.6s)]
*  It's also not true that the 20 hospitalized kids are there mainly for quarantine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=71.6s)]
*  What the head of HHS said to the nation about a measles outbreak was not true. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=76.6s)]
*  According to the chief medical officer in Lubbock, Texas, they're being treated. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=82.6s)]
*  All were admitted because, quote, they were having trouble breathing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=86.6s)]
*  This is a real nightmare scenario, something people warned about as Donald Trump floated, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=92.6s)]
*  tapping R.F.K. Jr. to lead HHS, pointing to his involvement in a deadly measles outbreak in Samoa back in 2019. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=96.6s)]
*  Listen to this from a PBS documentary. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=103.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm aware there was a measles outbreak, but I didn't have anything, you know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=107.6s)]
*  I have nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=111.6s)]
*  I never told anybody not to vaccinate. I didn't go there for any reason to do with that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=117.6s)]
*  One news has learned of a high-level anti-vax meeting just before this deadly measles outbreak, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=124.6s)]
*  a meeting between vaccination critic Robert Kennedy Jr. and anti-vax blogger Taylor Winterstein. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=130.6s)]
*  That right there is a guy charged with monitoring this new measles outbreak here in the U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=137.6s)]
*  after the first death in a decade from a disease once considered eradicated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=141.6s)]
*  Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=146.6s)]
*  Dr. Peter Hotez, the co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=150.6s)]
*  also a dean of the National College of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=154.6s)]
*  author of The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science, a Scientist's Warning, and he joins me now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=157.6s)]
*  Dr., it's great to have you. It's under terrible circumstances. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=162.6s)]
*  You have been working on vaccines, battling vaccine disinformation, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=165.6s)]
*  and warning about it in Texas specifically where you live and work for over a decade now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=169.6s)]
*  What's your reaction to all this? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=174.6s)]
*  Yeah, this is heartbreaking, Chris. I mean, this is a school-aged child who is unvaccinated. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=177.6s)]
*  This child did not have to lose his or her life. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=182.6s)]
*  And the problem is we're still in the early stages of this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=186.6s)]
*  This is a very large and dangerous measles epidemic. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=189.6s)]
*  The reported number of cases is over 100, 124. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=193.6s)]
*  It's now spilling over into the adjacent county in New Mexico. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=197.6s)]
*  Possibly it'll go up into Oklahoma. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=201.6s)]
*  This is still in the early stages because remember the measles incubation period is two weeks. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=204.6s)]
*  So this is what we're hearing about now, but we're going to have to wait two weeks to see what the next crop is. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=209.6s)]
*  So this is likely hundreds of cases. A lot of them are not going diagnosed. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=214.6s)]
*  Kids are piling into the hospital. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=219.6s)]
*  And in the worst nightmare of all, having a measles death, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=222.6s)]
*  20 percent of kids with measles in the United States require hospitalization, Chris. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=227.6s)]
*  And they don't do it for quarantine. They do it for measles pneumonia, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=233.6s)]
*  which is a giant cell pneumonia, which is a life-threatening infection. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=236.6s)]
*  They do it for measles diarrhea, which causes acute dehydration. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=240.6s)]
*  They do it for measles encephalitis, which is life-threatening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=243.6s)]
*  They do it. They're hospitalized for deafness resulting from measles otitis, ear infection and hospitalization. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=246.6s)]
*  This is a bad, bad actor. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=253.6s)]
*  And I'm really concerned that this thing is continuing to accelerate and expand. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=255.6s)]
*  You know, one of the things we've seen in Texas, we saw that have this chart of the sort of exemptions from vaccination, personal belief exemptions over time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=261.6s)]
*  You can see them just skyrocket up, obviously. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=268.6s)]
*  And when you get below that 95 percent herd immunity, that's where, you know, the outbreak in this case started in Mennonite community. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=271.6s)]
*  They don't have a theological objection, I should note, to vaccination. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=278.6s)]
*  But because it's a community where people don't go to public schools, they're not running into the vaccine requirements. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=282.6s)]
*  There's low vaccination rates. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=289.6s)]
*  And it just strikes me that like this is why herd immunity is so important, right? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=291.6s)]
*  Because if you have herd immunity, then if you have a small religious community that's sort of outside of the public school system, they're protected by everyone else's herd immunity. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=295.6s)]
*  Well, it's starting in a small religious community that really has no prohibitions against vaccinations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=303.6s)]
*  I mean, what's happening is in Texas, we have a very aggressive predatory anti-vaccine lobby that actually receives PAC money, political action committee money, to do their work. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=310.6s)]
*  And that really concerns me. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=320.6s)]
*  And so even though it's starting in the Mennonite community, it's expanding pretty rapidly, I think, into other parts of West Texas where vaccination rates are also low. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=323.6s)]
*  And, you know, it's the parents themselves are in some ways victims there because they were targeted by anti-vaccine activists for this purpose. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=335.6s)]
*  We obviously have an anti-vaxxer now who is the head of HHS. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=345.6s)]
*  And there's three three headlines I saw today. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=351.6s)]
*  HHS halts oral COVID vaccine trial. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=354.6s)]
*  Kennedy has paused a multimillion dollar contract from the Biden administration to create a new COVID-19 vaccine that can be taken orally. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=358.6s)]
*  So for folks that don't like shots and there's some evidence to suggest shots are actually a fairly big impediment, they've paused that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=364.6s)]
*  Bloomberg today, Trump team weighs pulling funds for Moderna bird flu vaccine. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=370.6s)]
*  Part of a government push to examine spending on RNA based vaccines. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=376.6s)]
*  That contract's already signed. It's unclear they could take the money back, but that's happening. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=380.6s)]
*  And then this last one, FDA flu shot meeting canceled. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=384.6s)]
*  Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Advisory Committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains be included in next season. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=389.6s)]
*  Flu shot has been canceled. A panel members of Wednesday. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=397.6s)]
*  You [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkL3cnyjGc&t=410.6s)]
