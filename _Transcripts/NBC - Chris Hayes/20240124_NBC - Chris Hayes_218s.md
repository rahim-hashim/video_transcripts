# Lindsey Graham ‘threw Trump under the bus’ in Georgia testimony, new book says
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM)
*  The original Trump critic turned Trump's sycophant. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=0.0s)]
*  Perhaps the most squirrely of them all is Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=3.0s)]
*  Back in 2015, Senator Graham was running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=7.0s)]
*  and he was about as critical as it gets. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=12.0s)]
*  I think he's a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit for office. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=16.0s)]
*  He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=20.0s)]
*  He's a jackass. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=24.0s)]
*  You know how you make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=25.0s)]
*  But then after he lost the primary and Donald Trump became president, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=30.0s)]
*  Graham did a complete 180. He wanted so badly to be close to the man in power, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=33.0s)]
*  and he was willing to humiliate himself to get there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=37.0s)]
*  In October of Trump's first year in office, Senator Graham tweeted about a round of golf he played with the president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=40.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=45.0s)]
*  President Trump shot a 73 in windy and wet conditions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=46.0s)]
*  How bad did he beat me? I did better in the presidential race than today in the golf course! [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=49.0s)]
*  The slobbering continued up until January 6 when Senator Graham claimed he finally had enough. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=56.0s)]
*  Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=63.0s)]
*  I hate it then this way. Oh my God, I hate it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=66.0s)]
*  From my point of view, he's been a consequential president. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=69.0s)]
*  But today, first thing you'll see. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=72.0s)]
*  All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough. I've tried to be helpful. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=76.0s)]
*  By the way, consequential is funny. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=83.0s)]
*  Now, that didn't last long. Soon enough, Lindsey Graham was right back at it, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=85.0s)]
*  tearing up on Fox News as he literally begged viewers to send Donald Trump money. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=89.0s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm so upset, but please help President Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=98.0s)]
*  If you can afford five or ten bucks, if you can't afford a dollar fine, just pray. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=101.0s)]
*  Make sure you vote as early as you can in your state. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=106.0s)]
*  Don't risk anything anymore. Vote as soon as you can. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=109.0s)]
*  Pray for this country. Pray for this president. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=112.0s)]
*  And if you've got any money to give, give it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=115.0s)]
*  Bro, bro, come on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=118.0s)]
*  Now, nine years into this routine, Lindsey Graham has flip-flopped once again. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=122.0s)]
*  According to wild new reporting, Graham turned on a dime and, quote, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=126.0s)]
*  threw Trump under the bus during his grand jury testimony in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=130.0s)]
*  Trump faces 13 charges in that state in connection with his efforts to steal the 2020 election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=135.0s)]
*  Quote, Graham testified that if you told Trump that Martians came and stole the election, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=140.0s)]
*  he'd probably believe you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=145.0s)]
*  He also suggested to the grand jurors that Trump cheated at golf. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=146.0s)]
*  It got even weirder from there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=150.0s)]
*  After Graham was finished testifying, he bumped into District Attorney Fonny Willis in a hallway [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=152.0s)]
*  and thanked her for the opportunity to tell his story. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=157.0s)]
*  That was so cathartic, he told Willis. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=160.0s)]
*  I feel so much better. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=162.0s)]
*  Then, to the astonishment of one source who witnessed the scene, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=164.0s)]
*  South Carolina's senior senator hugged the Fulton County DA. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=167.0s)]
*  According to one witness, Willis was like, whatever, dude. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=171.0s)]
*  All of those crazy revelations come from a new book by journalists [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=175.0s)]
*  Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klademan titled Find Me the Votes, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=179.0s)]
*  a hard-charging Georgia prosecutor, a rogue president, and the plot to steal an American election. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=183.0s)]
*  I'm happy to report that Michael Isikoff will join me for an interview about the book [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=187.0s)]
*  and all those incredible details in it on Tuesday night next week. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=191.0s)]
*  So, Senator Graham, set your DVR. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=194.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEZvVGCRCiM&t=209.0s)]
