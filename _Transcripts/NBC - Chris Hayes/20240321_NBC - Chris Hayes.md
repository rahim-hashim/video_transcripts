# Sherrod Brown says his opponent is 'trying to buy this Senate seat'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo)
*  The Trump era Republican Party loves to brag about how it's now the party of working-class voters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=0.0s)]
*  But in practice the party still operates in near single-minded service of large corporations and the extremely wealthy people who run them [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=4.78s)]
*  And that focus on the 1% extends to the actual candidates themselves who they recruit [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=12.3s)]
*  As the New York Times points out this morning an awful lot of millionaires are running to help Republicans retake the Senate this cycle [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=18.14s)]
*  Like former coal baron Jim Justice in West Virginia former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=24.119999999999997s)]
*  commercial lending executive Eric Hovody in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=32.32s)]
*  Wisconsin and in the working-class state of Ohio Republicans just nominated a millionaire car dealer named Bernie Marino [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=35.56s)]
*  To face the incumbent three-term senator Sherry Brown [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=42.76s)]
*  Brown is a man who has dedicated his entire adult life to public service [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Actually helping the working-class a guy who according to the Times has a net worth of about [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=49.44s)]
*  $260,000 [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=56.04s)]
*  Brown is running for reelection in a state Donald Trump won twice by some estimates [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=57.16s)]
*  He is the most or among the most vulnerable Democrats running for reelection in the Senate this cycle [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=61.36s)]
*  With control the chamber in the balance of course the stakes could not be higher and Senator Sherrod Brown [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=66.6s)]
*  Democrat of Ohio a guy first profiled for Chicago magazine called in these times when I was 26 years old and he was running for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=71.56s)]
*  Senate the first time joins me now senator. It is good to see you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=77.68s)]
*  That was a great article back then [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=84.64s)]
*  It was fair was fun talking to you just about where you were coming from and what you're doing and I saw you with a future [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know MSNBC, but I knew something big so thank you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that you know the thing that I was thinking about is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  you I [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=98.84s)]
*  Was watching some of the the debates in the primary race the Republicans there [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  And I read a profile of the junior senator state JD Vance and one thing that is really striking to me is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=104.84s)]
*  That the vision you had the politics you had and the policy agenda you had which was to preserve [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=110.76s)]
*  Manufacturing and strong good union wage jobs and to fight for working people in the state of Ohio [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=118.0s)]
*  You were very much against NAFTA and the and the kind of pro [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=122.12s)]
*  Free trade consensus at the time in the Democratic Party you were very much for industrial policy and helping folks find that that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=126.72s)]
*  Vision has really come around from being this kind of weird thing at the margins to at the center [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=134.0s)]
*  Not just the Democratic Party, but in some ways Republicans kind of trying to get in on the action, too [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=140.0s)]
*  Well, and I I remember I went to Johnny Appleseed, Jr [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=145.28s)]
*  High in Mansfield, Ohio [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=148.38s)]
*  and I went to school with the sons and daughters of steelworkers that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=149.76s)]
*  It Empire Reaves of rubber workers of Mansfield tire of electric workers at Westinghouse and GM workers that I mean auto workers at GM [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=153.88s)]
*  Carpenters and electricians their sons and daughters and those jobs began to leave when I was in high school [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  They went to find the cheapest wages in Alabama and Mississippi [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=166.4s)]
*  And then politicians of both parties sold them out in these trade agreements [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  And it was clear the damage it did to these communities to these families to the sons and daughters [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  And I went to school with and it's clear to me that that the Democrats are back where we should be as a party [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  fighting for workers fighting for manufacturing and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  That's that's what I've always believed and it's it's what people want to hear in Ohio and they want to see their senator do [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=187.68s)]
*  Now you it's funny that we read your net worth, but it was reported in the New York Times [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  But you're gonna you're gonna be facing someone very deep pockets and it's gonna be a race a very expensive race [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  And I imagine they will spend a lot of money and there'll be super PACs with people writing seven-figure checks. I would imagine [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=204.72s)]
*  In your race. What do you see as a sort of key? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=211.6s)]
*  The key fight in this or the or the key way you understand the contrast with a guy who's gonna have a lot of money [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=215.12s)]
*  Behind him and and and the winded is back in some ways [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=221.44s)]
*  Well, he's a he's a guy that was trying to buy this Senate CD. He's a guy that clearly looks out for himself [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=224.64s)]
*  He has actually said I'm not gonna work with anybody. I disagree with in the Senate, which means, you know [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=230.8s)]
*  I mean, I work with people I disagree with we get the PACT Act to help [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=236.56s)]
*  Ten-thousand veterans already in Ohio will be hundreds of thousands. We got a pension bill [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=241.54s)]
*  We're a hundred thousand workers pensions were safe facing 50 60 percent cuts [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  We've passed an infrastructure bill which is putting hundreds of thousands of trade labor labor union union [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=251.46s)]
*  card-carrying trade union members [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=258.82s)]
*  Building trades people I mean all of that and he really takes it to the next level that Ohio passed as you know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=260.74s)]
*  Chris by 13 points you've covered it a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=266.86s)]
*  Constitutional member of abortion rights. He thinks he knows better and that's what some of these candidates are like [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=269.1s)]
*  He thinks he knows better. He's still for a national abortion ban [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=273.94s)]
*  Ignoring what the voters of Ohio want with no exceptions in six weeks. No exceptions [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=277.74s)]
*  So the the contours of this race are clear and only it's who's on your side [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=281.92s)]
*  I don't I don't really subscribe to the left or the right left and right progressive conservative [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=286.08s)]
*  I mean people know who I am. They know it's only whose side you want and I'll keep making those fights [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  You've been doing a lot of work and watching this on on train safety [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=295.7s)]
*  Speaking about sort of working across the aisle you and JD Vance actually have been working on a rail safety bill [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=301.82s)]
*  After that train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=307.7s)]
*  That bill has still not come up yet [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=311.94s)]
*  It seemed to have a lot of support [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  But I know that the railroad companies have been fighting it tooth or nail [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=316.18s)]
*  And I also know that you've spent a lot of time in East Palestine as the senator those folks [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=319.02s)]
*  How are those folks doing? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=324.3s)]
*  Well, I think it was the eighth eighth or ninth time [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=326.3s)]
*  I just went back last week and they want to get their lives back to normal [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=329.18s)]
*  They mostly have but I have fought to get the administration to make sure they continue to do health monitoring [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=332.66s)]
*  Paid for by Norfolk Southern because people don't really know their arms broken rash broke out in rashes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=338.66s)]
*  The Norfolk Southern is talked a good game. They've been helpful sometimes but they've got to commit to long-term health benefits [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=344.74s)]
*  It's a little you know exposure to that stuff. Nobody really knows what it means Norfolk Southern [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=351.26s)]
*  Essentially did a controlled burn that put this stuff into the air that didn't need to be as it turned out [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=356.54s)]
*  So this is a company. It's typical Wall Street model. They they laid off a third of their workforce. They paid huge [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  huge bonuses and stock buybacks they they cut back on inspections and on on [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  Heat sensors for the wheel bearings inspections of the tracks and look what happens [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=375.26s)]
*  And they continue to get their way far too often with Congress. We're gonna pass this bill [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=379.78s)]
*  I'm hopeful it's in the next month or so [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=384.34s)]
*  But the railroad lobby is really strong just like the drug lobby and the lobby it's up and down. You know that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=386.61999999999995s)]
*  Senator Sherrod Brown who'll be standing for reelection in the state of Ohio [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=394.02s)]
*  Thank you against Bernie Marino. Thanks. Thanks for having me on I asked people to come to SherrodBrown.com [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=397.73999999999995s)]
*  We need a huge grassroots effort. So thanks Chris. You bet. Thanks a lot [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=402.7s)]
*  You bet [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCupChTM6Jo&t=406.86s)]
