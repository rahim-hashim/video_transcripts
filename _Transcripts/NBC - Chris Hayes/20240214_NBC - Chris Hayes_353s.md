# 'Losing streak': GOP refuses to learn lessons from ‘crushing’ election losses
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY)
*  We've got the results of the first special election in 2024. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a huge loss for Republicans in New York's third congressional district. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=3.0s)]
*  Democrat Tom Swazi defeated Republican Mazzee Pillip by nearly eight points. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=7.44s)]
*  Swazi will now replace the expelled criminally indicted former Congressman George Santos, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=12.6s)]
*  bringing Republicans already tight majority in the House down to just six seats. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=17.32s)]
*  Now, you might think the day after the party would be wondering where they went wrong after such a crushing loss [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  in what was supposed to be a neck and neck tight race. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=27.52s)]
*  George Santos won this same district by nearly eight points just over a year ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=30.52s)]
*  Instead, Republicans are defiant in their defeat. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  The chair of the New York Republican Party, Ed Cox, released a statement saying in part, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=38.64s)]
*  Republicans will win this in November when the campaign resets to focus on Joe Biden and Democrats' disastrous open borders, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=42.64s)]
*  soft on crime policies rather than the specific circumstances that brought about this election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  And I got to say to me, this statement perfectly defines the difference between the two major parties. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=54.88s)]
*  Republicans approach each election with a kind of unbridled, undeserved confidence. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  They believe the voters are with them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=64.92s)]
*  They think they represent real Americans and therefore the real majority of the country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=66.64s)]
*  According to Republicans, Democrats are the party of the out-of-touch elite, the freaks, minorities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=72.0s)]
*  So Republicans should not have to think about whether their message is working or whether they are running good candidates. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=77.72s)]
*  It is simply their destiny. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=83.12s)]
*  It is their fate to be voted into power. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=84.8s)]
*  But of course, what we keep seeing over and over in 2020, 2022, and now 2024, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=87.88s)]
*  is that the majority of Americans do not like the candidates Republicans are running or the messages they are pushing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=94.16s)]
*  And the party refuses to learn that lesson in election after election. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=99.92s)]
*  They run unlikable candidates on ridiculous issues and they lose. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Mazzee Pilla was a soldier who fought terrorism, who supports stronger borders and lower taxes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=109.64s)]
*  Thomas Wazzie opened the border. Thomas Wazzie funding the sanctuary city. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  We will wage a war on the woke. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=121.16s)]
*  We will never, ever surrender to the woke mob. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  I'm Dave White and I'll never let CRT be taught in our classrooms. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=127.72s)]
*  There's nothing racist about stopping critical race theory. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=131.4s)]
*  We've got to get this transgender ideology out of our schools. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=134.68s)]
*  My senior year, I was forced to compete against a biological male. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  That's unfair in Rome. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=141.16s)]
*  Which one of you is from the New York Times? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  You know there's only two genders, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=146.92s)]
*  Every one of those candidates lost. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=150.2s)]
*  But the Republican Party didn't learn from Curry Lake and trans swimmers or Josh Mandel and CRT or Ron DeSantis in the war on woke. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=152.0s)]
*  They won't learn from Mazzee Pilla and crime in the border either. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  Imagine though, for a moment, if the shoe were on the other foot. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=162.48s)]
*  I mean, it was totally possible, right, that we wake up this morning and the Democrat had lost this race in New York. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  And just imagine, imagine the amount of second guessing that would be circulating in the party, in progressive and center-left circles, in the mainstream press, on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=169.6s)]
*  It would be constant because the Democratic Party and the larger coalition is in a near constant state of anxiety. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=179.92s)]
*  They're always worried that their coalition will crack, that they will lose the support of real Americans. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  I think part of that is because the party apparatus is in fact dominated by college educated people living in big metro areas, big cities, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=191.76s)]
*  who make up a disproportionate number of campaign, political staffers, actual elected officials and the media. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=200.16s)]
*  And especially since 2016, that group of folks really does fear they're missing something, something key about what voters not in those circles think. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=206.28s)]
*  Now, that fear that they're missing something can be pretty neurotic and debilitating. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=217.68s)]
*  It's the source of like the, you know, hundreds of diner safari pieces we've all read. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=222.0s)]
*  But I will say this, I think it's also an important, helpful effect. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=227.0s)]
*  The whole point of politics and elections is to win the support of a majority of people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  So if you're always worried about losing them, you have to really engage with what the voters think and feel, how to reach them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  It does, I think, keep the Democratic Party tethered to reality, while Republicans increasingly are just about the opposite of that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=242.44s)]
*  They are so convinced of their own virtue. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=249.4s)]
*  They've completely lost sight of the fact that on a lot of topics, they're the ones that actually sound like freaks and weirdos. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=251.6s)]
*  They are so certain they are the real Americans, they cannot see how far they are from them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=257.96s)]
*  Here's a perfect example. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=263.96s)]
*  Republicans about how lost Republicans are. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=266.76s)]
*  The conservative uproar about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=270.6s)]
*  Somehow Republicans are threatened by the image of the towering, square jawed, conventionally handsome star athlete kissing his blonde, red lipped, conventionally attractive pop star girlfriend. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=275.6s)]
*  He's from Ohio, plays for Kansas City. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  She got her start in Nashville with country music. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  She's Miss Americana and he's the heart-baked prince. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=289.72s)]
*  It's like a 1950s James Dean daydream. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=292.44s)]
*  They are quintessentially middle America, conservative coded as it gets. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=295.6s)]
*  Republicans have so alienated themselves from actual middle America that this is a threat to them now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=299.88s)]
*  They can't hear it, though. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=307.28s)]
*  They cannot learn from it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=308.64s)]
*  They cannot course correct. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=309.8s)]
*  They keep attacking America's prom king and queen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=311.44s)]
*  They plan to run Mazzie Pillop again in New York's third district in November, and she'll run the same issues. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=315.2s)]
*  And they still support Donald Trump. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  Because when you believe that you never have to listen to what the voters are telling you, you can pretend that you won an election that you lost by seven million votes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6eDAYrBlY&t=323.08s)]
