# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: June 13
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. A lot has happened on Capitol Hill since the last time Donald Trump was there. There was the deadly insurrection that he incited. There was the Biden inauguration that he skipped. There was the record setting second impeachment that he faced for the deadly insurrection he incited. And there was a time in the immediate aftermath of all that late January, February, March. It seemed he may never be welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=0.0s)]
*  But we know how that turned out. Today, the former president and his 34 felony convictions trek to Capitol Hill, the invitation of the House and Senate Republicans, where he was received like a different dawn, a crime dawn, seeking not supporters, but accomplices and co-conspirators. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=28.0s)]
*  They're using us as a bad example of democracy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=46.0s)]
*  And they're getting away with murder, and we're not going to let it happen. You're all either elected or you're going to be elected again and reelected. And I'm with every one of you. And you know that I'll be with you always. This is an outstanding group of people. I'm with them 1000%. There was me 1000%. We agreed just about on everything. And if there isn't, we work it out. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=50.0s)]
*  Now, the term kiss the ring has been used so often with Trump. It's virtually lost all meaning. But it would really was on display in Washington today. Everything about this appearance was meant to convey the idea of Republican Party unity. And they all performed it like incredibly strenuously. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=71.0s)]
*  That unity on Trump's terms, of course, essentially remaking the party of Lincoln into a mafia type operation with him at the very top. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=86.0s)]
*  The man who was just convicted in a conspiracy to pay off former paramour is because he feared their stories would complicate his election campaign. A man found libel for sexual assault of exactly the kind that he brags about. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=94.0s)]
*  A man who surrounded himself with lackeys who have also been convicted or charged with serious crimes from Steve Bannon to Peter Navarro to Paul Manafort to Roger Stone to Michael Flynn. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=107.0s)]
*  Trump himself has pardoned or commuted the sentences of many of those men. Of course, they never snitched. They're not rats. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=116.0s)]
*  Because Trump explicitly envisions his interactions with people in these sort of organized crime transactional terms. You do for me. And if I'm in a good mood, I'm happy with your performance. You'll get a cut. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=123.0s)]
*  And the Republican Party has signed up to be a part of this. That was on display today in his discussions with Capitol Hill Republicans behind closed doors. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=135.0s)]
*  As sources told Punch Bill News reporter Jake Sherman, Trump singled out House Republicans who had voted to impeach him, saying out of the 10 that impeached, only one is left. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=143.0s)]
*  Now, as Sherman pointed out, that was wrong. There are actually two left. But this was Trump basically doing his impression of Robert De Niro's Al Capone and the Untouchables, pointing out all the people in his gang who flipped on him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=152.0s)]
*  A sort of snitches get stitches stay on my good side message to foot soldiers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=164.0s)]
*  If you think that kind of pressure does not work, look at the outgoing Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Remember what he said about Trump in the aftermath of the Capitol insurrection? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=169.0s)]
*  There's no question. None. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=181.0s)]
*  None. The President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=182.0s)]
*  No question about it. This was an intensifying crescendo of conspiracy theories orchestrated by outgoing president who seemed determined to either overturn the voters decision or else torch. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=194.0s)]
*  Our institutions on the way out. And yet here was McConnell today, the old man, supplicant, submissive, bending over to kiss the ring, giving a breezy endorsement of Trump's Capitol Hill pilgrimage. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=212.0s)]
*  Senator, how was it seeing the former president? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=228.0s)]
*  Yeah, but we. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=230.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=234.0s)]
*  People. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=236.0s)]
*  From. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=238.0s)]
*  It was. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=240.0s)]
*  Positive. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=242.0s)]
*  Great work, Mitch. Now, despite all that, plenty of those adoring Republican lawmakers were feckless enough to anonymously trip out details of Trump's backroom talk to Sherman and other reporters. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=244.0s)]
*  Because again, you can never underestimate just how cowardly they are. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=254.0s)]
*  For instance, when Trump told the House Republicans today that Milwaukee, where we're having our convention, is a horrible city. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=258.0s)]
*  Another Republican source told reporters that Trump was rambling to the crowd, said it was like, and I quote, talking to your drunk uncle at the family reunion. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=265.0s)]
*  Of course, in public, those anonymous Republican sources will fundamentally get in line, kiss the ring, give the dom whatever he wants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=274.0s)]
*  And maybe you think this is all being too literal on my part. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=281.0s)]
*  You know, hyperbolic with the metaphors, crime bosses, accomplices surely doesn't explicitly embrace actual criminal gangs and racketeering and violence as a campaign feature. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=285.0s)]
*  But this is now actually part of this campaign. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=295.0s)]
*  Listen closely to this, because. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=298.0s)]
*  I still can't get over this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=300.0s)]
*  It flew almost completely beneath the radar of the mainstream media. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=303.0s)]
*  I'll include us with this, with the exception of the Associated Press and a few others. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=307.0s)]
*  But it was on display at his campaign rally last month in the Bronx when he shared the stage with a few supportive guests. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=311.0s)]
*  Rapper Chef G. Does everybody know Chef? Where is Chef G.? Where is he? Come on up, fellas. Rapper Sleepy Hallow. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=318.0s)]
*  They always gonna whisper your accomplishments and shout your failures. Trump gonna shout the wins for all of us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=329.0s)]
*  Make America great again. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=337.0s)]
*  Okay, so Trump's doing a rally in the Bronx to Trump. Those rappers are valuable political allies to the district attorney in Brooklyn. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=339.0s)]
*  They are also criminal defendants in a sweeping, extensive gang case where prosecutors say they gave material support to a Crips gang during a violent street war with another gang. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=346.0s)]
*  Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez says the gang members use more than 30 guns to threaten or eliminate their rivals. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=359.0s)]
*  In total, Gonzalez says there was one murder, four attempted murders and 12 non-fatal shootings. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=366.0s)]
*  What we allege and what we learned during the course of this investigation is that Chef G. used a lot of the money that he earned to help facilitate further gang activity. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=372.0s)]
*  He encouraged gang members to participate in violent crimes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=385.0s)]
*  Chef G. who's the rapper who was on stage with Donald Trump that he invited up there. Prosecutors allege Chef G. threw a party in Manhattan steakhouse for gang members to celebrate a drive-by shooting in October 2020 in which one alleged rival gang member was killed and five others were injured. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=389.0s)]
*  Murder again, alleged, innocent until proven guilty in our system. But did you hear all that? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=407.0s)]
*  Imagine what the New York Post would have done with this headline if those two gentlemen had shown up at a rally for AOC or if President Joe Biden introduced them on stage. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=412.0s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is that the Republican Party conservatives have a criminal as their preferred nominee and is embracing a criminal model for their own political party. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=423.0s)]
*  Surprise, there are even more undisclosed private jet trips. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=434.0s)]
*  Tonight we're learning that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas took at least three private jet trips paid for by his very generous benefactor billionaire Republican Harlan Crowe. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=439.0s)]
*  According to an ongoing investigation by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee tonight, ProPublica is reporting the newly revealed flights add to the picture of Thomas's frequent use of Crowe's jet for personal travel, allowing the justice to fly in the style of the ultra wealthy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=450.0s)]
*  That sounds nice. A jet that can cost over $10,000 per flight hour to charter, according to the Charter Company estimates, and Thomas has repeatedly flown to a destination backing on the same day. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=465.0s)]
*  That sounds like nice. Nice way to go. In a statement, Thomas's lawyer said the charter company is going to be able to get a $10,000 per flight hour to charter. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=476.0s)]
*  And Thomas has repeatedly flown to a destination backing on the same day. That sounds like nice. Nice way to go. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=485.0s)]
*  In a statement, Thomas's lawyer said the trips, quote, fell under the personal hospitality exemption and was not required to be disclosed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=493.0s)]
*  Justin Elliott is one of the reporters from ProPublica who broke the story and many other stories about the undisclosed guests to both Justice Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=500.0s)]
*  He and the rest of his team at ProPublica won a Pulitzer for the reporting on the Supreme Court last year and he joins me now. Congratulations on that Pulitzer, by the way. Thank you. Well earned. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=509.0s)]
*  All right. Three more trips. What do we learned? Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about this is so striking to me is just the scale of it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=516.0s)]
*  I mean, we're really looking at a picture where Harlan Crowe's private jet, as you said, Global 5000, which I'm told is a particularly nice type of private jet, was just at the disposal of Justice Thomas. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=522.0s)]
*  I mean, there's multiple incidents where, for example, flying from Washington, D.C. to San Jose, California, staying there for a few hours and then turning around and going back in the same day. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=533.0s)]
*  That's happened repeatedly. So and we see the jet going from where it's based in Dallas to D.C. to pick up the justice. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=543.0s)]
*  And so this adds to a very long list. And I think the picture is you have a billionaire political donor really in a real way subsidizing the life of a justice. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=549.0s)]
*  Yeah. And basically, I mean, the New Deal deals, they don't make clear the purpose of the trip. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=558.0s)]
*  They include a May 27 trip to St. Louis from St. Louis to Kalispel, Montana, location of Glacier Park International Airport, then from Montana to Dallas. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=562.0s)]
*  Two days later, you schedule being St. Louis, the time for a speech. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=570.0s)]
*  In one instance, he flew from the East Coast to San Jose, returned home later that day. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=573.0s)]
*  Another he took a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Savannah, Georgia. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=577.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, this is the kind of thing you only really get to do if you're a billionaire. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=581.0s)]
*  Just like, you know, this is how like Taylor Swift or Elon. That's how they get around. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=585.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, the San Jose round trip alone again, seemingly for maybe some kind of lunch. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=589.0s)]
*  We don't know what it was for still. That could easily cost well over one hundred thousand dollars. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=593.0s)]
*  Just just the flight. So, you know, probably double the median income that an American makes in a year. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=598.0s)]
*  So it's it's an extraordinary amount of money. And this is on top of a thousand dollar flight. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=604.0s)]
*  Yeah. And last week, you know, Justice Thomas actually, after some of our reporting, amended some prior years financial disclosure forms to disclose other things that Harlan Crowe has paid for hotels and lodging and vacation in Indonesia, a trip to California. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=608.0s)]
*  And that's the third time he's done that in the last 10 or 15. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=623.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, these three ones no one knew about and no one reported. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=626.0s)]
*  Yeah, these are totally new to us. I mean, you had no idea. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=630.0s)]
*  I had no idea. I mean, you know, but I'm pretty sure. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=633.0s)]
*  Let me just say this is it right. I mean, this has to be totally. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=636.0s)]
*  There's no way there's anything else. I think we have an absolute definitive accounting. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=639.0s)]
*  I mean, look, some of the reporting we did, it took, you know, myself and some co-workers months of reporting to piece together these trips and other gifts that Justice Thomas and Justice Alito also got. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=643.0s)]
*  We don't have subpoena power. The Senate Judiciary Committee does. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=654.0s)]
*  They said today that there's going to be a fuller report of their findings of this investigation coming out in the summer. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=658.0s)]
*  So I would not all be surprised if there's more revelations in that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=664.0s)]
*  They subpoenaed Leonard Leo as well, who basically told him to like go pound sand, pound sand. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=668.0s)]
*  Thank you for stopping me from saying what I was going to say to go pound sand. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=676.0s)]
*  And I don't know what's happening there, but Harlan Crowe, they subpoenaed. He's he's cooperating right there, getting this from Harlan Crowe, I think. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=680.0s)]
*  Right. This is this is from Harlan Crowe. What happened was they authorized the subpoena, didn't actually issue it and became sort of a leverage in their negotiations with his lawyers. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=686.0s)]
*  And they came to this deal where he he's given them information about the last seven years, potentially not just travel, potentially other things, too. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=694.0s)]
*  I think we'll only find out when the full investigation comes out later this summer. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=702.0s)]
*  We're going to have to update our bar chart. Can we show the bar chart? My favorite bar chart. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=706.0s)]
*  It's a tough one to read. It's really hard to see when. Let's see, which one is Thomas? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=710.0s)]
*  Let me scan there. All right, there is on the left. So we might we might have to we might need to raise up that bar after we we we price these these ones in. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=714.0s)]
*  Maybe this summer we'll get more pricing. Can I get it? Can I get your responses? I have you here to something Justice Alito said about your reporting because he talks about you and I want you to be able to respond directly. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=724.0s)]
*  This is something that he said recently, surreptitiously recorded of our public. I take a listen. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=734.0s)]
*  There are groups that are very well funded. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=741.0s)]
*  I have realized that. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=745.0s)]
*  Spirit. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=749.0s)]
*  Like. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=750.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=753.0s)]
*  I'm going to get a lot of gets a lot of money. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=755.0s)]
*  And they have spent. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=760.0s)]
*  Investigating. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=762.0s)]
*  Have you spent a fortune on are these ideological attacks? What you're doing? Yeah, I mean, it was frankly disturbing to hear this because it's pure speculation based on no evidence as one of the two or three reporters that did this work. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=767.0s)]
*  I can tell you how it started, which was not we're going to report on Justice Thomas and Justice Alito. It was we're going to report on how Supreme Court justices are spending their time when they're not at the court. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=780.0s)]
*  Started with a stack of documents of travel records, no names of the justices, and we piece together that it was Justice Thomas who was taking private jets around. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=790.0s)]
*  We took a hard look at some of the Democratic appointed justices and just have simply not found anything equivalent. Well, again, if we could put up that bar chart just for a second again, it is hard to find the signal from the noise in that chart. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=799.0s)]
*  You know, just it is it takes a real it takes a lot of energy just to uncover that one on the left. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=811.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. I mean, if somebody out there knows about George Soros funding justice, I would be I would love to report and you can find my contact information on all of our stories. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=817.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the scoop. Great reporting. Thank you. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=828.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden is in Italy today, meeting with the world leaders for the 50th G seven summit this morning, the group posed to the classic family photo. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=832.0s)]
*  Now, this version of that picture edited by political scientist Ian Bremmer reveals something very important, but the leaders, the world's biggest economies, they are all really unpopular. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=841.0s)]
*  Those numbers above their heads are their net disapproval ratings with Joe Biden actually coming in second underwater by only 18.5 points. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=853.0s)]
*  And there is one big reason why these leaders are also unpopular. All of the G seven nations and most of the world have faced levels of inflation not seen for decades. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=862.0s)]
*  Of course, none of the leaders are directly responsible for that. As you can see, the jump inflation coincided with the end of the pandemic. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=873.0s)]
*  It was a result of an enormous surge in pent up demand amidst a pandemic induced constraint on supply. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=880.0s)]
*  But voters totally understandably and rationally hate inflation. It's been three or four years of prices going up and up and they blame the incumbent party. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=887.0s)]
*  Here in the US, the consumer price index and measurement of inflation hit a whopping nine percent in the summer of 2022. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=897.0s)]
*  And we've actually recovered well to relatively well since then, better than many of our G seven counterparts. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=904.0s)]
*  The index dropped down to three point three percent as of yesterday's report. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=909.0s)]
*  Now, that, of course, crucially is the rate of increase. Right. Prices are going up at a low slower rate. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=914.0s)]
*  Cumulatively, prices are still way up here and everywhere. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=919.0s)]
*  But the truth is that Joe Biden didn't really have a lot to do with the fact this line went up or that it went down. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=924.0s)]
*  That's mostly circumstances outside his control. The Fed. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=931.0s)]
*  Now, I will say this. Joe Biden's administration has tried very hard to cut costs for Americans wherever they can, taking steps to lower prescription drug costs, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=936.0s)]
*  canceling student debt, getting rid of all kinds of junk fees at airlines and banks, for example. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=944.0s)]
*  But for the most part, being real here, the rise in inflation was a result of external factors like the pandemic and the decisions of the Federal Reserve outside of President Biden's control. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=950.0s)]
*  And so voters might look at that and say, well, then why does it really matter who the next president is sort of coming down on its own? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=960.0s)]
*  It matters because Donald Trump is running on the most explicitly inflationary platform in modern history. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=967.0s)]
*  I think we should have a ring around the collar, as they say. I think when companies come in and they dump their products in the United States, they should pay automatically, let's say, a 10 percent tax. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=977.0s)]
*  I do like the 10 percent for everybody. Trump's proposal, a 10 percent across the board tariff on all foreign goods, would be basically a sales tax. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=988.0s)]
*  It would raise prices for American consumers. 10 percent on everything from avocados to iPhones. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=998.0s)]
*  Now, if you think that's bad today, behind closed doors, outside of the view of cameras, Donald Trump proposed one of the most deranged policies I have ever heard. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1003.0s)]
*  He told Republican lawmakers behind closed doors he wants to eliminate the income tax and replace it entirely with tariffs, effectively taking us back to the 19th century. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1015.0s)]
*  This idea makes as much sense as ripping up the entire interstate highway system and replacing it with canals. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1026.0s)]
*  Economist Paul Krugman did some back of the envelope math, estimates the policy quote would require an average tariff of 133 percent, not 10 percent. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1033.0s)]
*  That is a 133 percent tax hike on all imported goods. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1044.0s)]
*  That would be passed on to consumers, a sales tax of 133 percent. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1050.0s)]
*  It would cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1054.0s)]
*  Former senior policy adviser to the National Economic Council, Brendan Duke, explained further, quote, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1057.0s)]
*  Another way to put Trump's latest incredibly unworkable idea, one, get this, it would raise taxes by $5,000 for a typical family. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1063.0s)]
*  If you're a working person who buys stuff, it would cut taxes for the average family in the top point one percent by one point five million dollars. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1073.0s)]
*  This proposal would jack up everything everywhere for normal people, crushing the average American's wallet while giving the wealthiest folks who no longer have to pay an income tax and don't buy that much relative to their income in enormous windfall. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1082.0s)]
*  Millions and millions of dollars. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1099.0s)]
*  This is the man who was a 50-50 shot at taking the White House in large part because of the macroeconomic conditions that produced high inflation. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1100.0s)]
*  And he is seriously, quite seriously and earnestly currently running on the most insanely inflationary platform I've ever seen. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1108.0s)]
*  Higher prices, higher taxes for everyone. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1116.0s)]
*  It would make what we've seen over the last few years look like nothing. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1119.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn-3pgre7eY&t=1130.0s)]
