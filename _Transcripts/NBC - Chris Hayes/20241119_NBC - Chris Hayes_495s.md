# Marjorie Taylor Greene threatens GOP colleagues over Gaetz report: 'Let's all dance'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y)
*  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Even if Matt Gaetz was not investigated by the Department of Justice for the crime of sex trafficking a minor, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=2.24s)]
*  something he says he did not know, do, something he's never been charged for, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=8.72s)]
*  he still has no business being Attorney General. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  So let's just put all that aside for a moment, okay? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=16.56s)]
*  For all the talk of qualifications and merit, for all the railing against DEI and affirmative action, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=20.16s)]
*  Gaetz is the world's most ludicrous affirmative action pick ever. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=26.56s)]
*  In this case, affirmative action for Trump-toties and attention-addicted trolls. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  The former Florida congressman is technically a lawyer, but barely. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  He practiced law at a small firm for like a real minute until 2010 when he ran for office. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  And for context here, this was just two years after he passed the bar. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=47.04s)]
*  He has no experience at any level of trial courts, not as a public defender or a prosecutor. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=50.8s)]
*  He's got no experience working for the Department of Justice or any justice organization. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=58.16s)]
*  In fact, he even had his law license suspended a few years ago because he was not paying his fees. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=65.2s)]
*  At the time, his communications director said that is because [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=70.24s)]
*  Congressman Gaetz is no longer actively engaged in the practice of law. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=72.72s)]
*  It appears as though he does indeed have his license back, so kudos there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=76.96s)]
*  But that alone, I'm just going to go and say it, is not qualification to be [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=80.4s)]
*  the top law enforcement officer in the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=85.36s)]
*  So again, just starting there, manifestly unqualified, probably the most unqualified [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=88.72s)]
*  in the modern era. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=94.72s)]
*  But then, of course, there is the pesky fact of those allegations about his conduct with a minor. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=96.0s)]
*  Again, Gaetz says it's not true. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  We know the House Ethics Committee is sitting on what is apparently a pretty damning report [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=105.2s)]
*  into the matter. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=109.04s)]
*  One attorney told NBC News his client testified before that committee, again, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  a bipartisan ethics committee. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  This was not a liberal witch hunt, okay? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  A bipartisan, Republicans, Democrats getting together, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=118.72s)]
*  Testified before that committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a minor at a 2017 party. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=121.92s)]
*  What did your client witness at this party? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=132.08s)]
*  She was walking outside to the pool and she observed to a right, her friend, who was 17 at the time, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=133.44s)]
*  having sex with Representative Gaetz. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=139.04s)]
*  Did your client believe that Gaetz at the time knew that her friend was underage? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=140.48s)]
*  Yeah, so the House was curious about that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=146.88s)]
*  She testified that her belief was that Representative Gaetz had no knowledge that she was under 18, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=148.48s)]
*  that she was 17 years old at the time he was having sex with her. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  She also testified that when Representative Gaetz found out that she was underage, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=158.32s)]
*  they stopped their sexual relationship and did not resume it until after she turned 18. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=163.44s)]
*  Leppard says his clients, both the alleged witness and another woman, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=168.08s)]
*  testified Gaetz paid them repeatedly for sex and drugs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  The Washington Post also reports citing the same attorney. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  The women were paid through Venmo or other conduits, including the PayPal of, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=178.96s)]
*  who else? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=184.8s)]
*  Nestor Galban, whom Gaetz has referred to as his adopted son. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=185.52s)]
*  Now, when NBC News first reported this story last Friday, a Gaetz spokesperson noted, quote, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=190.56s)]
*  Merrick Garland's DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn't charge him. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=195.36s)]
*  But it's important to note that while Gaetz was not charged with DOJ, and that is true, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=198.56s)]
*  and that they did look into these charges, that's not the same thing as being cleared. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=201.84s)]
*  Now, despite all this, or really, who knows, maybe because of it, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is standing by his man. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, are you reconsidering the nomination of Matt Gaetz? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=214.56s)]
*  No. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  How far are you willing to go to get him confirmed? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the answer to our last question is he's willing to go pretty far. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=225.36s)]
*  Trump is even personally whipping votes behind the scenes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  For example, here's what Republican Senator Kevin Kramer of North Dakota said about Gaetz on Thursday. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=232.24s)]
*  Lots of votes, including mine. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=255.84s)]
*  Senator Kramer says Donald Trump called him after he made those comments to personally urge him [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  to support the man who the ethics committee had investigated for having sex with a minor. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  For what it's worth, Kramer says he is skeptical but open to the nomination. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=268.0s)]
*  Maybe we'll learn some new things about the circumstances [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  under which that investigation happened and the allegations at the center of it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=275.36s)]
*  I imagine we're going to hear a lot of language like that from Republican senators in the coming [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=281.12s)]
*  days and weeks. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=284.64s)]
*  Trump has also pushed some of that vote whipping work onto his second in command, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  the Financial Times reporting that JD Vance, a devout Catholic man of God, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  is set to act as something of a sherpa to guide Gaetz's expected nomination through the Senate, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  as well as that of Fox News Weekend host Pete Hegseth, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=300.64s)]
*  who Trump wants to return to the Defense Department. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a whole other story about Hegseth we won't get into now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=306.32s)]
*  Trump's co-president, Elon Musk, also helping out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=309.76s)]
*  He is out there comparing Gaetz favorably, I think, to Judge Dredd, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=312.8s)]
*  a fictional character from a comic book set in a future American dystopia [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  where democracy has been canceled and fascist so-called judges rule over the population [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=321.76s)]
*  and are permitted to act with near impunity as judge, jury, and executioner. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=326.8s)]
*  That's the model that Elon Musk says Gaetz embodies and why he should be head of the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=331.04s)]
*  Department of Justice. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=335.6s)]
*  So far it's unclear how effective this lobbying campaign has been. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=337.92s)]
*  Some senators have said they're reserving judgment. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=340.56s)]
*  They'd like to see the House Ethics Committee report into Gaetz. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=342.88s)]
*  That committee, the House Ethics Committee, is set to meet tomorrow to discuss how to move [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=346.32s)]
*  forward with that report, which again is, as far as we can see, completed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=350.32s)]
*  It's a question of whether it gets released and how. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=354.72s)]
*  Now, the probe was effectively shelved, or at least the release of the report was effectively shelved, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=356.64s)]
*  when Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress last week, which caught everyone by surprise. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=361.52s)]
*  Now, there's certainly a case, I think, humbly, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=366.16s)]
*  for the public to have access to the details in the report, nevertheless, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=368.64s)]
*  including the witnesses who say they saw Matt Gaetz having sex with a minor. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=372.64s)]
*  Just today we learned that an apparent hacker gained access to sworn testimony from two women [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=378.4s)]
*  involved in a related civil case. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  We should note the hacked material has not been made public, but it's another reminder [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=386.08s)]
*  this information still exists out there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  Some House Republicans really don't want that information to be made public. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=391.76s)]
*  I don't know why, but Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has even resorted [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=396.0s)]
*  to threatening members of her own party to that end, quote, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  For my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate, if we are going to release ethics reports [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=403.2s)]
*  and rip apart our own that Trump has appointed, then put it all out there for the American people [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=406.88s)]
*  to see. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=411.36s)]
*  Yes, all the ethics reports and claims, including the one I filed, all your sexual harassment and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=412.32s)]
*  assault claims that were secretly settled, paying off victims with taxpayer money. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  The entire Jeffrey Epstein files, tapes, recordings, witness interviews, but not just those, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=422.24s)]
*  there's more. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=426.88s)]
*  Epstein wasn't, isn't the only asset. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=427.52s)]
*  If we're going to dance, let's all dance in the sunlight. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=430.16s)]
*  I'll make sure we do. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=433.68s)]
*  Now, of course, there's some, well, grain of salt considered the source conspiratorial [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=435.92s)]
*  ruminations there. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=440.88s)]
*  But, you know, if there's a lot of this going around the Republican members of Congress, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=442.64s)]
*  I agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=446.72s)]
*  We should know about it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=448.56s)]
*  Now, the congresswoman provided no evidence such reports exist, but we do know that the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=450.4s)]
*  Gates Ethics Report exists. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=455.2s)]
*  We do know, according to a lawyer for some women, that they testified about what he did. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=456.88s)]
*  And if this man is going to not just have a job in the administration, run the Department of Justice, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=462.24s)]
*  I think the American public deserves to see it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJO7LYYY3Y&t=471.91999999999996s)]
