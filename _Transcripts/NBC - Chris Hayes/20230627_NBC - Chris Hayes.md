# Report Rudy Giuliani interviewed in DOJ probe into 2020 election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc)
*  Last summer, Cassie Hutchinson, former aide in the Trump White House, told the January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=0.0s)]
*  6 committee about that incident where Donald Trump wanted to join the rioters at the Capitol [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=4.7s)]
*  on January 6. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=9.32s)]
*  Hutchinson told the committee that the story was told to her by Tony Ornato, an agent who [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=10.32s)]
*  left the Secret Service to become Trump's deputy chief of staff. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=15.32s)]
*  This week, we've learned that about half a dozen Secret Service agents have testified [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=19.02s)]
*  before the grand jury investigating Trump's attempts to overturn the election. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=23.06s)]
*  We do not yet know if Ornato or Bobby Engel, who drove Trump that day, were among them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=27.56s)]
*  Special counsel Jack Smith is also investigating possible fraud by former Trump lawyers like [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani in their repeated false claims about the election, according to The Washington [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=37.62s)]
*  Post. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=41.96s)]
*  In fact, CNN reports tonight that Giuliani has been interviewed by federal investigators [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=42.96s)]
*  as part of the probe. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  Apparently, that interview happened in recent weeks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=49.32s)]
*  And in yet another sign, this investigation is in full swing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=52.22s)]
*  Tomorrow, federal investigators are scheduled to interview Georgia Secretary of State Brad [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=56.04s)]
*  Raftensberger, who got the infamous call from Trump asking for just 11,780 votes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Betsy Woodrow-Swan is a national correspondent at Politico, and she joins me now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=66.56s)]
*  Betsy, there's a lot to get to here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=71.44s)]
*  First, I would just say, as someone who's sort of reporting on the general investigation, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=74.52s)]
*  it does seem like there is more activity and more activity on the surface, and we're learning [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=80.44s)]
*  more and more of the key players than we have ever seen before from Jack Smith on the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=84.72s)]
*  January 6th part of the investigation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=89.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's no question. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=92.12s)]
*  There's just a massive amount of churn going on right now in terms of what Jack Smith is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=95.08s)]
*  up to. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=100.32s)]
*  The way that this looks to some people watching from the outside is that Smith is needing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=101.32s)]
*  to fill in certain gaps in his investigations, calling back in witnesses who've already been [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=106.66s)]
*  interviewed, interviewing witnesses who've already produced materials that were subpoenaed, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=112.28s)]
*  following up on outreaches that his team first made many, many months ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=118.0s)]
*  In the lead-up to the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation, there were a lot of folks in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=124.04s)]
*  sort of the witness lawyer community who started getting a little bit of a spidey sense about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=129.22s)]
*  an indictment coming, a little bit of a prickling on the back of an F. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=134.16s)]
*  I have yet to speak to people who have that very specific sense about a possible indictment [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=137.2s)]
*  being imminent when it comes to this January 6th investigative thread that Jack Smith is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  pulling, but there's no question that he's pulling it hard, and there's no question that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  just because the criminal proceedings in South Florida are getting really, really busy, that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=154.2s)]
*  does not appear whatsoever to be impeding this parallel work going on that's focused [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  on the date of January 6th and the days leading up to it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=165.6s)]
*  So there's a few main, what's striking to me is there's a bunch of parallel inquiries [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  that one would have around the entire scheme to overturn the election. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=175.98s)]
*  Raffensperger is someone that you would want to speak to, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=180.48s)]
*  He's talking to him tomorrow. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani, obviously someone you would have to speak to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  We find out just now that apparently he's talked to federal investigators. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=186.48s)]
*  So the sort of big names, but then there's also the fake electors and the fraud aspect [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  of this is from the Washington Post reporting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  The Justice Department's investigation of efforts by Donald Trump and his advisors to overturn [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=196.92s)]
*  the election. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=200.44s)]
*  Prosecutors focused on ads and fundraising pitches claiming election fraud as well as [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  plans for fake electors. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=206.84s)]
*  And in fact, we know about that immunity to two of them from Nevada. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=208.92s)]
*  That strikes me as significant. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=213.88s)]
*  It was also an area the January 6th committee focused on. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=214.88s)]
*  Yeah, and the fact that those two folks are from Nevada is particularly interesting. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=217.84s)]
*  Of all the different states where the alternate or fake electors scheme was ongoing, Nevada [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=222.82s)]
*  is important because the state legislature at the time, and I believe still, was controlled [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=228.18s)]
*  entirely by Democrats. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=232.82s)]
*  And some of these other states, including Georgia, some of these fake electors, the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=234.54s)]
*  day they signed the fake electoral ballots, said that they were acting under advice of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=238.62s)]
*  counsel that they were taking the steps they were taking because maybe the state legislatures [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  would do their thing and there would need to be this backup remedy available. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=248.26s)]
*  And that was something that some of those fake electors got lawyers to tell them to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=252.74s)]
*  do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=256.38s)]
*  But in Nevada, that explanation, of course, wouldn't hold water and wouldn't be relevant [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=257.38s)]
*  at all because there was a 0% chance that the Democratic controlled legislature in Nevada [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=261.5s)]
*  was going to throw out the law of electoral votes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=267.74s)]
*  So the fact that Jack Smith's team, at least from where we sit, seems to be particularly [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=270.82s)]
*  leaning into the Nevada piece of this is uniquely interesting. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=276.18s)]
*  The fact that it's taken him so long to talk to Brad Brafensberger is also interesting. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=280.8s)]
*  Of course, everyone watching this show knows Bonnie Willis, the district attorney in Georgia, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  is working on a fast moving case, looking specifically at the Georgia piece of this [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=290.8s)]
*  probe. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=295.44s)]
*  We also know DOJ doesn't like necessarily getting involved in redundant ways with state [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=296.44s)]
*  and local criminal proceedings. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=303.14s)]
*  So the fact that there's been this action in Nevada, I think is particularly interesting. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=305.2s)]
*  I think it's a state that people should be keeping an eye on as they're tracking the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=309.96s)]
*  it feels like as they're tracking the zillions of threads that Jack Smith and his team are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  pulling right now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=318.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really, really great point. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=319.2s)]
*  I hadn't even put that two and two together until you just said it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=320.52s)]
*  Betsy Woodruff-Swan, that's why we have you on. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=323.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCrr062egQc&t=325.71999999999997s)]
