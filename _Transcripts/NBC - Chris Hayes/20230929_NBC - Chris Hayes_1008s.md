# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 28
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q)
*  As it has been established multiple times, there was no definitive first-hand evidence presented [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=0.0s)]
*  at the impeachment hearing. No new facts were introduced that weren't already entered into the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=4.88s)]
*  record. That did not stop the theatrics and the Republicans, and it did not stop members of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=8.8s)]
*  committee from pretending they had evidence like that. Most notably, Florida Congressman Byron [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=12.72s)]
*  Donaldson. Next slide, please. For my colleagues on the other side, we're going to start talking [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  evidence now. Oh, this is a fun one. Ladies and gentlemen, this one is from 2018. This is about [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=23.44s)]
*  four months before Joe Biden launched his campaign for president of the United States, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=29.52s)]
*  December 2018. The highlight is this is a text message between Jim Biden and Hunter Biden. Hunter [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=33.76s)]
*  Biden was in a bad way, by the way. He was really strung out. He lost a bunch of money. He needed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=40.56s)]
*  help. Jim Biden says, this can work. You need a safe harbor. I can work with your father alone. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=46.0s)]
*  It'll probably take several months and everybody can read the text. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=54.72s)]
*  Now, again, none of that's actual evidence of an impeachable offense by President Joe Biden, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  but the real issue with that presentation is the congressman from Florida apparently brought in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=62.48s)]
*  fabricated Photoshop slides of text messages as his supposed evidence, which eliminated the actual [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=67.12s)]
*  context and was incredibly deceptive. And he was subsequently called out on it in the hearing by [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=73.28s)]
*  his colleague, New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=79.68s)]
*  Earlier today, one of our colleagues, a gentleman from Florida, presented up on this screen [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=84.24s)]
*  something that looked, appeared to be a screenshot of a text message containing or [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=91.36s)]
*  insinuating an explosive allegation. That screenshot of what appeared to be a text message [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=97.28s)]
*  was a fabricated image. It was a fabricated image. I don't know where it came from. I don't know if [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  it was the staff of the committee, but it was not the actual direct screenshot from that phone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=113.92s)]
*  And in fact, I would like to submit to the committee the actual full context [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  from the Ziegler affidavit number one, exhibit 402, of the full text of that exchange. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=127.68s)]
*  Do I have permission from the chair? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=136.24s)]
*  The chair. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=137.44s)]
*  Importantly, what was brought out from that fabricated image excluded critical context [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=139.92s)]
*  that changed the underlying meaning and allegation that was presented up on that screen [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=147.84s)]
*  by this committee and by members of this committee. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=154.72s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the number two Democrat on the Oversight [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=159.68s)]
*  Committee and she joins me now. It's good to have you there, congresswoman. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=163.84s)]
*  This was one, this was a really striking moment. There was a much larger part of the text that sort [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=168.16s)]
*  of altered what that conversation about getting a job was really about. How did you catch that and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=174.0s)]
*  what does it say that that's the evidence they're using in this, their first impeachment inquiry? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=180.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I think this just speaks to the tremendous amount of teamwork that we've [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=188.0s)]
*  been able to accomplish on the House Oversight Committee. Of course, it's an honor to be the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=192.24s)]
*  vice ranking member under Congressman Jamie Raskin, who we just heard from. And I think the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=196.96s)]
*  leadership and the collaboration in that committee and also the depth and dedication of work, people [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=201.28s)]
*  have been pouring over these documents, at least those documents that House Republicans are even [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=206.4s)]
*  divulging before and sharing with the public before the hearing. But, you know, I think immediately [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  when this screenshot was raised, first, this was not something that had been seen before, but [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=218.0s)]
*  vaguely had seemed familiar. I think we had our committee staff really tearing through every [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=224.56s)]
*  possible document to try to piece together how this possibly even came to be. And I think [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=230.08s)]
*  we were finally able to match up in real time what the actual context was as opposed to what [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=234.96s)]
*  Congressman Byron Donalds chose to put on that screen. And it really cannot be understated how [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=243.84s)]
*  deceptive that was to take critical messages out of context, to tear apart the context that they're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  in, and then to Photoshop a text message bubble to make it look like it's reconstructed back on a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=260.56s)]
*  phone. And this is supposed to be the Republican case for impeachment? I mean, at this point, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=268.16s)]
*  we should be investigating the investigation for the ethical conduct that is happening [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  on the Republican side of the aisle. And I think, frankly, they knew, the Republican party knew, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  that this was cooked and done from the beginning. Their star witnesses that they called in today [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  said in their opening statements that there is not evidence to support articles of impeachment [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=296.32s)]
*  against the president of the United States. And so this was done from the start. I am quite not [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=303.44s)]
*  really sure why they decided to embarrass themselves in this manner today, but it was [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=308.8s)]
*  evident you could feel it. It was palpable in the hearing room. You saw Byron Donalds there [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  in that split screen. He himself was embarrassed slouching in his chair. I don't know what was [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=320.24s)]
*  quite going through their minds. Yeah, the ranking member, Jamie Raskin, just said that they were [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=326.08s)]
*  leaving the committee room. I mean, this was their big show, right? This was the big set piece. This [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=333.52s)]
*  was the unveiling of the thing that they have been building up to since they took the House, honestly, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=338.64s)]
*  and it seemed like they didn't even really have the heart to see it through during the actual [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=342.96s)]
*  hearing today. Yes, and it's important to also underscore the significance of leaving the hearing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=346.88s)]
*  room in such a consequential hearing. For example, when we had our questioning of Michael Cohen or [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=353.76s)]
*  other very high profile witnesses, it is very well understood that in such a consequential hearing, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=359.28s)]
*  your opposition is going to use every point of leverage possible and you have to stay in those [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=365.68s)]
*  seats because in procedural votes, for example, we try to vote on issuing subpoenas to actual [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=372.8s)]
*  first-hand witnesses like Lev Parnas or Rudy Giuliani into the kind of odd progeny of where [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=380.32s)]
*  this story even began in the first place. And we were winning those votes. They had to scramble [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=386.4s)]
*  and call back members and delay. And so you really, in consequential hearings, it is hearing 101 that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=392.96s)]
*  all members need to be in their seats to prepare for any affront from the opposition. That's a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=400.96s)]
*  really interesting point, and they still didn't, they couldn't, I mean, which sort of segues to the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=406.32s)]
*  larger breakdown of discipline here that's happening in the entire House. We're here two [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=411.44s)]
*  days away from a shutdown. I mean, I think, again, it's unclear what they really want, but, you know, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=414.96s)]
*  they're floating these insane cuts to Title I, which is the huge federal education program for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=419.52s)]
*  low-income districts, cuts to WIC, which is for women with infant children. There's a bunch of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=424.8s)]
*  people who aren't going to get paid. I don't really know if they know what their demands are. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=431.76s)]
*  It's these big spending cuts, but even those, they can't quite stomach. What is, do you have [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=435.68s)]
*  an understanding of what the ask here is, I guess? I think there's an enormous amount of speculation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=439.92s)]
*  as to the motives of this Republican infighting. And as you said, the stakes are very, very high. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=447.68s)]
*  And for some folks that might say, oh, these federal employees may be getting back pay. Many [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  will, but there are many people who are working who will not get back pay, including employees [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  of federal contractors. Even in the House Capitol itself, the cafeteria workers are contract workers. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=463.44s)]
*  And these workers are terrified because they may not get back pay. And these are some of the most [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=472.08s)]
*  vulnerable workers that we see. You're making just a couple bucks an hour. You cannot afford to miss [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=478.24s)]
*  a paycheck, let alone get one late, let alone not have it repaid. And so they are literally, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=484.64s)]
*  the Republican Party is literally biting the hands that feed them here in the United States [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=490.96s)]
*  Capitol by playing games with a looming government shutdown. And ironically, many of the members that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=496.08s)]
*  were wasting time in that impeachment hearing today are the same members that are holding up [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  the votes necessary for us to pass a clean resolution to fund the government while folks [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=507.84s)]
*  settle out their differences. So as to their end game, I think, frankly, some of them just want to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=513.68s)]
*  file a motion to vacate against Speaker McCarthy. And they think that if you shut down a government, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=520.4s)]
*  create a crisis, then you can try to file a motion to vacate their own Speaker of the House, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=525.6s)]
*  Republican Speaker of the House. But beyond that, it's very difficult to try to understand what the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  end game here is. Congressman Jamie Raskin is a Democrat of Maryland. He serves as a ranking [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  member on the Oversight Committee, and he joins me now. Congressman Raskin, I guess, first, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=544.24s)]
*  your impressions of how things went today. It was a meltdown for the Republicans, obviously. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=549.68s)]
*  They advertised to the world that they literally have no facts and no evidence that would justify [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=556.88s)]
*  impeaching President Biden for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. And their [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=563.3599999999999s)]
*  own expert witnesses attested to that fact as well. And I think that was the part that shocked them, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=569.04s)]
*  that we were able to get their witnesses to say that there was not remotely a sufficient quantum [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=574.8s)]
*  of evidence that would justify impeaching President Biden. And meantime, we are careening [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=581.04s)]
*  towards a terrible government shutdown that will spread massive pain and hardship and anxiety [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=587.52s)]
*  throughout the entire country. One of the things you might notice if you were watching the hearing, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  Chris, is that all the Democrats were there for the vast majority of the hearing and the Republicans [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=600.96s)]
*  began to decamp very quickly and it was pretty much empty over on their side of the aisle for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=607.6s)]
*  long periods, for big stretches of it. So, Donald Trump... Let me ask you... Wait, I want to stop [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=614.4000000000001s)]
*  you right there. Why? Why did that happen? I think they were embarrassed by what was going on. I mean, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=620.48s)]
*  their witnesses defected from their side and essentially were saying that there was not [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=627.6s)]
*  sufficient evidence for impeachment. The impeachment inquiry also was never voted on by the House of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=634.72s)]
*  Representatives, which was something that Kevin McCarthy said he would do. And it was also something [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=643.04s)]
*  that he demanded the Democrats do, which we did do with the impeachment of Donald Trump. And they [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=647.68s)]
*  ended up getting an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel and the Department of Justice saying [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=654.16s)]
*  that there needs to be a vote on the floor in order to give the additional powers to a committee to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=659.28s)]
*  engage in impeachment. And that delegation needed to be done. But they didn't do that here. Why? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=664.8s)]
*  Because they are at least 15 or 20 votes down on the Republican side. You have people like Ken Buck, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=670.16s)]
*  who's a Freedom Caucus member on the Judiciary Committee, a former chief of the criminal division [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Colorado, who just says the whole thing makes no sense. They just [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=681.52s)]
*  don't have any evidence on Donald Trump. And so Kevin McCarthy obviously was trying to placate [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=686.4s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert and Matt Gaetz and others doing Donald Trump's bidding, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=693.12s)]
*  who wanted to impeach Biden. So he said, oh, sure, just go ahead and do it. But he was very cavalier [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=698.96s)]
*  with the Constitution of the United States, and it boomeranged on them and blew up in their face. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=705.36s)]
*  Yeah, that last point you make, it's always been sort of clear that at a political level, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=709.68s)]
*  just in terms of internal caucus faction management, McCarthy has viewed these things as related, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=714.16s)]
*  right? He needs votes to keep the government open. The sop I'll give you is we'll start an [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=720.4799999999999s)]
*  impeachment inquiry. But even as soon as he announced that, those same people he was trying [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=725.76s)]
*  to suck up to to win their votes on were like, no, not good. They didn't go for it out the door. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=730.4s)]
*  But now the thing is, they got to do it because they've announced it. I mean, it was just so [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=736.08s)]
*  evident to me that this was they were going forward with it because they said they were. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=739.12s)]
*  They had hoped they would find some smoking government evidence or any evidence at all. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=744.24s)]
*  They don't have it, but they got to do it anyway. Well, you can't appease Matt Gaetz and Marjorie [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  Taylor Greene and ultimately Donald Trump. I mean, that is a rule or ruin faction which literally [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  wants to control the entire government of the United States in their own interests. And they're [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=760.24s)]
*  willing to enthrone minority rule against the will of the vast majority of American people. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=765.2s)]
*  They're willing to take away abortion rights from women. They're willing to take WIC funds away and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=770.96s)]
*  they're willing to take SNAP funds away from hungry people. They're willing to shut down the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=778.24s)]
*  government of the United States simply because Donald Trump thinks that will shut down his [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=783.12s)]
*  criminal prosecutions, even though in the last Republican shutdown, criminal cases went forward [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=786.96s)]
*  in the federal judiciary, which is what I'm trying to explain to them. But [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=792.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is convinced if you shut down the government, he'll be able to delay his cases [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=796.16s)]
*  and then maybe get to the election without having to face a jury of his peers. And if he can, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=800.64s)]
*  you know, just flip seven million people who voted for Joe Biden over to Donald Trump and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=805.52s)]
*  get millions of young people who hate everything he stands for to vote for him, then he'll be back [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=810.4s)]
*  in office and he can grant himself and all the insurrectionists a pardon. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=815.36s)]
*  They I don't I pay attention to this for a living and I've tried to follow the bouncing [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=819.9200000000001s)]
*  ball here on what actually is going to go on with this shutdown. But I'm but I'm really confused at [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  this point. I had a thread. I sort of lost it. Does that what's going on? Like it seems like [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=829.44s)]
*  they're on an impasse. He's not he can't whip the votes to pass it with Republicans. That that seems [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=836.0s)]
*  clear and he's not going to get them. So then what? So it's utterly dysfunctional within the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=841.12s)]
*  Republican caucus because he can't tame the rampaging mega faction. So there would be a [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=847.76s)]
*  very simple solution if he had simply the courage to exercise it, which is to have the House [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=854.0s)]
*  Republicans put on the floor the clean continuing resolution with the Ukraine aid, with the disaster [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=860.64s)]
*  aid that passed overwhelmingly across the hall in the state Senate with the vast majority, not [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=867.04s)]
*  just of Democrats, but of Republicans, and put it on the floor. So in other words, it would align [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=872.64s)]
*  most of the House Republicans with the Senate Republicans, the Senate Democrats, all of the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  House Democrats and the president of the United States. But he won't do it because they're [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=882.88s)]
*  threatening to quote vacate the chair, which means to topple Kevin McCarthy. So it means more to him [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=887.12s)]
*  to stay in office than to keep the government in the United States going. But if I were Kevin [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=893.5999999999999s)]
*  McCarthy, I would tell him if he's watching MSNBC right now, go ahead and do the right thing, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=898.0s)]
*  put it on the floor, let us all vote on it. And if they try to topple your speakership, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=903.2s)]
*  see who they've got against you, see who they can put up against you. I don't think [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=908.72s)]
*  Matt Gaetz can beat him. I don't think George Santos can beat him. I don't know. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=912.32s)]
*  Call the bluff. Right. Just to be clear here, there's already a continuing resolution. It [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=916.08s)]
*  keeps the government funded. It has aid for Ukraine and disaster relief. It's passed on a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  bipartisan basis, huge majorities out of the Senate. Right. That language exists. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=923.5200000000001s)]
*  Bring it over from one side of the Capitol, the other call the vote on it for a floor. It'll pass [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=930.4s)]
*  with what? 350 votes, probably somewhere in that, you know, that I'm 535, maybe, maybe even 400. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=935.28s)]
*  And then you're done. And then if they come for you, they can come for you. But, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=944.16s)]
*  but he doesn't want that. Well, look what they did in the rules committee this afternoon, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=947.76s)]
*  while we were in the so-called impeachment hearing, they dismembered the legislation that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=953.76s)]
*  came over from the Senate. As I understand it, they removed the aid to the people of Ukraine, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=960.48s)]
*  resisting Putin's filthy invasion and the kidnapping and the rape and the military attack [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=966.72s)]
*  on the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine to make that a separate bill to try to make it more [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=973.44s)]
*  palatable to the authoritarian mega faction. So maybe they would vote for that part of the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=978.48s)]
*  continuing resolution that does not include solidarity for the people of Ukraine. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxXT51H00Q&t=983.84s)]
