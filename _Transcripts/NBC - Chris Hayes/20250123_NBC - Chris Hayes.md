# ‘Boggles my mind’: Judge eviscerates Trump executive order after blocking it
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso)
*  Today we got the first federal temporary block of a Donald Trump executive order, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=0.0s)]
*  the one that has seen the most legally and constitutionally dubious, the one that purports [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  to just end birthright citizenship at the stroke of a pen. At the hearing in Seattle, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=8.48s)]
*  the federal judge appointed by Ronald Reagan, he's been on the bench for a while, needed only [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=13.92s)]
*  25 minutes before he was ready to issue the order saying, quote, I've been on the bench for over four [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=18.64s)]
*  decades. I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=24.0s)]
*  This is a blatantly unconstitutional order. That is because birthright citizenship is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=30.64s)]
*  literally in the very first sentence of the 14th Amendment, written during Reconstruction, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=38.08s)]
*  guaranteeing that people born or naturalized in the United States are United States citizens. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=43.6s)]
*  Sherilyn Ifill holds the Vernon Jordan Chair in Civil Rights at Howard University, where she is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  launching the 14th Amendment Center for Law and Democracy. She was previously the President and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=52.56s)]
*  Director of Council for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and she joins me now. I don't think the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=57.68s)]
*  judge's order was wholly unexpected today because of the egregiousness of the executive order, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=64.48s)]
*  and yet you never know these days your reaction to what the judge had to say and the fact that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  they have in fact halted. Good evening, Chris. Thanks so much for having me on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=75.76s)]
*  First and foremost, the people challenging Trump's executive order are on the offensive, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  which means they get to pick the place where they filed the case. This did not end up in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=88.32s)]
*  Judge Kazmarek's court or Eileen Cannon's court. Instead, the plaintiffs obviously chose places [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=93.6s)]
*  where they believed they could get a fair hearing. It is a no-brainer, Chris, of course, that an [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=100.08s)]
*  executive order cannot overturn a provision of our Constitution. Forget about what the provision [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=107.36s)]
*  says. Let's leave out birthright citizenship for the moment. There's just an imbalance here, right, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=113.36s)]
*  that the Constitution is our founding document and its provisions cannot be overturned by an [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=119.44s)]
*  executive order. So a president can no better declare that there will no longer be a First [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=125.12s)]
*  Amendment or that the First Amendment will only extend to actual citizens of the country or [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=131.52s)]
*  people who have been here for a certain number of years simply cannot be done just as a matter of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=137.28s)]
*  symmetry of power. And I think that's what the judge was referring to when he said, you know, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=142.32s)]
*  he can't imagine a more egregiously kind of unconstitutional proposal because that symmetry [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=148.32s)]
*  is there. That being said, obviously Trump has talked about this for a long time. He ran on the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=154.96s)]
*  idea of getting rid of birthright citizenship. And for years I've been saying that the Republicans [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=160.4s)]
*  have almost talked themselves into the fever dream. We've heard it from Lindsey Graham and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=164.8s)]
*  other senators who've constantly said we have to overturn birthright citizenship. And I've always [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  said, okay, great, are you calling a constitutional convention? Are you planning to amend the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Constitution? Right. But they have talked about it as though birthright citizenship is a policy [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  choice. And it is not a policy choice. It is a constitutional imperative. It is the first line [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=183.84s)]
*  of the 14th Amendment of our Constitution. It was created to ensure that black people, both free [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=189.84s)]
*  and formerly enslaved, would be citizens and that all who are born in this country or naturalized [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  are citizens of this country. And that cannot be overturned by executive order. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=202.0s)]
*  I thought what the judge had to say, and this was interesting because something you've spoken a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=207.6s)]
*  bit about is the sort of responsibilities of members of the bar and legal ethics. And, you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=211.12s)]
*  and the judge said something pretty spicy about this. He said, frankly, I have difficulty [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  It just boggles the mind. Coming close to saying that you're sort of flirting with a violation of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=231.52s)]
*  your oath by even coming into my court with this. Well, I thought that was interesting as well, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=236.8s)]
*  Chris. Of course, as lawyers, we are permitted to push against laws that we believe are [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=243.04s)]
*  unconstitutional or seek to change the law. But you do have to have a well-founded argument, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=249.76s)]
*  right? Because you don't just get to walk up into court and say anything you want to. You actually [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=255.76s)]
*  have to follow the law, which is the whole point of being a lawyer. But if you are challenging what [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=259.84s)]
*  you believe is an unjust law or challenging the interpretation of a law, you have to have a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=263.92s)]
*  well-founded basis for it. And there are, if you look at the advisory committee notes regarding [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=267.84s)]
*  filing complaints, Rule 26, there are some things that they suggest you might want to have in your [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=273.44s)]
*  pocket as a way of showing that you have a well-founded basis for seeking to overturn [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=278.88s)]
*  that law or to challenge the interpretation of the law. This is early days yet. This was just, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=285.12s)]
*  you know, a very early motion. And so we haven't seen all the things that the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=289.84s)]
*  now Justice Department will be claiming justify this new interpretation, justify the Supreme [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  Court jettisoning its 100 years of interpretation. But I think the judge's question was a shot across [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=302.88s)]
*  the bow to lawyers to say, you better come with it and not just a Sally Forth into this court and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  waste our time. Another provision of the 14th Amendment is a provision that explicitly [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  contemplates insurrectionists and what to do with people that were guilty of it, including [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=319.12s)]
*  barring them from office. And the pardoning of insurrectionists was actually an enormous [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  question before the country back in the wake of the Civil War and Reconstruction. We saw [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=333.12s)]
*  enormous mass pardoning of insurrectionists, I think it's fair to say, including people convicted [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=338.0s)]
*  the most serious of these seditious conspiracy yesterday, two days ago. I want to just play for [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=342.56s)]
*  you what what Officer Michael Fanon, of course, who was beaten on the steps of the Capitol had [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  to say tonight to my colleague, Joy Reid, about those pardons. Take a listen. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=354.0s)]
*  This is part of his plan. The plan is to pardon those that committed crimes on his behalf [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=359.36s)]
*  because he knows that that will send a message to the citizens of this country. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  If you commit crimes on my behalf, I support you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=370.24s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=376.0s)]
*  I thought it was incredibly powerful. And you'll remember, Chris, we can take this all the way back [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=378.4s)]
*  to 2015 during Trump's original campaign when he said at his rallies, you know, punch him out, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  right, to people who are protesting, punch him out, and I'll take care of your representation, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=390.96s)]
*  right? I'll pay for your lawyers. You know, this is something Trump has done, and it is because [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=397.28s)]
*  he wants to know that he has a kind of army, a kind of group of brownshirts who will support him, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=403.52s)]
*  who will show fealty to him and show fealty to him to the point of violence. And I think that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=410.08s)]
*  Michael Fanon is correct, and it is incredibly frightening, but I think that is true. And [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=418.24s)]
*  and this is an important moment, I think, that we should not let go pass very quickly the pardoning [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=426.08s)]
*  of all of the January 6th convicts, particularly those who assaulted police officers. We have been [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=434.08s)]
*  browbeaten by the Republican Party for years who have set police officers above the law, who have [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  said we cannot question their conduct, who have said they are heroes, who have said we cannot come [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=446.24s)]
*  against them and to do so is somehow unpatriotic. And here we have a president pardoning people who [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=452.08s)]
*  assaulted, beat, harmed, and committed acts that resulted in the death of police officers trying [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=457.52s)]
*  to protect the Capitol. We should never let Trump forget that. And I think he knows that this story [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=464.0s)]
*  is dangerous to him, and that is why you may have seen, Chris, yesterday this plan to create their [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=470.56s)]
*  own January 6th committee. So the pardons aren't enough. He has to also try to recreate the narrative. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=476.56s)]
*  He has to try to lost cause January 6th and suggest that what we saw with our own eyes was not true. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=483.2s)]
*  So it's very, very serious indeed. Yeah, an interesting historical note that we should just [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=491.12s)]
*  bring up is that much of the worst violence in the reign of terror in the South after Reconstruction [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=496.88s)]
*  was committed by insurrectionists, by people who had taken up arms against the U.S. government, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=502.16s)]
*  were never punished or held to account, and then they did other things as well. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=506.48s)]
*  Sherrilyn Eifel, thank you very much. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuW2Qerrfso&t=509.6s)]
