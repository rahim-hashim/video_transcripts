# How Trump compels GOP lawmakers to ‘bend the knee’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8)
*  You've probably heard the phrase bend the knee long predates HBO's Game of Thrones [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=0.0s)]
*  But it was often used on that show when a monarchial figure managed to impose their will on a subjugated populace [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=4.68s)]
*  Reinforcing that this new person was fully in charge. I [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=11.16s)]
*  Offer you a choice [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=15.84s)]
*  Bend the knee and join me [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=18.12s)]
*  Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it or refuse and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=20.52s)]
*  die [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=27.68s)]
*  I [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=30.0s)]
*  That brutal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=50.56s)]
*  Pre-democratic vision of governance through force is I think one of the few sincere beliefs that's held by the ex-president [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=53.08s)]
*  Donald Trump underscores it all the time when he congratulates Kim Jong-un or Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  He has conducted himself in that fashion nowhere more so than within the Republican Party [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  where he views himself as a king to whom everyone must pledge loyalty and amazingly it has worked as [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=69.84s)]
*  Documented in new reporting from the New York Times quote in October [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=76.0s)]
*  Trump sunk a top candidate for speaker Tom Emmer by posting that voting for him would be a tragic mistake on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=79.0s)]
*  Wednesday emmer capitulated and endorsed him they always bend the knee Trump said privately of Emmer's endorsement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=85.16s)]
*  Timmy the Snyder is a professor of history at Yale University an expert on the history of fascism author of on [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=91.8s)]
*  tyranny 20 lessons from the 20th century and he joins me now um I [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=97.76s)]
*  Guess one of the things that I've been thinking about with this story is there's some line of like normal rough-and-tumble [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=103.28s)]
*  democratic politics [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=109.16s)]
*  Which is like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=110.2s)]
*  Cajoling people to get endorsements and maybe even kind of threatening them [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=111.76s)]
*  I'm gonna you know I'm gonna come after you in the press if you don't and and then there's the vision of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=114.92s)]
*  loyalty in a in a sort of autocratic way and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=120.8s)]
*  What makes him on the other side of that line in your mind? I? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=124.92s)]
*  Think because first of all it's all [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Personal there's never any loyalty to the law or to institutions or to the Constitution or to the government or to the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=133.08s)]
*  Country it's all personal and that's that's where the the line is sure a normal democratic politician will trade favors [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=140.2s)]
*  We'll want this for that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  But there's usually some some sense of operating within the rules for mr. Trump there aren't rules [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=149.2s)]
*  There's just the idea of him as a person [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  There's also the aspect and I don't think this is the case in like Tom emmer's case that he was worried about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=158.92s)]
*  Physical violence or threats, but it is the case clearly and you see it in the discourse [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=164.72s)]
*  And you've commented on this a little bit even about how people react to the section [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=168.52s)]
*  three of the 14th Amendment ruling that if you go along with this there will be violence and we know firsthand from a number of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=173.96s)]
*  different accounts including [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=180.28s)]
*  McKay Coppins biography of Mitt Romney and other former members of Congress that people have made [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=181.84s)]
*  Calculations about how they will politically [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=187.92s)]
*  Relate to Donald Trump based sheer sure purely on fear and fear of threats for them and their family [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=191.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's the thing like mr. It's there's no dragon, right? I mean he's not physically fearful [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=197.72s)]
*  You know what the only source of fear is what he's gonna say about you on social media [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=203.84s)]
*  And then how other people might react to that so there's a pretty profound cowardice inside his own [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=208.16s)]
*  Threats he's not actually facing anybody [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=215.12s)]
*  Directly what you say about the Supreme Court is really important [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=218.04s)]
*  If we exist at all we exist as a nation under law and the Supreme Court has the Constitution in which the very clear [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=221.32s)]
*  very clear wording of section 3 of the 14th Amendment makes it clear that an [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=229.76s)]
*  Insurrectionist like mr. Trump or like a number of other people [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=233.36s)]
*  Can't hold the presidency or for that matter any other state or federal office and yet we find a lot of people saying well [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  You know [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=242.6s)]
*  We're kind of afraid of what his supporters might do if we enforced the law of the land [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=243.16s)]
*  And if once you take that step once you preemptively [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  Concede that you don't really believe in the law because you're afraid of a threat that hasn't even been made [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=251.76s)]
*  Then you're you know, then you're taking part in undoing the Republic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  There was another story today that that struck me about this sort of you know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=260.8s)]
*  cult of personality or sort of this sort of you know king like view of loyalty, right which to me is just fundamentally [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=265.32s)]
*  deeply [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=272.36s)]
*  Democratic in its ethos at least Stefanic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=273.44s)]
*  Withdrew her endorsement of a Republican candidate in Ohio [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=276.76s)]
*  Who mildly criticized Trump? This is what the Craig Rydell said. He said I think he's arrogant [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=280.88s)]
*  I don't like the way he calls people names. I just don't think that's very becoming of a president [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=286.48s)]
*  He said in an audio recording [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=290.08s)]
*  Stefanic [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=291.88s)]
*  Said this earlier this week. I informed Craig Rydell that I will be withdrawing my endorsement [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=293.2s)]
*  I was very disappointed in his inappropriate comments regarding President Trump as we begin 2024 [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=297.56s)]
*  My focus is on ensuring we nominate the strongest candidates in the ballot who are committed to electing President Trump this November and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=302.76s)]
*  Expanding our house GOP majority. What do you think of that? I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=308.36s)]
*  Think it's striking that anyone would think that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=312.64s)]
*  Appropriate and inappropriate are the criteria that one would apply to to Donald Trump, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean that the the way she's using the word inappropriate is we must simply follow along with whatever the man says [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=321.34s)]
*  And we must simply you know, we must simply anticipate his every need and do what that is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  That's a standard of appropriateness and then appropriateness which has nothing to do with policy or with the law or what's or what's good for the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=333.68s)]
*  Country just has to do with the whims of someone who you regard as a leader and for me like that's that's the distinction going back [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=340.44s)]
*  To your earlier question. He's not he's not meant to be a candidate or a president or an executive officer [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  You know from this point of view, he's a leader with a capital L. He's just a person. He's not somebody who holds an office [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  Timothy Snyder as always. Thank you, sir [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVj7LuVLuq8&t=358.6s)]
