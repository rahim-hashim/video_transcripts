# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Aug. 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0)
*  But first today in a pair of newly public documents, we've learned brand new details about both [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and his lawyers attempts to overturn American democracy and the special counsel's attempt to hold him accountable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=5.7s)]
*  The first document we learned about is yet another coup memo [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=12.88s)]
*  dated exactly one month before January 6. It is authored by Trump election lawyer Ken Chisbro, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=17.28s)]
*  believed to be one of the unindicted co-conspirators mentioned in the Jack Smith indictment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=23.82s)]
*  And it expands on the so-called fake elector scheme and the efforts to pressure Mike Pence to hand the election to Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  Quote, I believe that what can be achieved on January 6 is not simply to keep Biden below [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=35.32s)]
*  270 electoral votes. It seems feasible. The vote count can be conducted [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=42.28s)]
*  so that at no point will Trump be behind in the electoral vote count unless and until [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Biden can obtain a favorable decision from the Supreme Court. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=54.56s)]
*  In other words, a scheme to declare Trump the winner over the will of the people and to force Biden to try to claw back [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=59.24s)]
*  his legitimate small-d Democratic victory via the 6-3 Trump Supreme Court. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=65.64s)]
*  So that's one document we got today, but it's not all we learned today because we also got a newly unsealed legal filing from the January 6 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=72.08000000000001s)]
*  case, revealing that the special counsel [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  successfully gained access to the ex-president's Twitter account earlier this year, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=82.52s)]
*  but not without a fight from the company's new right-wing owner, Elon Musk. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=87.08s)]
*  Back in May, it was first reported that Smith's team was feuding with a major tech company in some capacity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  The details of the fight were unclear based on the available court records at the time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=96.8s)]
*  So now we know precisely what went down, at least part of it. As part of his investigation, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=100.96s)]
*  Smith deemed it necessary to view the inner workings of Trump's Twitter account, although it's not currently clear what exactly he was looking for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=106.8s)]
*  per the legal filing. Quote, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=114.64s)]
*  Based on affidavits, the district court found probable cause to search the Twitter account for evidence of criminal offenses. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=128.84s)]
*  In other words, Smith was able to convince a judge that there was reason to believe Donald Trump's Twitter account contained evidence of crime, probable cause, constitutional standard. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=135.56s)]
*  Now, at the time, Twitter was newly in the hands of that gentleman there, you probably know him, Elon Musk, who was very busy building a public image as a right-wing troll. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=143.68s)]
*  And the company was operating in such a state of manifest dysfunction, Smith's prosecutors could not even get through to them initially. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  I quote again, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so Smith finally gets through to Twitter on the 19th, the deadline to comply with the warrants is the 27th, about a week later. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's see how that went. Quote, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=187.76s)]
*  Two days before the deadline, Twitter's lawyer says she had no idea there was even a warrant from the Department of Justice in the first place. At this point, not only was Musk running Twitter in his total state of chaos, according to all public accounts we have, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=201.16s)]
*  it was clear that he would stop at nothing to court controversy and attention for his $44 billion vanity purchase, which was very quickly losing value. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=214.4s)]
*  After all, he was already using the platform to spread misinformation, to platform neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and as he told CNBC, nothing, nothing could stop him from keeping things as chaotic as possible. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  Do your tweets hurt the company? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=235.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's a scene in The Princess Bride, great movie, where he confronts the person who killed his father, and he says, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=237.4s)]
*  Offer me money, offer me power, I don't care. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=254.28s)]
*  So you just don't care? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=261.24s)]
*  I'll say what I want to say, and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=263.04s)]
*  Okay, that last part is going to be important in just a second. So here's the crucial part of this whole ordeal. Smith's prosecutors had to take steps to ensure that Musk would not spill the beans about the search warrant. Quote, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=268.6s)]
*  Put more simply, later in the filing, quote, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=292.24s)]
*  Now Musk was apparently not happy he couldn't tell Trump about the search warrant. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=311.92s)]
*  Four days after the initial deadline, he challenged the entire process, four days after the deadline, he challenged, okay, on the grounds he had a free speech right to spill the beans regarding this ongoing criminal investigation of the ex-President of the United States. Quote, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  In its motion challenging the non-disclosure order, Twitter argued that the order violated the company's First Amendment right to communicate with its subscriber, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=330.0s)]
*  The guy who abandoned the platform, former President Trump. So Musk is saying we're not going to cooperate with your warrant until court rules on whether or not I can talk about it. And then the court ruled against Musk. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  Moreover, they held Twitter in contempt for again missing the deadline to comply with the warrant, which means in addition to access to Trump's account, the company had to fork over $350,000 in fines. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=350.2s)]
*  If you were shocked and surprised today to learn that Jack Smith got access to Trump's account, whatever private messages might be contained therein, know you may not be alone. Donald Trump claims that he is as well. Today he posted, quote, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=362.88s)]
*  Just found out that crooked Joe Biden's DOJ secretly attacked my Twitter account. They didn't attack it. They just served a warrant on it, making it a point not to let me know about this major hit on my civil rights. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=374.76s)]
*  With just five months to go until the Iowa caucus Republican presidential candidates are crisscrossing the state trying to gain traction in the all important first in the nation race. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=386.08s)]
*  There's a notable common thread in their appeal to Iowa voters. They're touting their anti-abortion bona fides and praising the Republican governor of that state for passing and signing a six week abortion ban. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=395.32s)]
*  I appointed over 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=407.96s)]
*  And last year, those justices and you know exactly what they did. They ruled to end Roe v Wade. We did a phenomenal thing for our country and for life. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=415.96s)]
*  I'm pro life. I don't apologize for it. I welcome the progress on the right to life here in Iowa and states around the country. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=426.96s)]
*  We're proud of what we did in Florida with with the heartbeat bill. We commend Kim Reynolds here in Iowa for doing the same. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=432.72s)]
*  I should note the near total abortion ban signed by Iowa Republican Governor Kim Reynolds last month was almost immediately blocked by the courts. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=438.72s)]
*  While it may seem like nothing new for Republicans to be campaigning against abortion, it has proven to be just really, really bad politics. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=445.72s)]
*  It has proven to be just really, really bad politics because we have seen in the 411 days since the fall of Roe v Wade all over the country, Americans are overwhelmingly backing abortion rights and repudiating the Dobbs decision that took them away. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=454.48s)]
*  In every state, every state where abortion has been on the ballot, conservative states, liberal states, the anti-abortion cause has lost. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=470.48s)]
*  First in Kansas just six weeks after the Supreme Court ruling, then in Vermont, in Montana, in Michigan, in Kentucky, California in the November midterms, every single time voters came out in droves to resoundingly reject the Republican position on abortion. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=478.24s)]
*  And last night it happened again in Ohio. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=493.24s)]
*  Voters there overwhelmingly defeated a measure, rushed onto the ballot in the dead of summer special election that would have raised the threshold required to amend the state constitution. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=496.24s)]
*  It was a thinly veiled effort by state Republicans to make it harder to pass a measure enshrining abortion rights, which will be up for a vote in November and now will only need a majority to change the state constitution. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=506.0s)]
*  As one conservative noted, quote, the Ohio result needs to be a five alarm fire for the pro-life movement. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=518.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyhHrgCnw0&t=536.0s)]
