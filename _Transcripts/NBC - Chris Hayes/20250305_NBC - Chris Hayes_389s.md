# ‘Sloppiest nonsense’: Hayes tallies up DOGE’s ‘embarrassing, humiliating’ mistakes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0)
*  Doge and OMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=0.0s)]
*  to fund condoms in Gaza. That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. So that's what this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  pause is focused on, being good stewards of tax dollars. That was White House press secretary [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=11.68s)]
*  during her first official on-camera press briefing back in January. This was going to be the first [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=16.56s)]
*  big gotcha from Doge, right? Elon Musk and his cronies stopped the contract for 50 million U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=21.6s)]
*  dollars worth of condoms to be sent to Gaza. Can you believe it? Get a load of that one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=27.6s)]
*  You've heard this before. You know it was a lie. It was obvious and flagrant. Anyone with common [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  sense could tell it was untrue. As Jeremy Kanondike, formerly of USAID, pointed out in my podcast [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=37.92s)]
*  recently, the U.S. government gets condoms for about five cents each, 20 for a dollar, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=43.36s)]
*  which means 50 million dollars would buy a billion condoms or roughly 470 condoms [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=48.88s)]
*  for every Gaza resident. The claim was swiftly debunked. Musk got called out on it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=57.12s)]
*  Well, first of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. So [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=64.96s)]
*  nobody's going to bet a thousand. I mean, we will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=70.72s)]
*  correct any mistakes. Whoopsies. Some of the things Musk says will be incorrect might be the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=75.44s)]
*  understatement of the year. I mean, we're what, six, seven weeks into this has been the most [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=80.64s)]
*  embarrassing, humiliating exercise I've ever seen in modern political life. Just this week, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=85.12s)]
*  Reuters did an exhaustive analysis of what Doge claims to be its results. New York Times has done [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=89.92s)]
*  something similar. They audited the random claims of so-called savings and waste that Doge periodically [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  throws on its bare bones website. Reuters found in its latest update this week, Doge either modified [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  or removed more than a thousand entries on its list, nearly half of the spending arrangements [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=106.16s)]
*  it had listed the week before. Yeah, that's like 50%, not batting a thousand. A thousand entries. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=113.04s)]
*  Now, why do you think Doge modified or deleted those records? Could it be because they are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  constantly, embarrassingly wrong about everything? Just the sloppiest nonsense. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Just some examples. Same Reuters analysis found that Doge triple counted a $655 million contract, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  claiming more than $1.8 billion in savings that didn't exist. Same contract, counted three times. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=136.88s)]
*  You're probably familiar with this other blunder. Doge claimed it saved $8 billion by canceling a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=142.56s)]
*  contract with the Office of Diversity and Civil Rights at ICE. You can see it right there, $8 billion [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=146.96s)]
*  with a B, right? Nine zeros. If you look a little closer, you can see the number is actually, oh, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=152.4s)]
*  right, $8 million. $8 million. They make these mistakes all the time. It's all over the place. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=158.32s)]
*  The only reason they ever fix the mistakes, to be clear, is because they get caught by Reuters [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  or the New York Times or someone else. Even the contracts still up on the site don't make a ton [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=168.96s)]
*  of sense. Hundreds of them show savings of $0. And even when there are savings, they're not like [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  savings that they take credit for the programs that ended under previous presidents, including [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  at least one from the George W. Bush administration. Again, this is not to say that some of the stuff [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=188.0s)]
*  they're doing is just canceling contracts that are good policy that they're just not going to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  pay for. That's not really a savings. Like, you could stop paying your mortgage. Would that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=198.64s)]
*  count as a savings? I guess. At some point, you're going to have to deal with it. And this is just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=204.72s)]
*  about the errors and confusion with what they're actually reporting themselves. We're not even [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  getting into the other blunders Musk and the Trump administration are stumbling into day after day [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=215.6s)]
*  after day. Here's another example. Yesterday, Trump's General Services Administration, which is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  basically the sort of building maintenance of the entire federal government, published a list of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=224.96s)]
*  more than 400 properties it wanted to either close or sell, deeming them not core to government [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=229.68s)]
*  operations. Now, that list included the J. Edgar Hoover building, aka FBI headquarters, and main [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  justice of the DOJ, the Robert F. Kennedy building. Now, maybe Trump and Musk are serious about selling [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  off the FBI and DOJ offices. Maybe they think Pennsylvania Avenue needs some new retail space. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=246.0s)]
*  Maybe Donald Trump's got a buddy he's got in mind for that. But the evidence points instead to this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=251.68s)]
*  being yet another cluster mistake. Because as of this afternoon, that entire list of properties for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=256.64s)]
*  sale is now gone. It's replaced the page that says coming soon. Of course, this comes after other [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=262.88s)]
*  widely reported humiliating blunders, like the Trump administration say, firing the nuclear [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=268.48s)]
*  strategy experts and the people trying to prevent a bird flu epidemic and then scrambling to hire [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=274.0s)]
*  them back when they realize what they've done again after press reports caught them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=279.92s)]
*  Yeah, everyone makes mistakes, but listen to me here. I've been in journalism for 25 years. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay. If you were a publication or a cable news show and you made this many mistakes in such a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=292.16s)]
*  short period of time, you would be fired. That's it. Like 100%. I think the public might be getting [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=299.12s)]
*  tired of all the errors too. The head of the national Republican congressional committee is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=308.8s)]
*  telling his people to stop holding town halls because angry voters keep showing up to yell at [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  them about DOJ. Today, Elon Musk had to march over to Capitol Hill and answer to Republicans [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=317.44s)]
*  with angry constituents who are maybe getting a little sick of the reckless chainsaw schtick. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=323.04s)]
*  Elon, it's very upfront. So they're moving fast. It's not going to be perfect. There'll be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=329.2s)]
*  mistakes made, but we'll correct those mistakes very quickly and setting up a process so he can [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=333.36s)]
*  and his team can be contacted quickly to reverse mistakes. By the way, Musk has no authority to do [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=338.8s)]
*  any of this, whether he's making mistakes or not. Just remember that. The entire thing is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  flagrantly unconstitutional a lot less. And the process that Musk and his team set up can be [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=349.44s)]
*  contacted very quickly was Musk giving senators, Republican senators, his personal cell phone [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=355.04s)]
*  number to report DOJ mistakes. Kind of like a you messed up again hotline. I think Elon's going to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  be fielding a lot of calls. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ikB2PKaPo0&t=367.04s)]
