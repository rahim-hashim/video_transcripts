# Trump teeters on brink of violating gag order ‘He knows what he’s doing’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA)
*  Donald Trump spent the past week attacking the daughter of the judge in his New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=0.0s)]
*  hush money trial. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=4.64s)]
*  It started after an initial gag order was imposed barring Trump from commenting publicly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  about lawyers, witnesses, court staff, and jurors in the trial now scheduled to start [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=10.64s)]
*  April 15th. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=15.08s)]
*  In the days that followed, Trump attacked the judge's daughter at least four times on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  his Truth Social platform, posting her name, also posting a news story with photos of her. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=20.36s)]
*  And he basically painted a target on this young woman's back, so much so the judge had to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=26.56s)]
*  adjust the order to cover his own family members and family members, the district attorney [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=31.04s)]
*  writing quote, this pattern of attacking family members and presiding jurors and attorneys [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=35.8s)]
*  assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=39.56s)]
*  It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=42.78s)]
*  not only they, but their family members as well, or fair game for defendants vitriol. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=46.72s)]
*  Yesterday, the judge expanded the gag order on Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=52.56s)]
*  Since then, Trump has still been attacking the judge, but notably he has stopped just [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  short of attacking the judge's daughter. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  Joining me now is MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=61.6s)]
*  And first I just want to start with this that every time we do one of these, you can sort [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=65.68s)]
*  of lose sight of how just completely out of unprecedented it is, how different it is. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=70.84s)]
*  This just does not happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=78.88s)]
*  It doesn't happen in courtrooms. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=80.08s)]
*  It doesn't happen with defendants. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=81.64s)]
*  We're just in a totally different universe in which this man with a lot of power and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  a lot of followers is berating the judge's daughter. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=88.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=90.8s)]
*  And every time you and I get together, I show up on other shows talking about the extraordinary [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=91.8s)]
*  ness of the moment that in and of itself becomes ordinary for viewers who then grow inoculated [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  to this kind of behavior that is so far beyond the pale of what's acceptable in most courtrooms [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=101.08s)]
*  in the United States that we forget. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=107.52s)]
*  Or even what would be attempted. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=110.4s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=111.4s)]
*  Like, yes, it's unacceptable. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  But even just like in a universe in which there are millions of criminal defendants, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=115.04s)]
*  this just doesn't really happen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  No, it doesn't because most criminal defendants would face consequences far sooner than Donald Trump has. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=119.64s)]
*  So there have been some consequences, at least the judge or the gag order has been expanded. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=124.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=129.08s)]
*  And again, we've seen this, we saw this in the past with Nguyen Goh-Ren. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=130.08s)]
*  We've seen in other places where he does know what he's doing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=133.56s)]
*  And so he stops just short. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he stops just short. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=137.28s)]
*  So what does he do now? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=138.6s)]
*  He reposts other people's statements about the daughter in order to skirt the prohibition, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=140.12s)]
*  which is framed as he can't make or direct others to make public statements about certain folks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  He's not making a statement. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  He's not directing others to make a statement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=155.52s)]
*  He's merely republishing a statement. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=157.4s)]
*  But that has the exact same thrust and gist to the things that he was saying before. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=159.84s)]
*  There's also now a request for recusal, which strikes me as, you know, I don't know, a not serious motion. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=165.16s)]
*  I don't know what the... [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=176.76s)]
*  It's worse than that because it's the tail wagging the dog. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=177.76s)]
*  And one of the things I noticed in the opposition that they wrote to the gag order just a couple of hours before [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=179.64s)]
*  Judge Mershon issued that gag order is they said all Trump was doing here was trying to amplify defense arguments about Mershon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=185.6s)]
*  So in his post about Mershon's daughter last week, they claim that really what that was about was just trying to help his lawyers [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=193.04s)]
*  communicate to people how necessary recusal was. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=200.24s)]
*  I don't want to rehash exactly what he posted, but that was not the aim. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=202.8s)]
*  But here, what they're trying to do is conflate the political and the legal so that it all collapses into one [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=206.8s)]
*  and take what would be opposition research in an ordinary political campaign and sort of migrated into this case [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=212.44s)]
*  and the Trojan horse of a recusal motion. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=218.52s)]
*  Right. So I guess the question is like, you know, there's always been this sort of there's these two universes, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=220.32s)]
*  Like we saw this in the litigation after the election 2020, which is they can make all the wild claims they want to and be [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  hosted by Republican lawmakers and say all sorts of crazy stuff. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=231.32s)]
*  As soon as those claims enter a courthouse, they got reduced to rubble. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=234.64s)]
*  What good does it do them to be doing this in a court, I guess, is the question. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=238.28s)]
*  I think it's not that it does them any good in the court. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=243.12s)]
*  It's that the court is the forum for their political campaign now, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=246.76s)]
*  All the courts are his stage effectively so that anything he says in court gets amplified, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=251.32s)]
*  repeated and becomes a part of his political messaging. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=258.28s)]
*  It's not about trying to obtain a particular result in a court of law. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  It's about trying to obtain a result through the courts in our political system. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=264.96s)]
*  Right. Because ultimately, he's not he doesn't care about winning in the court. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=268.96s)]
*  He cares about winning the election because that's the only thing that will give him essentially the immunity and security from [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=273.64000000000004s)]
*  immediate prosecution and impossible prison that he would otherwise be facing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=279.16s)]
*  And perversely, I think he'd almost prefer to lose in these trial courts. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  At this point, right, if it will help him electorally and if he can only survive through November and prevail in the election, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=287.6s)]
*  he doesn't have to worry about those initial losses. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=295.24s)]
*  Marshawn's not going to recuse. Marshawn is not going to recuse. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUddlWGVA&t=299.88s)]
