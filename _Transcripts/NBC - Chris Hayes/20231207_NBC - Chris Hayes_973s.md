# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Dec. 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI)
*  You know that moment when you're watching a horror movie and a person goes down to the dark basement or out into the woods and you just instinctively yell, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=0.0s)]
*  don't go down there. Of course, they always go down there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Just like Republicans always do in the era of Donald Trump, one after another, they walk into his arms and you're watching and everyone's warning you probably don't want to do that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=9.8s)]
*  It's not going to end up well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=17.8s)]
*  And they do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  And then their careers seem to end in humiliating fashion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=19.6s)]
*  Latest example, the third shortest tenured speaker in American history, Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=23.1s)]
*  He outlasted only a man who held the gavel for one day and a man who died of tuberculosis. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=29.3s)]
*  So he has that going for him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=33.6s)]
*  McCarthy, like many, many before him and like every other Republican, had his opportunity to cut loose from Trump after January 6. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=35.5s)]
*  But with visions of the speakership in his head, he hopped on a plane just three weeks after the insurrection to the Florida retirement home when Trump was at his lowest to beg for an endorsement from a disgraced one-term ex-president. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=43.0s)]
*  But even that pilgrimage did not buy him much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=54.6s)]
*  No persons have received a majority of the whole number of votes cast by surname. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=59.1s)]
*  A speaker has not been elected. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=66.0s)]
*  A speaker has not been elected. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=68.5s)]
*  Has not been elected. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=70.8s)]
*  Has not been elected. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=72.5s)]
*  A speaker has not been elected. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=74.3s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy of the state of California, having received a majority of the votes cast, is duly elected speaker of the House of Representatives. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=76.6s)]
*  Yay, Kevin, not a boy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=86.8s)]
*  The outfit changes there, not because she was doing a kind of share sort of thing, but instead because it took several days. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=89.6s)]
*  Just nine months after that excruciating week, McCarthy was kicked out of the same job by a bunch of Trump-devoted magnolias while his good body, Donald, did not lift a finger to help him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  And since then, he's been hanging around as the lamest of lame ducks, clearly seething with rage, so much so that he was accused of shoving another congressman in front of a reporter while denying reports that he was leaving. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=106.2s)]
*  Well, hmm, all that, only in an else today that, yeah, not only is he retiring, he's actually resigning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=136.7s)]
*  He's out of here, done, effective at the end of the month, leaving his successor with a three-vote majority in the new year. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=145.7s)]
*  Happy New Year. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=151.7s)]
*  Just before two huge spending bill deadlines. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=152.7s)]
*  As for McCarthy, he is heading to the political graveyard along the likes of Jeff Sessions and Paul Ryan and Mo Brooks, Mark Meadows and many, many others. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=154.7s)]
*  Claire McCaskill served two terms as the Democratic Senator from Missouri. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=164.2s)]
*  She's an MSNBC political analyst, and she joins me now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=167.2s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=170.2s)]
*  Well, did you notice the way he, when he's, are you going to run again? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=172.2s)]
*  He went, uh, yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=174.2s)]
*  He was like, I really don't know. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=176.2s)]
*  Well, I guess I can't make news on that because I'm clearly getting out of here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=180.2s)]
*  I can't say no. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=183.2s)]
*  You know, I think the Republicans need to realize they've got a problem. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=184.2s)]
*  Look at the history of speakers the Republican Party has produced and look at what has happened. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=188.7s)]
*  Going back to Gingrich, I mean, there's been scandal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=194.7s)]
*  I mean, Ryan's the only one that legitimately served until the Democrats took over. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=197.7s)]
*  Boehner got chased out in October after an election the previous November. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=202.7s)]
*  So meanwhile, Pelosi, and by the way, I don't want anybody to say, well, the Democrats are easier to keep together. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=208.7s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=215.7s)]
*  No, they're harder, I think, by all. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=216.7s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=218.2s)]
*  They're harder, there are structural factors that make them a more unwieldy coalition than the structural factors in the Republicans. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=219.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=225.2s)]
*  But the difference is they really do want to govern and get things done. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=226.2s)]
*  And so at moments when it matters, they stay together. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=229.2s)]
*  And Pelosi was able to keep them together over some really rough waters. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=232.2s)]
*  And Hakeem Jeffries has done a great job this year keeping the Democrats together. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=236.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, I mean, what's the shelf life of Mike Johnson? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=240.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=243.2s)]
*  I mean, this isn't going to go well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=244.2s)]
*  It's not going to go well because either he is going to bring the Republican Party down in flames next November or they're going to move him out too. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=247.2s)]
*  We should we should. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=256.2s)]
*  You mentioned Paul Ryan, who is another one who basically was forced into the job of speaker by Trump, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=257.7s)]
*  Went and walked a set of humiliating planks where he I mean, again, he was committed to the ideological cause of repealing Obamacare didn't work. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=263.7s)]
*  But look at this. This is the young guns trailer for 2020. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=270.2s)]
*  This is the former future of the Republican Party. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=273.2s)]
*  Take a take a look. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=276.2s)]
*  There is a better way and the new team is ready to bring America back. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=279.2s)]
*  Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan joined by common sense conservative candidates from across the country. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=285.2s)]
*  Together, they are ready to make history. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=295.2s)]
*  Together, they are the young guns. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=299.2s)]
*  I mean, now, 13 years, a long time politics lot happened, but all gone. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=303.2s)]
*  All that entire universe of of what was going to be the Republican leadership of the Republican Party stood for Patrick McHenry, who's a sort of lieutenant of Kevin McCarthy, who served as on speaker. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=307.2s)]
*  He's also leaving. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=319.2s)]
*  And you can also understand why why people wouldn't want to stick around in that majority. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=321.2s)]
*  Yeah, listen, it's not a pleasant place. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=326.2s)]
*  You know, I talked to my friends that are still in office in Washington with some frequency, especially on the Senate side. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=329.2s)]
*  It's not a pleasant place to be right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=335.2s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=337.2s)]
*  So if you believe in things, if you have an ideology other than the personality cult of Trump, it's very hard to stick around because clearly the Republican Party doesn't stand for anything right now other than Donald Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=338.2s)]
*  And that's got to be really hard. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=351.2s)]
*  And by the way, those young guns, not only is McCarthy out in record time, not only is Paul Ryan gone and making big bucks on the board of Rupert Murdoch, but Cantor got beat. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=353.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, just beat beat. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=365.2s)]
*  Well, and he was and that when he was beat, he was beat by a guy named David Brad in a in a primary that sort of took everyone by surprise in a kind of sort of canary in the coal mine about Trump. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=368.2s)]
*  I mean, really, it was a popular own voters hate you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=379.2s)]
*  The base, the Republican Party hates hates the people that they see as a GOP establishment. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=382.2s)]
*  There is now just also a logistical issue that has, you know, when you speak about Mike Johnson, this is Marjorie Taylor Green doing her own vote counting. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=387.2s)]
*  She's now sort of a proto whip. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=396.2s)]
*  Well, now in twenty twenty four, we will have a one seat majority in the House of Representatives. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=398.2s)]
*  Congratulations, Freedom Caucus for one and one hundred and five rep who expel our own furry other. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=402.2s)]
*  I can assure you Republican voters didn't give us the majority to crash the ship. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=406.2s)]
*  Hopefully no one dies. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=410.2s)]
*  Right. And by the way, the Kevin McCarthy elevated her. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=412.2s)]
*  Yes. I mean, this is not not a well woman. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=418.2s)]
*  No, I mean, this is not someone who seemed to me. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=420.2s)]
*  Well, in terms of our values and things, I think most Americans believe in. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=423.2s)]
*  Yes, she is definitely out of the mainstream, way out of the mainstream. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=427.2s)]
*  Very much. And now she is like a pseudo's folks person for the Republican Party. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=430.2s)]
*  She's like part of the running Republican House. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=434.2s)]
*  She's talking about being vice president. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=437.2s)]
*  I mean, her whole book is a is an homage to how she should be vice president under Donald Trump. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=439.2s)]
*  So and McCarthy empowered her. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=444.2s)]
*  Yeah. McCarthy lifted her up. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=446.2s)]
*  And the fact that she's staying loyal to him, I guess in some quarters may seem admirable. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=448.2s)]
*  But it is scary to me that she gets the amount of tension she gets. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=453.2s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing every time we go through it, I said it was like a horror movie in the beginning. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=458.2s)]
*  But it's just it's such a cliche. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=461.2s)]
*  The devil's bargain. The devil's bargain is called the devil's bargain for a reason. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=463.2s)]
*  It is a trope of the Western literary canon in which you are offered a thing and then they're going to have to pay back worse in the end. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=466.2s)]
*  And we watch them do it over and over and over and over again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=472.2s)]
*  And eventually the devil comes calling as he has for Kevin McCarthy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=475.2s)]
*  Claire McCaskill. Thank you. You bet. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=478.2s)]
*  Legendary television producer Norman Lear has died at age one hundred and one. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=482.2s)]
*  Lear is responsible for some of the most indelible TV shows of the 20th century, including the Jeffersons, Good Times, Maud, Sanford and Son. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=486.2s)]
*  He may best be remembered for the first show he developed all in the family, a sitcom built around Archie Bunker, played by Carol O'Connor as the bigoted, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=493.2s)]
*  oafish father-in-law who constantly butts head with his daughter's left-wing husband played by Rob Reiner. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=502.2s)]
*  What kind of a name is Tivock? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=509.2s)]
*  I'm Mr. Tivock. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=511.2s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=515.2s)]
*  Oh, Chicago. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=517.2s)]
*  I mean, what's your nationality? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=520.2s)]
*  I'm an American. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=524.2s)]
*  I mean, where are your people from? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=527.2s)]
*  They're from Poland. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=530.2s)]
*  That would make you Polish then, huh? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=531.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=534.2s)]
*  Anything interesting in the paper? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=542.2s)]
*  Yeah, two hundred arrested at the Vietnam Day Peace Demonstration. Two hundred. They should have thrown a whole bunch of them in the can. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=544.2s)]
*  Look at that picture there. Here they are, throwing all kinds of junk and debas at officers of the law, desecrating on the American flag. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=551.2s)]
*  What the hell do these peace-thinks want anyhow? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=558.2s)]
*  Now, Archie Bunker is supposed to be lovable in spite of his laws, not because of them, but to many Americans, his open racism and misogyny was something to be celebrated, even emulated. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=561.2s)]
*  Which may explain why, as Norman Lear wrote in the New York Times last year, nearly 50 years after All in the Family first premiered, that America elected a man like Archie Bunker as its 45th president. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=570.2s)]
*  Rob Reiner starred in Norman Lear's All in the Family, as you just saw. The two were lifelong friends. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=580.2s)]
*  But Reiner calling Lear a second father and Lear financing a number of Reiner's films, and he's a great actor. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=585.2s)]
*  This is Spinal Tap and the Princess Bride. Actor, director and activist Rob Reiner joins me. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=590.2s)]
*  Now, it's such a great honor to have you, Rob, and first just condolences on the passing of a man I know that was an enormous influence in your life. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=595.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, like you said, he was a second father to me. I mean, I'm not a big fan of him. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=603.2s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of him. I'm not a big fan of him. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=610.2s)]
*  I mean, I was very lucky to have two men in my life that were great role models. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=612.2s)]
*  Norman showed me how you could use your celebrity, use your fame to advance issues that you cared about. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=616.2s)]
*  I mean, I learned from him when he started People for the American Way that you could accomplish a lot by using your celebrity. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=624.2s)]
*  And so I miss him already. I love him. And I've known him since I'm a little kid. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=633.2s)]
*  And I'm glad to be able to come on your show to talk about him because, you know, this is a man who he flew 57 bombing attacks. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=639.2s)]
*  And I'm glad to be able to come on your show to talk about him because, you know, this is a man who he flew 57 bombing missions over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=650.2s)]
*  He fought his entire life for democracy and against fascism. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=666.2s)]
*  And we had so many conversations even recently in the last couple of months that he couldn't recognize the country that he fought for so hard. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=674.2s)]
*  And we now see ourselves on the on the verge of maybe slipping into fascism. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=684.2s)]
*  And it's just, you know, you can't wrap your head around what's happened to this country and how a man like Norman, who fought so hard, could see this happening. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=691.2s)]
*  And, you know, he mentioned in that in that op ed that, you know, that we've got a man like Archie Bunker in the White House. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=704.2s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is Archie Bunker. He was a racist. He was a bigot. He was very conservative, but he was human. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=711.2s)]
*  He loved his wife. He loved his his daughter. He even loved his son-in-law, who he fought with, you know, mercilessly. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=720.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is not he doesn't have any feelings. He's not human. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=729.2s)]
*  He's a psychopath and he has the makings. And you guys have been talking about it for days now. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=734.2s)]
*  This man and he says it. He's a fascist. He wants to rule as an autocrat, as a dictator. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=740.2s)]
*  And we have a big choice. And I love that I can come on your show and talk about this because, you know, to speak for Norman, that we have a choice. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=749.2s)]
*  We can either choose fascism or democracy. And that is it. And that's simple. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=758.2s)]
*  And, you know, we we can argue about issues once we've saved the democracy. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=763.2s)]
*  Yeah, let me read from something he wrote about this about authoritarianism. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=768.2s)]
*  He says, you know, as a young man, I dropped out of college when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=773.2s)]
*  I flew more than 50 missions in a B-17 bomber to defeat fascism consuming Europe. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=777.2s)]
*  I'm a flag waving believer in truth, justice and the American way. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=782.2s)]
*  And I don't understand how so many people who call themselves patriots can support efforts to undermine our democracy and our constitution. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=785.2s)]
*  It is alarming. And one of the things I find so remarkable and admirable about his career is here's a guy who was, you know, a stalwart liberal his whole life outspoken, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=790.2s)]
*  who managed to sort of pull off this very difficult thing, which is to sort of live his politics and to navigate the studio system and the bosses and to make great, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=800.2s)]
*  great, entertaining, funny television, all of which that embodied his worldview, which is, you know, probably better than anyone threading those needles is just astoundingly difficult. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=809.2s)]
*  And for him to do that time and time again over the decades he did is just a stupendous achievement. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=822.2s)]
*  It is. And what you say is exactly true. It is incredibly difficult to be able to deal with real characters with real issues that are facing all of us to present both sides. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=829.2s)]
*  And one of his favorite plays of all time was Major Barber by George Bernard Shaw. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=842.2s)]
*  And if you didn't know that Shaw was a liberal, you saw that play, you'd say, well, he presents both sides, the pro war, anti war case and equally. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=847.2s)]
*  And that's what he wanted to do with all the family. He wanted to give people a chance to see both sides, to have the discussion and then talk about it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=857.2s)]
*  And we were a nation of 200 million people at the time. And if you wanted to watch the show, you had to watch it when it was on. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=865.2s)]
*  There was no TV, DVR, TV or anything. You had to watch it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=872.2s)]
*  So that means 40 to 45 million people every week had a shared experience. And we talked about issues. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=876.2s)]
*  You know, we're so fractured and we don't really get to talk to each other. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=884.2s)]
*  We have one side, you know, I say I disagree with Liz Cheney, but I'm on the side of Liz Cheney when we decide we want to save democracy. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=889.2s)]
*  Let's talk. Let's argue about the issues when once we save democracy. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=898.2s)]
*  But right now you've got you don't have a Republican and Democrat. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=903.2s)]
*  You have you got Democrats and then you've got you know, it's like I said, you want to have an argument about an issue. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=907.2s)]
*  You have to both agree that two plus two is four. Right. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=913.2s)]
*  Then once you agree to that, then you can discuss. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=917.2s)]
*  But we have one party that says two plus two is four and the other party that says two plus two is Thursday or something. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=919.2s)]
*  I don't know what it is. And we're now and we're and that's the way Norman working. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=926.2s)]
*  It would get a laugh out of it, you know, and it is the toughest thing in the world to do what he did. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=931.2s)]
*  An incredible, incredible career. And also from every account I've ever heard of the Maya, just a true mench, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=937.2s)]
*  just a truly decent dude, Rob Reiner. Thank you so much for sharing a little bit of your memories of a great man that we lost. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=942.2s)]
*  Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Chris. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=949.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Yi1Nbu-rI&t=972.2s)]
