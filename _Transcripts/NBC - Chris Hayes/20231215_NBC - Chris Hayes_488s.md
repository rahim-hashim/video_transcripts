# Ex-British foreign secretary on solving the global refugee crisis
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE)
*  The White House is now urging Israel to end its large-scale ground invasion of Gaza and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=0.0s)]
*  switch to a more targeted phase of the war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=5.36s)]
*  White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=8.52s)]
*  Netanyahu in the government's war cabinet today in Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  According to the New York Times, Sullivan did not specify a timetable for the transition, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=15.56s)]
*  but four American officials said Mr. Biden wants Israel to switch to more precise tactics [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=19.44s)]
*  in about three weeks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  President Biden was asked about that timeline this afternoon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=26.36s)]
*  President Biden, do you want Israel to scale back its assault on Gaza by the end of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=30.0s)]
*  year? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=35.12s)]
*  Do you want them to tone it down, move to a lower intensity phase? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=36.12s)]
*  I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives, not stop going after Hamas, but be [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=39.8s)]
*  more careful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=46.24s)]
*  What exactly a new low intensity phase of warfare would mean in Gaza is still unclear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=47.84s)]
*  There are still 137 hostages being held there by Hamas, whose locations are unknown. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=51.8s)]
*  More than 18,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed since [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=57.72s)]
*  the war began just over two months ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=62.56s)]
*  Over 1.8 million Gaza residents are displaced, facing dire shortages of water, food, and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=65.24s)]
*  medicine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=70.2s)]
*  As the Associated Press described it, much of northern Gaza is now a quote, uninhabitable [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=71.2s)]
*  moonscape. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=75.88s)]
*  If the large-scale bombardment is going to come to an end, what does the aftermath look [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=76.88s)]
*  like? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=81.92s)]
*  I'm joined now by David Miliband. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=82.92s)]
*  He served as the British Foreign Secretary from 2007 to 2010. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=84.08s)]
*  He also served as a member of parliament. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  He is now president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=92.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=93.92s)]
*  I always enjoy getting your expertise because you've served in so many positions that deal [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=94.92s)]
*  with these kind of geopolitical issues. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=98.04s)]
*  First, just your reaction to the, you know, these bilateral relationships are very interesting. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=100.4s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel are probably unique among them, but the U.S. and Great Britain in a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=103.88s)]
*  somewhat similar situation, very close, but sometimes there's differences. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=108.64s)]
*  What do you make of this coming out from the White House today? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=112.92s)]
*  Well, I think that you, we all understand Israel suffered the most terrible trauma on [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=115.24s)]
*  October the 7th, a continuing trauma with the hostages. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=121.08s)]
*  But the U.S. obviously has to take a global view, not just a regional view. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=125.08s)]
*  And the scale of the death, the destruction, the displacement that you referred to in Gaza, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=129.6s)]
*  also the violence in the West Bank, that I think is prompting private conversations to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=135.72s)]
*  emerge into the public domain. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=142.28s)]
*  And obviously the stakes are very, very high at this stage now because the level of despair, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=144.88s)]
*  that's a word that's been used by UN officials who are on the ground. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=151.56s)]
*  We have teams at the International Rescue Committee in Egypt. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  We've got partners inside Gaza. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=157.56s)]
*  It's despair and very sober-minded people are now warning of disorder. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  There's a Lord of the Flies quality to the dangers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=165.32s)]
*  The anarchy is essentially the hint they're making. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=168.92s)]
*  And I think that's prompting this not just concern. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=171.72s)]
*  This is a very heightened level of worry about the situation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=174.8s)]
*  It's striking to me because I've now talked to a number of folks in different NGOs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=179.48s)]
*  And these are places that your organization and Doctors Without Borders and others who [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=183.92s)]
*  work at Save the Children, who work in dangerous, fraught places, I mean, places where terrible [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=189.44s)]
*  things are happening, who across the board say something along the lines of, this is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=193.44s)]
*  the most acute form of this kind of warfare crisis that we've ever seen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=198.08s)]
*  Well, it's acute because of the large numbers of people in a very small area and the wide [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  area bombardment that's going on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  We've published our watch list today, 20 countries at risk of humanitarian crisis. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=209.28s)]
*  Sudan is actually number one. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=214.0s)]
*  The situation in Gaza, the West Bank is number two. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  Sudan, though, 25 million people in humanitarian need, but a much, much bigger area. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=218.12s)]
*  What you've got to remember about Gaza, 40 kilometers long, a few miles wide, it's the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=222.96s)]
*  concentration of people there, the complete inability to get out because obviously other [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=228.76s)]
*  crises you talk about refugee flows, not in this case. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=237.56s)]
*  And obviously, this is something the International Rescue Committee works with a lot. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=238.56s)]
*  And that watch list, one of the things that you highlight, and we're just coming off the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=241.56s)]
*  latest global climate conference. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=244.56s)]
*  Something I spend a lot of time thinking about and sort of really worries me is when you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  look at immigration politics right now in your country as well as ours, right, in the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=253.92s)]
*  UK, the US, in all, really across the world, you see a rise of extremely virulent demagogic [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=259.56s)]
*  anti refugee, anti immigrant politics on the cusp of a world that is about to experience [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=266.0s)]
*  mass dislocation from the climate crisis. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=272.52s)]
*  Well, you're right to use the phrase climate crisis. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=274.64s)]
*  People talk about climate change. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=277.32s)]
*  No, it's a climate crisis for the people that we're serving in places like Sudan at the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=278.32s)]
*  moment. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=283.36s)]
*  The critical thing to understand, and this is why our report today is called Facts Not [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=284.04s)]
*  Myths. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a myth that America or Britain or Europe are taking most refugees. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=289.64s)]
*  Of the 20 countries that we're highlighting caught up in conflict, 80% of the refugees [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=293.44s)]
*  are in poor countries, not in rich countries. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=298.48s)]
*  Refugees from Sudan are going to South Sudan or Chad, very poor countries themselves. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=300.44s)]
*  And what I think the... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=305.36s)]
*  Yes, this is such an important point. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=306.36s)]
*  The Western world has to understand and has to argue we have a manageable caseload if [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=308.0s)]
*  we choose to manage it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  If we choose to be demagogic about it, if we choose to demonize it, we'll not manage [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=315.52s)]
*  it and it will become a massive problem. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=319.88s)]
*  I just saw this, there's something that happened in Pakistan with Afghan refugees, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  Pakistan has had three million Afghans. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=326.0s)]
*  This was the thing that struck me, right, was at one level, the sort of the same demagogic [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  politics, a new initiative from the government to basically mass deport and expel these Afghan [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=333.44s)]
*  refugees, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  And I thought, saw that and I said, that's bad and that's gross. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=339.23999999999995s)]
*  But then I also saw like there's three million Afghan refugees in that country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=342.2s)]
*  What they're dealing with is on a scale like so remote from what we deal with here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=346.84s)]
*  And when you look at the politics of the border in our country, it just makes you really think [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=351.0s)]
*  about how different those scales are. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=358.2s)]
*  Now we're an international humanitarian agency specializing in conflict. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=359.2s)]
*  You can't specialize in conflict today unless you're also specializing climate and adapting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=362.56s)]
*  to the climate crisis, because essentially what's happening is the states most vulnerable [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=366.48s)]
*  to the climate crisis are also conflict states and they're responsible for about 60% of the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=370.96s)]
*  world's people in humanitarian need. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  And unless we're able to help people adapt to the climate crisis, then they're going [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=378.72s)]
*  to succumb to it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=383.08s)]
*  Is there some magic key you have to change the politics of this? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=384.32s)]
*  I wish. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=387.08s)]
*  I mean really. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=388.08s)]
*  If there was, I might be doing a different job than I am now because there isn't a... [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=389.08s)]
*  Well, I watched the politics in your country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=391.08s)]
*  I mean, I want, you know, closely... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I've been living in New York now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm running a US-based NGO, a global NGO. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  But obviously the policy is one thing. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=399.4s)]
*  You've got to get the policy right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  Lots of places don't get the policy right, but you've also got to get the politics right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=404.08s)]
*  And that's true in developing countries because they have their own politics. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=407.96s)]
*  I mean, Pakistan has its own politics. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=410.56s)]
*  So do we. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=412.88s)]
*  I think the core argument is that either this refugee challenge is managed, is regulated, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=414.2s)]
*  is legal, is orderly, or it's unmanaged, disorderly, and grips us all. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=421.4s)]
*  And that's the fundamental divide. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=429.84s)]
*  And it's right. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=430.84s)]
*  It's like gravity, which is that people are going to move and they are going to seek places [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=431.84s)]
*  where they can live. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=437.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=438.08s)]
*  But remember, people want to stay at home. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=439.08s)]
*  The vast majority do. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=441.08s)]
*  They don't want to leave their country. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=442.08s)]
*  They've got their language. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=443.08s)]
*  They've got their roots. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=444.08s)]
*  They've got their commitments. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=445.08s)]
*  And what's really tragic is that the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=446.44s)]
*  have contributed, we've calculated, 16 countries, 2% of global emissions have come from those [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  countries. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=456.4s)]
*  They have the bad luck to be suffering the greatest needs. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=457.4s)]
*  We've got to tackle it because if we don't tackle it, it's not going to stay in those [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  countries. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=464.52s)]
*  David Miliband, it's always a great pleasure to have you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTyvYWLgXhE&t=465.52s)]
