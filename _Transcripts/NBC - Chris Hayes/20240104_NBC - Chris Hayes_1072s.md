# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 3
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and happy new year. It's good to be back here with all of you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks to the folks that filled in I really appreciate it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=4.7s)]
*  We are now officially beginning of an election year the promises to be a very wild ride [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=7.04s)]
*  The first in the nation our Republican caucus is less than two weeks away [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  That's the first votes that will be cast as political reports Donald Trump's campaign for capital endorsements is accelerating [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=17.2s)]
*  Leading up to that deadline and predictably [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=24.44s)]
*  Republicans are falling in line today [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=27.16s)]
*  You've got the number three House Republican Tom Emmer of Minnesota the one whose speakership bid was single-handedly destroyed by Donald Trump [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Announcing his endorsement of Trump's third bid for the White House [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=36.6s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas filed suit with a statement that I think perfectly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=40.08s)]
*  Articulates the insane false history that Trump and his party are going to tell to try to win this election [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=45.16s)]
*  Here it is senator cotton said in part quote when Donald Trump was president America was safe strong and prosperous [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=51.68s)]
*  The economy was booming working-class wages were growing our border was secure and our enemies feared us with Joe Biden as president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=57.92s)]
*  Everything has gone to hell [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=65.88s)]
*  Families can't afford groceries our border is wide open to a full-blown invasion and our enemies are starting wars everywhere [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=68.0s)]
*  Of course, we also heard Donald Trump making those kinds of outlandish claims himself [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=75.6s)]
*  Everything was perfect when he was president everything has been awful under Joe Biden [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  But recently while repeating the argument at a campaign rally in New Hampshire Trump revealed a really amazing tell [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Were you better off five years ago, or are you better off today? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=93.84s)]
*  There's no contest nobody would say nobody would say today what a difference a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=100.04s)]
*  President can make it really does make a difference a big difference [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=105.68s)]
*  Son you know so he said five years. Are you better off than you were five years ago now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=109.48s)]
*  He's obviously referencing the iconic line from Ronald Reagan that helped him clinch the presidency in 1990 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=115.32s)]
*  Are you better off than [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=124.36s)]
*  You were four years ago [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=126.88s)]
*  Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=129.44s)]
*  Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=134.52s)]
*  Is America has respected throughout the world as it was do you feel that our security? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=140.28s)]
*  Is as safe that we're as strong as we were four years ago, and if you answer all of those questions [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=147.72s)]
*  Yes, why then I think your choice is very obvious to who you'll vote for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=154.08s)]
*  Candidates have been using the are you better offline ever since and so here comes Donald Trump and somehow it's five years instead of four [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=158.76s)]
*  And there's a very obvious reason for that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Because four years ago. Let's see if we can do the math it was 2020 you remember 2020 you and I are both here [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=169.56s)]
*  We are in the midst of the worst pandemic in a hundred years thousands of Americans were dying every day [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=177.16s)]
*  Hospitals were overflowing morgues were overwhelmed the dead bodies were being piled up in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=183.4s)]
*  Refrigerated trucks they had to bring in we had mass [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=189.72s)]
*  Graves being dug in New York City and the president was suggesting the people treat the deadly virus by injecting bleach or shining UV [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=192.84s)]
*  light inside their body or taking a horse to worm [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  Tens of millions of people lost their jobs the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression across the country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=204.76s)]
*  Millions of people turned to food banks waiting in miles long lines like this one [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=211.46s)]
*  There was a genuine palpable ever-present sense of chaos and social unraveling throughout America throughout its towns and cities [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  Do you remember that in that year 2020 the murder rate rose nearly? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=224.74s)]
*  30% in one year a completely unprecedented spike in violence [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  So just in terms of these objective metrics a lot of things were going haywire in this country four years ago [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  while Donald Trump was president [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=241.18s)]
*  So let's look at what if things are four years later under President Joe Biden [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=243.74s)]
*  Thankfully the worst of the pandemic is over even a spike in cases as there are right around now actually [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=247.66000000000003s)]
*  This time of year does not result in mass graves and morgues overflowing in large part. Thanks to mass vaccination [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=253.02s)]
*  On the economy the country's having an incredible economic recovery in some ways [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=260.58s)]
*  The best it's ever seen the unemployment rate has dropped below 4% and stayed there for the longest streak in literally 50 years [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=265.74s)]
*  Job creation has exploded as the White House touts in that chart. Look at that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=273.26s)]
*  That's the over the course of the presidency. The US economy just added another 200,000 jobs in November [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=278.66s)]
*  Manufacturing spending and investment is off the charts almost literally you see here [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=285.74s)]
*  Right. Look what happens [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=291.58s)]
*  Yet another promise Donald Trump failed to fall through on during his time in office basically [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  Every major economic indicator is up under President Joe Biden not to mention fuel is now less than it was in 2022 [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=299.58s)]
*  There is one exception [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=306.14s)]
*  consumer confidence [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=308.38s)]
*  The thing about consumer attitudes in the economy is that there is a massive partisan lens to it [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=310.02s)]
*  Take a look at this incredible recent example [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=316.02s)]
*  So nearly 30% of Republicans who made more money in 2022 than they did in 2020 meaning their their income increased [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  Said their income had actually decreased and that's true of even those who made over [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=326.66s)]
*  $40,000 more [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=331.26000000000005s)]
*  They're making $40,000 more and they're telling pollsters. They're making less money. They refuse to accept the economy is doing better [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  In fact, they are in such denial. They are [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  misreporting their own personal finances and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=341.74s)]
*  It's not just the economy and I think this is actually crucial [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=345.06s)]
*  Since Biden took office that pervasive sense of social deterioration that came with the pandemic [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=348.94s)]
*  Is also showing real signs of healing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=355.5s)]
*  Remember Trump used this as a campaign argument claiming his opponent could not keep the country safe [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  And writes won't be safe in Joe Biden's America in Joe Biden's America will all be endangered [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=367.14000000000004s)]
*  You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=373.54s)]
*  First of all was amazing about that ad he was running in 2020 is that he was showing pictures of Donald Trump's America [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=377.1s)]
*  Donald Trump was president when that stuff was happening. He was the incumbent, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  So here we are four years later. We do not have widespread chaos in the streets in America [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=385.82s)]
*  In fact after spiking under Trump at a nearly unprecedented rate the country's on track to see a record drop in homicides for 2023 [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=390.3s)]
*  Yes, you heard me right crime spiked up during Donald Trump and it's dropping now under Joe Biden the most serious crime homicide [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=399.58s)]
*  Now America is a big unruly and complicated country with many many social ills many of them tragic and persistent [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=407.18s)]
*  It has always been a tragic and inspiring nation in equal parts [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=414.38s)]
*  But we are on an upward trajectory [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=419.54s)]
*  There is reason to believe it will keep getting better and that is why Joe Biden is running in 2020 [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=421.82s)]
*  And that is why Joe Biden the White House should welcome the Tom Cotton story about Donald Trump's America versus Joe Biden's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=427.38s)]
*  They should embrace that argument head-on talk about what America was really like [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=434.94s)]
*  four years ago [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=439.82s)]
*  four years ago [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=442.02s)]
*  Because the answer whether you were better off in 2020 under Donald Trump than you are now as we kick off 2024 is plain as day [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=444.02s)]
*  Joining you now is speaker Meredith Nancy Pelosi. She is Democrat of California [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=452.73999999999995s)]
*  It's great to have you on the program. I'm curious how you think about [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=457.34s)]
*  The message about this present and incumbency particular on that sort of central question [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=461.38s)]
*  That is always at the core of a reelection campaign [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=467.38s)]
*  For any incumbent particularly an incumbent president of the are you better off have things gotten better? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=471.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, thank you for your presentation of the facts of our economy [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=479.09999999999997s)]
*  Congratulations on your show and I'm honored to be once again when you're first [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=484.9s)]
*  I was on the first when you started and now the first for this year this election year [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=488.94s)]
*  I always see things from the kitchen table and not the kitchen table [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=494.7s)]
*  We see as you mentioned wages are up unemployment is down [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=499.5s)]
*  What is also so is inflation is? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=504.26s)]
*  Diminishing even though it's a net global phenomenon and we compare well to other countries [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=508.7s)]
*  But I also see the cost of course [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=514.26s)]
*  affordable care [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=517.9s)]
*  health care [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=519.38s)]
*  When you talk about four years ago and you see that the president at that time was in denial in delay [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  People lost their lives. He was fighting the Affordable Care Act. He said he was going to reply a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=529.5s)]
*  Repeal and replace he never came up with a plan now. He says [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=535.9s)]
*  Obamacare sucks [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=539.54s)]
*  Well, the fact is it is very high in public and public mind and if you're at that kitchen table [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=541.0999999999999s)]
*  The cost of health care is not only a health issue [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=546.9399999999999s)]
*  It's a financial health issue as well and all related to health is a woman's right to choose [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  Because that's an economic issue if and when you would have enlarge your family [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=557.18s)]
*  in terms of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=563.38s)]
*  Deque and everything democracy and a fair economy are personal issues are [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=565.5s)]
*  Personal issues so we have to be have clarity and how we put out these facts and I appreciate what you did say [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=571.06s)]
*  Also, the stock market is up and when it was up when what's his name was president [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=578.14s)]
*  He bragged about it women love me because their husbands 401k is [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=583.46s)]
*  and all that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=588.66s)]
*  the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=589.94s)]
*  Economy at the stock market is higher than it was when he was president [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=591.02s)]
*  So let's just take it to the kitchen table about people's health financial well-being [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=595.62s)]
*  their freedom to live their lives and again the opportunity that Joe Biden has given them with unemployment 15 [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=602.14s)]
*  million new jobs created and as you said some of the manufacturing sector [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=609.54s)]
*  productivity up [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=614.82s)]
*  This has been is a remarkable story and in a short period of time [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=616.34s)]
*  Most of that was done in the first two years with the Democratic Congress says she immodestly [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=620.54s)]
*  House and Senate with Joe Biden as our inspiration [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=626.5799999999999s)]
*  You know one of the great ironies I want to ask you about because if we have this comparison right four years [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=630.6999999999999s)]
*  We're now in 2024. So, you know, are you better off four years? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=635.26s)]
*  One of the great ironies I think about 2020 when you look back is the cares act [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=638.74s)]
*  Which was in some ways a remarkable piece of legislation and largely I have to say [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  the work of you [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=650.44s)]
*  and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=653.36s)]
*  Steve Mnuchin [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=654.44s)]
*  Basically, I mean it was it was a sort of it was the house leadership under your [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  Stewardship and the White House sort of tasking Mnuchin and one of the great ironies is that that legislation which really reflected the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  Democratic priorities of the house [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  Ends up sort of being a thing that I think Donald Trump tried to hang his hat on right [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=671.28s)]
*  So there's a sort of great irony that a lot of what was done to kind of help the country in this moment of peril [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=675.7s)]
*  Really embody the priorities of your Democratic Party and was used by Donald Trump in that election year [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=681.26s)]
*  I suspect will again as fodder for why he should get credit [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=686.9s)]
*  Well in addition to the cares act we had some follow-ups to it and I want to commend Maxine Waters and idiot [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=692.78s)]
*  Velasquez in how [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=699.46s)]
*  businesses participated how [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=701.74s)]
*  Diversity was represented and how the money was spent and Maxine if you could have heard [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=703.9s)]
*  Maxine and Nydia on the phone with Mnuchin it was something historic in terms of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=709.1s)]
*  putting it out there and also in terms of how the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=715.34s)]
*  funds were distributed the opportunity for access to to whatever whether it was a [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=719.82s)]
*  Would become one day a vaccine but the the measure of how this was affecting our community [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=726.62s)]
*  So again, it was the cares act plus plus [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=733.9s)]
*  plus plus and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=737.98s)]
*  It was bipartisan and made a difference [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=739.74s)]
*  But there was much more we needed to do that we couldn't do [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=743.46s)]
*  Until President Biden took office and we had the rescue package [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=747.54s)]
*  which really wrapped it up and drove it home in terms of [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=751.98s)]
*  meeting the needs of cities and counties and and state governments and the people who make our [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=756.22s)]
*  Society work whether it's transportation or health care teachers or food [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=762.42s)]
*  Services the list the list goes on yeah that that American rescue the ARP and then the subsequent legislation the inflation reduction act [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=768.26s)]
*  I mean again, this is like in the most basic sense of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=776.38s)]
*  Messaging you can almost on a graph the inflation act [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=779.9399999999999s)]
*  Reduction act is basically passed at the moment of highest inflation now [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=784.9399999999999s)]
*  Do I think that causally it is the case of the inflation reduction act which sort of was cheekily [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=788.66s)]
*  In certain ways to get your mansion on board was what caused the reduction inflation no, but again the way this works is [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=793.9s)]
*  Presidents take credit and it is the fact that the Democratic members of Congress and the president signed legislation [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=800.62s)]
*  Called the inflation reduction act and if you look at the graph of inflation afterwards, it literally goes straight down [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=806.66s)]
*  It does and and also there was deficit reduction [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=813.86s)]
*  The reduction of that for the national debt in the legislation [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=819.14s)]
*  I remind that the rescue package which was helped to create so many jobs and again support our state and local [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=822.66s)]
*  governments many of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=830.66s)]
*  Whose jobs are union jobs and many of which were women and minority union jobs [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=832.74s)]
*  That's really important and it also in the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=839.46s)]
*  inflation reduction act not one [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=843.46s)]
*  Republican vote [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=846.34s)]
*  Not one in the rescue package and not one in the in the IRA [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=848.02s)]
*  It's in the IRA if you talked about some aspects of it and of course, it was the biggest bill to [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=853.18s)]
*  Law to help us fight the climate crisis [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=859.54s)]
*  But also in the bill was the reduction of the cost for the first time [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=863.26s)]
*  We were able to have the negotiation by the secretary of HHS to negotiate for lower price [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=868.62s)]
*  Prescription drugs for seniors and in the bill itself it reduced the cost of [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=875.86s)]
*  Medicare for people with diabetes and the rest [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=883.7s)]
*  from six hundred dollars a month or five hundred dollars a month depending to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=888.86s)]
*  $35 a month the Republicans have said they're going to overturn that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=894.74s)]
*  The pharmaceutical companies are taking it to court [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=900.1s)]
*  Wait a minute, let's get back to that kitchen table [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=904.14s)]
*  Let's get back to that kitchen table. The cost of medicines and pharmaceuticals is very important in the bottom line of America's work [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=907.74s)]
*  Working families having access to affordable care act very important. So [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=915.94s)]
*  Again, there are aspects of these bills that have directly hit home [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=921.74s)]
*  For America's families and you know why? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=928.0600000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden insisted upon it [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=930.54s)]
*  We had been advocating these things for a long time and not having success with it [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=933.0999999999999s)]
*  But he was making it a prior as part of his vision [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=938.38s)]
*  his knowledge of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  Legislation and what has worked in the past and not his strategic thinking about how to legislate and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=944.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's all up here and then in his heart his love for the American people [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=951.4599999999999s)]
*  He cares and the empathy that he had for that kitchen table the upgrade the upbringing that he had this [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=957.38s)]
*  Understanding of America's working families. So when we talk about this [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=965.14s)]
*  We have to be trying to embrace everyone to make sure we're not fighting old fights. What we're doing is [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=969.58s)]
*  Making life better for them and that means [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=975.7s)]
*  ACA when we won in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=980.26s)]
*  2018 people said weren't you lucky that the affordable that health care was such an important issue in the campaign [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=982.9s)]
*  I said now we weren't lucky. We made our own luck, right? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=989.06s)]
*  We had ten thousand events to protect the Affordable Care Act from what the Trump administration and the Republicans were trying to do [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=992.46s)]
*  why because they were representing the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1001.14s)]
*  Big corporate America in all of this and their anti governance approach to how we meet the needs of the American people [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1004.86s)]
*  So I'm very excited about as Joe Biden goes that President Biden goes out on the campaign trail [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1012.26s)]
*  he can make the case very well because he knows firsthand because [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1017.7s)]
*  but sometimes I'd say to him we have to we have to get this or this or that he said Nancy I [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1022.54s)]
*  Campaigned on that. I wrote the bill. I'm all I'm there with you and in some respects he did [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1028.26s)]
*  So again, it's a it's pretty exciting [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1036.22s)]
*  This chance now when people are paying attention [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1039.74s)]
*  For them to see the difference that he has made you two have worked together for a little bit speaker emerita [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1042.66s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi of California. Thank you very much your time tonight [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1048.86s)]
*  You [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPA_W8dDruE&t=1068.78s)]
