# GOP lawmaker claims he's ‘qualified’ to ban abortion because he's a veterinarian
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA)
*  Donald Trump just had his worst ever day in court for now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=0.0s)]
*  Politically speaking though, the ex-president should be riding high. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he just handily won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He's cruising right now towards his third nomination for president. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=10.8s)]
*  Polls show he has a real chance of winning back the White House. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=14.6s)]
*  But instead of spending his time focused on all that, focused on his race, he has been [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=17.2s)]
*  showing up to and storming out of a New York courtroom. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=21.16s)]
*  He has been spending his days effectively, doggedly, reminding everyone that he was already [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=24.6s)]
*  found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=31.12s)]
*  Keep in mind, this comes in the context of Trump once again becoming the standard-bearer [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=33.96s)]
*  for a Republican party that has a glaring problem with women voters. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Of course, that's long been true. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  It was true from the moment Trump was inaugurated when millions of people joined the first women's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=45.0s)]
*  marches in protest against him, in large part due to his history of rampant misogyny and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=49.919999999999995s)]
*  allegations of sexual abuse. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  And this righteous anger was supercharged when Trump's three hand-picked Supreme Court [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  justices overturned a half century precedent allowing Republican states to criminalize [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=61.31999999999999s)]
*  abortion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=66.64s)]
*  And we are now, every day, seeing the dire consequences of that decision. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=67.64s)]
*  Women forced to flee their home states to get the medical care they require. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=73.6s)]
*  Women forced to give birth to babies who will not survive outside the womb and to watch [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=77.88s)]
*  their death in their arms. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=83.28s)]
*  Women forced to carry non-viable pregnancies until they are in dire enough medical condition [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=85.16s)]
*  to get treatment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=90.96s)]
*  Women forced to give birth to the children of the men who rape them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=92.64s)]
*  That's not an edge case, by the way. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=96.6s)]
*  In fact, a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  in Texas alone, more than 26,000 women have become pregnant as a result of rape since [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=102.68s)]
*  the state outlawed abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=109.56s)]
*  Take a second to think about that number and what each one of those women has had to go [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  through. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  It's maddening and unthinkably cruel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  It is the reality in this country because of Donald Trump and Republican men like him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  To this day, their effort continues, day in, day out, to take away women's bodily autonomy, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=129.48s)]
*  to have the state control them and their bodies like vessels. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=133.76s)]
*  In Wisconsin, latest example, a 50-50 state politically, Democratic governor, and a Republican [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=137.4s)]
*  supermajority in the state senate, the MAGA movement is trying to outlaw abortion after [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=143.2s)]
*  just 14 weeks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=148.06s)]
*  And just take a listen, seriously, listen to their justification for it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=149.44s)]
*  If you believe that a fetus is a human life, then abortion is not healthcare. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=155.76s)]
*  In my veterinary career, I did thousands of ultrasounds on animals, determining pregnancy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  and that kind of thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=171.84s)]
*  So I think I know mammalian fetal development better than probably anyone here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=172.84s)]
*  In my mind, there's absolutely no question that's a life. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=179.28s)]
*  I think the science backs me up on that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  Oh, thank you, veterinarian, Joel Kitchens, comparing women to animals. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  These kind of nakedly misogynistic comments used to end careers, like when Republican [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=191.64s)]
*  Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin said this about pregnancy as a result of rape back in 2012. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=200.92s)]
*  If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=205.6s)]
*  But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be in the rapist [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=214.0s)]
*  and not attacking the child. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=218.16s)]
*  Akin became a national embarrassment, rightly, after those comments. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=220.52s)]
*  He lost his Senate race by 15 points. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=223.4s)]
*  Today, in Donald Trump's MAGA party, men like that have been empowered. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=225.36s)]
*  They got their hands on the reins. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=230.28s)]
*  When Trump defames E. Jean Carroll over and over, or calls the woman currently challenging [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=233.0s)]
*  him for the nomination, bird brain, it gives permission to other MAGA men to behave the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=236.84s)]
*  same way, and they do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=240.96s)]
*  To decide that they are experts in, let me see here again, mammalian fetal development, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=243.12s)]
*  and they can tell you what you're going to do with your mammalian uterus. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  That is the agenda to control women across this country, either by bullying and defamation [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=256.16s)]
*  or through legislation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNp06dd83DA&t=262.40000000000003s)]
