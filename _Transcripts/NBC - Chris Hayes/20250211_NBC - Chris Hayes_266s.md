# Kash Patel ‘may have committed perjury,’ says top Senate Dem
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI)
*  We're likely to get final confirmation votes very soon for some of Donald Trump's most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=0.0s)]
*  unqualified and unfit government nominees, including R.F.K. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=4.4s)]
*  Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Intelligence. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=12.6s)]
*  But his pick to run the FBI for the next 10 years may stand alone. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=14.06s)]
*  That, of course, is Cash Patel, the pro-insurrection conspiracy theorist who has repeatedly vowed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=17.68s)]
*  to purge the Bureau and turn its headquarters into a deep state museum, who wrote a book [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=22.68s)]
*  with an enemies list. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=27.1s)]
*  Last week, we learned that Patel took $25,000 from her Kremlin-connected Russian filmmaker [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=29.06s)]
*  to help make an anti-FBI documentary. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=33.98s)]
*  On the same day, we also learned that Patel holds between $1 and $5 million in stock in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=37.06s)]
*  a Cayman Islands-based shell corporation controlled by the Chinese e-commerce giant, Xin. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=42.26s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=50.62s)]
*  Those foreign conflicts of interest should be, I think, disqualifying for anyone who [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=52.62s)]
*  wants to be the top cop in America. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  But his vote out of committee is still set for Thursday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=58.22s)]
*  And at Patel's confirmation hearing, multiple Democrats grilled him about his past ravings [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=60.94s)]
*  against the deep state. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=65.17999999999999s)]
*  And New Jersey Senator Cory Booker asked him if he was putting them into policy action. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=66.88s)]
*  Are you aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=73.38s)]
*  FBI agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=78.98s)]
*  Senator, just to be clear, I did not participate in any of those DOJ decisions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=82.82s)]
*  Sir, that's a yes or no question. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=87.94s)]
*  Are you aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=89.62s)]
*  FBI agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=95.46s)]
*  I am not aware of that, Senator. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=98.98s)]
*  Okay, I am not aware. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=101.58s)]
*  That was very clear-cut. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=103.22s)]
*  Are you aware? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=104.22s)]
*  I am not aware. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=105.22s)]
*  Under oath. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=106.22s)]
*  Just a few hours later, the Trump administration moved to oust most of the FBI's career leadership [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=107.22s)]
*  and scores of senior agents in field offices across the country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=111.58s)]
*  And the acting attorney general, a former Trump defense attorney, demanded lists of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=115.54s)]
*  all FBI personnel who had worked on any January 6 cases, thousands of agents, case managers, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=119.54s)]
*  technical workers and intelligence analysts. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=125.34s)]
*  It is a purge without precedent in American history. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=128.28s)]
*  And now, as the Senate prepares to vote on Patel's nomination, the top Democrat on the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=130.88s)]
*  Judiciary Committee says Patel lied to them about his role in that purge. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=135.22s)]
*  All whistleblowers have disclosed to my staff highly credible information indicating that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=141.5s)]
*  Mr. Cash Patel has been personally directing the ongoing purge of senior law enforcement [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=147.78s)]
*  officials at the FBI. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=153.86s)]
*  On the morning of January 29th, the day before Cash Patel's confirmation hearing, there [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=155.46s)]
*  was a meeting between the acting leadership of the Department of Justice and the FBI. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=160.9s)]
*  Reports from that morning meeting read, KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=166.98s)]
*  for DOJ. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=174.14s)]
*  Stephen Miller, at Mr. Patel's direction, had ordered DOJ leadership not just to terminate [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=175.33999999999997s)]
*  a specific list of officials, but to speed up those terminations. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Patel seems to be unable to wait for Senate confirmation to carry out retribution against [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=187.1s)]
*  his perceived political enemies. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=192.42s)]
*  Now, if those whistleblower and those meeting notes are correct, we have yet another private [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=194.94s)]
*  citizen unconstitutionally, illegally attempting to unilaterally fire career government officials. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=198.94s)]
*  But this is worth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=206.46s)]
*  Patel told the Senate, as we played for you, under oath, repeatedly, he had no knowledge, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=207.46s)]
*  not aware of those firings. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=211.94s)]
*  Durbin says that's perjury. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=213.7s)]
*  He has sent a letter referring Patel's case to the Justice Department's inspector general. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=214.7s)]
*  Patel appears to be lying about his role in the ongoing destruction of America's law [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=219.7s)]
*  enforcement and counterterrorism capabilities, the removal of apolitical career public servants [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=223.3s)]
*  to remake the FBI as Donald Trump's personal police force. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  I don't hold out hope Senate Republicans will ever do the right thing, but just maybe they [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=232.78s)]
*  too are unwilling to trust Trump nominees who are so willing to apparently lie right [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  to their faces. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zayo0alGVEI&t=242.62s)]
