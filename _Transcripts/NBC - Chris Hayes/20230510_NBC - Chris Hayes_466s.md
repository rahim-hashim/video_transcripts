# Tuberville on white nationalists in the military: ‘I call them Americans’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4)
*  In the face of glaring evidence like the ideology of the mass shooter in Allen, Texas, the far-right has refused to admit that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=0.0s)]
*  extremist views fuel violence and mass killings. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=6.2s)]
*  White nationalism in their telling is just another point of view, an ideology that's just as legitimate as any other. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=9.52s)]
*  And that view is echoed apparently [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=15.48s)]
*  by Senator Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee in a recent radio interview as he [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=18.2s)]
*  complains about Pentagon efforts to keep [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=25.44s)]
*  extremists out of the military. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=28.2s)]
*  We are losing in the military so fast our readiness in terms of recruitment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=31.72s)]
*  And why? I can tell you why. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=36.96s)]
*  Because the Democrats are attacking our military saying we need to get out the white extremists, the white nationalists, people that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  don't believe in our agenda as the Joe Biden agenda. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=44.8s)]
*  They're destroying it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  You mentioned the Biden administration trying to prevent white nationalists from being in the military. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=51.28s)]
*  Do you believe they should allow white nationalists in the military? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=58.32s)]
*  Well, they call them that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=63.08s)]
*  I call them Americans. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=64.68s)]
*  I call them Americans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=66.72s)]
*  Today, Tuberville's office attempted to do a little cleanup, trying to clarify. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=68.68s)]
*  The senator was just, quote, being skeptical of the notion that there are white nationalists in the military, not that he believes they [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  should be in the military, even though, as you just heard, the senator didn't really say that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=78.88s)]
*  Jamelle Bowie is an opinion columnist in New York Times. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  His most recent column, which is fantastic, is titled A Gun-Filled America is a World of Fear and Alienation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=86.24s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=91.32s)]
*  Jamelle, it's great to have you here on studio. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=92.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=94.24s)]
*  Let's start with the Tuberville comments, which you could charitably try to say that he doesn't believe there are white [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=95.84s)]
*  nationalists in the military. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=101.24s)]
*  But even if you charitably extend him that, like, that's clearly false as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=103.56s)]
*  He, I mean, it's comments he's clearly saying that if there are white nationalists in the military, they should be allowed to be [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  there. They are just as entitled to be there as anyone else. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  And the clear answer to that, beyond just the moral answer that you can't have white nationalists in an army that's supposed to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=119.84s)]
*  represent, or military that's supposed to represent an integrated democratic society, but that that stuff is actually harmful for unit [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  cohesion. There are there are people in the military, many of them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=135.32s)]
*  There are practical reasons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=139.28s)]
*  There are practical reasons why you cannot have those sorts of people openly in the military. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=140.32s)]
*  And so the idea that it is somehow anti-military or harming America's readiness to try to remove white nationalists from the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=146.2s)]
*  U.S. military is not just sort of, I think, wrong on its face for moral reasons, but for a practical reason. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=155.12s)]
*  It is actually the correct approach is to remove them if you can find them and they're identifiable. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  There was this narrative that played out in the aftermath of the Texas, the Allen, Texas shooting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=168.4s)]
*  And I'm sure you saw this speaking of white nationalists after some research by the folks at Bellingcat who were very good at [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=173.28s)]
*  sort of open source research. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  They found a social media profile for the individual who is said to be the shooter. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=184.16s)]
*  And it was clear that he was essentially a Nazi, called himself a white supremacist. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=189.2s)]
*  He had apparently Nazi tattoos. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=193.6s)]
*  There was this effort on the right to to rebut this, that it was fabricated or a Psyop. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  In fact, even people like there you go, there's the Nazi tattoos that were found on his social media profile. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Those are pretty darn clear. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=214.64s)]
*  Even though it was just obviously it seemed obviously like this was true, even Elon Musk got in on it saying this is either a Psyop or really weird. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=216.0s)]
*  And I'm just curious what you thought about this attempt to so strenuously deny a thing where it's like, what's it to you? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=226.24s)]
*  What is your investment in this story that it not be a Nazi who shot these people up? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=234.96s)]
*  I've been struggling with this as well because I want to be charitable. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=242.16s)]
*  You don't want to just assume that your ideological opponents or people you disagree with are just like sympathetic in any way to this sort of thing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=245.44s)]
*  But the refusal to just outright say, yes, that guy was a Nazi and identify it as not surprising that a person with that horrible ideology did something horrible. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the most charitable way you can think about it is that there are people who are so strenuously committed to the idea of basically unlimited gun ownership. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  That the fact that it does allow someone like an avowed neo Nazi to accumulate weapons and then use them, that is sort of discrediting. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=272.96s)]
*  Right. Like it begins to when you begin to ask the question, well, who exactly is a law abiding American? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  And it can be a neo Nazi until the moment they decide they're not going to be law abiding anymore. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=289.52s)]
*  And it's because people in favor of gun regulation are constantly making the point. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=296.32s)]
*  You cannot know when that moment's going to be. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=301.2s)]
*  So you have to keep these kinds of weapons out of the hands of people. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=304.0s)]
*  And the reality of the shooter in this case is a threat to those who want to push back against that notion. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=307.44s)]
*  You wrote this great column and it tracks with something I've been thinking about a lot more, which is that it's always been clear to me that that American gun lack of gun regulation and our the fact that we have so many guns more than basically anywhere on earth. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=314.0s)]
*  Is horrible for the consequences. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=326.16s)]
*  Right. But I think it's a sort of fundamental existential question for our society. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=328.72s)]
*  Right. I've started to believe that more and more. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=333.6s)]
*  And you articulate this beautifully in this column. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=335.92s)]
*  You say a world with a lot of guns is a world of fear and alienation where people live in a state of heightened awareness, even anxiety, which might be the point for conservatives who want that world, who want, in a sense, that polite society, because what will survive our hierarchy and force and the power to make others bend your will. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=337.6s)]
*  And if they refuse, if they insist on the right to live free of fear, well, that's what the guns are for. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=352.08s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=358.88s)]
*  What are the stakes of having an armed society like we have? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  The thing about any democratic society is that it is built on at least the principle of equality between persons. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=365.36s)]
*  Right. That we count equally politically, but we also can equally socially. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=371.76s)]
*  And that's how this is supposed to work. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  But the kind of society of unlimited open arms, right, that's what constitutional carry means, all these buzzwords for just anyone can buy a weapon and anyone can carry it without any kind of licensing or anything. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=378.24s)]
*  And you have to think that anyone you might encounter might be carrying. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=390.0s)]
*  Right. That obliterates any attempt for people to meet each other as equals, to insist on respect from each other, to engage in the world together. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=393.36s)]
*  Because when you know, when you are aware that the wrong word to the wrong person could lead to your annihilation, not you're not going to feel bad. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=403.68s)]
*  It's not an insult. It could be killed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=412.8s)]
*  That essentially dissolves the ability to engage in anything like democratic discourse. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=415.72s)]
*  It dissolves the ability to exist in a society as equals because that puts you in a fundamentally unequal relation to the people around you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=423.24s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=431.76s)]
*  It's the one phrase, and I think someone else was a law professor who coined this, of the Second Amendment eating the first. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=432.52s)]
*  The Second Amendment eating the entire constitution. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  The whole constitution. Jamel Bowie, one of my favorite writers and thinkers on all matters of public affairs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=439.56s)]
*  Thank you for coming to the studio. Come back any time. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRcGRO_YC4&t=444.2s)]
