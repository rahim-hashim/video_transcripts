# ‘Buckle up, buttercup’ Rep. Crockett sounds alarm over Trump economic agenda
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE)
*  Congressman Jasmine Crockett is a Democrat of Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=0.0s)]
*  She serves on the Oversight Committee, and she joins me now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=2.64s)]
*  Congressman, one of the things that's interesting about this, and particularly on the tariff [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=6.16s)]
*  front, is we have a very different system than the UK with many more veto points. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=9.52s)]
*  It's much harder when you're elected as a new government in the U.S. to just like get [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=16.26s)]
*  your budget through and start doing it, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=20.66s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of different things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=22.28s)]
*  But on tariffs, because of the law and the statutory authority the president's been granted, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  he can kind of unilaterally do a lot of this stuff while you in Congress just basically [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=29.94s)]
*  watch. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you know, my only hope is that we can rid ourselves of Donald Trump half as quickly [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  as the UK got rid of their failed leadership. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=45.06s)]
*  That is the only hope that I could have, but something tells me that he will stick around [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=48.6s)]
*  for the entire four years. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=54.02s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=55.02s)]
*  And as someone who serves on the Agriculture Committee, one of the things that we saw is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=56.540000000000006s)]
*  that our soybean farmers specifically suffered so much under these tariffs last time, and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=59.86s)]
*  it wasn't as widespread as what he's proposing this time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=64.9s)]
*  The fact that we have Americans that are waking up and saying, wait a minute, are you saying [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=67.9s)]
*  that tariffs are going to negatively impact me? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=71.3s)]
*  Are you saying that we're going to have to pay for this? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=74.62s)]
*  It's kind of like that wall that we're still waiting on Mexico to build, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=76.42s)]
*  That they're going to pay for it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=80.42s)]
*  No, we're going to pay for it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=81.58s)]
*  We're going to be the ones that are suffering. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=82.62s)]
*  And for those that thought that inflation was bad, even though it has come down, even [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=84.22s)]
*  though that it is honestly, you know, cooled off here a lot quicker than it cooled off [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=88.94000000000001s)]
*  in the rest of the world. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=93.78s)]
*  Let me just tell you, it's time to buckle up, Buttercup, because it is about to be on [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=95.42s)]
*  and popping if for some reason he gets half of this done. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=99.58000000000001s)]
*  And right now, looking at the henchmen that he is trying to put into his administration, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=104.78s)]
*  we are on track to see a lot of these negative things impact our economy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  Now one of the in a weird way, I would say the best case scenario probably for the country [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  and also weirdly politically for Trump would be to basically just not do it and say he [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=117.36s)]
*  did, you know, the kind of like sort of just lie about it essentially. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=122.6s)]
*  And I do think there's some indications of that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=126.56s)]
*  So he just posted about Claudia Scheinbaum, who is, of course, the new president of Mexico. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=128.52s)]
*  He says he had a wonderful conversation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=132.56s)]
*  She agreed to stop migration through Mexico and into the United States, effectively closing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=134.24s)]
*  our southern border. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=138.22s)]
*  I should note this is basically already happened. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=139.22s)]
*  It's been happening for about eight months now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=141.38s)]
*  Border crossings have have been near zero. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=143.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=145.64s)]
*  We also talked about what to be done, stop the massive drug inflow of the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=146.76s)]
*  Very productive conversation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Like again, no one knows. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  This was so weird about these. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=154.88s)]
*  He says, I'm going to do this massively destructive thing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=155.88s)]
*  Basically everyone on Wall Street and the Republican Party is like, he won't. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=159.2s)]
*  And now we just sort of find out, like, will he? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=162.0s)]
*  Won't he? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=163.88s)]
*  Will he do it for a few days and not? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=164.88s)]
*  That's sort of where we are. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=165.88s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=168.88s)]
*  You know, like I said, I mean, he instituted tariffs not as deeply as what he's proposing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=171.16s)]
*  this time, but he did do it last time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=176.12s)]
*  And so I don't see why he would necessarily change course, because according to him, the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=178.4s)]
*  people definitely wanted his type of economics back, not actually realizing that it was Obama's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=183.24s)]
*  economics. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=189.28s)]
*  And I will point out, just like you said, you know, when the Mexican president responded [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=190.44s)]
*  to him, what she said was, listen, this is not only going to cause you a problem as it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  relates to trade because, you know, two can play that game, but this is also going to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=199.96s)]
*  cause you an issue as it relates to immigration. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=205.28s)]
*  And she was highlighting basically that she has been working in a cooperative way to make [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=207.4s)]
*  sure that we could stop some of those crossings at the southern border. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=212.44s)]
*  In terms of the other part of the agenda that they really have telegraphed and promised [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=216.36s)]
*  is mass deportation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=221.16s)]
*  They've been very clear about this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  They think they have a mandate to do it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=224.08s)]
*  They say they're going to start on day one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  Tom Homan, who is the director of ICE and oversaw child separation under Donald Trump, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=227.88s)]
*  he was down at the border today for a big visit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=233.48s)]
*  You said something I thought was interesting about Homan. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=235.52s)]
*  Basically he has this sort of nebulous borders are position, which you'll work in the White [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=238.0s)]
*  House that he should he should have Senate confirmation that he should he should have [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=241.84s)]
*  a Senate confirmed post if he's going to wield the kind of power that they seem to be indicating [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=245.2s)]
*  that they're going to give him. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=250.68s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=252.68s)]
*  I mean, considering the fact that this was supposedly one of the top issues for the American [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=254.96s)]
*  voters and you're talking about a guy who is threatening to incarcerate people, you're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=259.64s)]
*  talking about a guy that is talking about, you know, looking at migrants and, you know, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=264.0s)]
*  I don't know what type of parameters, if any, he's going to be he's going to have other [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=268.44s)]
*  than get rid of people that don't look like they belong here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=273.36s)]
*  Like I don't really understand. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=277.36s)]
*  But when we're starting to talk about something that number one is going to impact real lives, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=279.06s)]
*  whether we're talking about incarcerating them, whether we're talking about putting [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=283.84s)]
*  them into these camps that they're talking about, whether we're talking about the fact [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=286.92s)]
*  that literally this is yet another negative impact that we need to brace for as it relates [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=290.84s)]
*  to our economy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=294.96s)]
*  This is someone that should not be given this amount of power and is not then having to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=296.26s)]
*  go through the rigorous, you know, situation that anyone else would have to go through [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=302.08s)]
*  if they want to be in the cabinet. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=307.04s)]
*  And I think that the Senate should have to confirm him, which means that hopefully we [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  would get an FBI background check on him as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=313.48s)]
*  In terms of the Senate is who confirms nominees, the House plays no role in that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=316.92s)]
*  But the House, we're getting near what the final numbers are going to be. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=322.04s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in just the next block. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=326.24s)]
*  But it's going to be a very narrow majority, narrower than it was, it looks like. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=328.44s)]
*  And as a member of the House, I mean, I guess it's not fun to be in the minority. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=333.3s)]
*  But this last House majority was so wildly dysfunctional with a very thin margin. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=337.12s)]
*  Are you expecting anything different this time around? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=341.36s)]
*  No, it is the one thing that I've been telling people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=343.56s)]
*  Listen, the one thing we can count on is that, number one, they can't count. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=350.12s)]
*  And number two, the fact that they don't get along with one another. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  So those are the things that we are holding close to the chest. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm really excited about Derek Tran. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  And we are watching another race in California right now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=364.0s)]
*  And he has pulled ahead as well, Adam Gray. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=368.16s)]
*  So we're hoping that we actually end up having more members of the House this 119th than [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=370.84s)]
*  we actually had in this 118th. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=378.56s)]
*  So we're currently on track to have 214, which is the exact same number that we had throughout [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  the 118th. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=386.28s)]
*  And if we can pick up this last seat with Mr. Gray, then we'll be looking at having [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=387.96s)]
*  215. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  And we know that Donald Trump has plucked out a number of members already, which means [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  that we may get as close as 217 to 215 if everything kind of works out, which is something [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=398.8s)]
*  that they have never had to endure in the 118th. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=404.12s)]
*  All right, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, a lot of them don't like each other. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  That is a statement of fact. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=411.02000000000004s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=414.02000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXrLCK-7gE&t=428.48s)]
