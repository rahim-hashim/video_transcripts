# How Joe Biden 'broke OPEC' and rewrote the rules for oil trading
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA)
*  Six decades ago, a bunch of oil producing countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=0.0s)]
*  banded together to form OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=4.9s)]
*  That cartel has had a massive influence on American politics ever since. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=10.38s)]
*  Just look at what happened after OPEC decided to put an embargo on the United States during [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  the Arab-Israeli War of 1973. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=18.38s)]
*  This winter, Americans waited in line for gasoline that they sometimes couldn't buy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=22.92s)]
*  They conserved fuel and turned off lights. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=28.84s)]
*  They paid more for oil, food, clothes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=33.28s)]
*  Some of them lost their jobs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=38.32s)]
*  Then in 1979, prices of the pump soared again when Iranian oil production dropped after [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=40.76s)]
*  the Iranian Revolution, and OPEC almost tripled oil prices. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=45.44s)]
*  And of course, the fallout helped knock Jimmy Carter right out of the White House. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  American presidents have been bedeviled by OPEC ever since, until now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=54.22s)]
*  Because to quote former congressional adviser Matt Stuller, Joe Biden just broke OPEC. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=58.54s)]
*  And he did that through a truly incredible bit of oil market trading. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=64.26s)]
*  Here's how the economist describes it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=68.9s)]
*  In 2022, when he released 180 million barrels of crude, he sold at an average of $95 a barrel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=70.5s)]
*  In July last year, when oil was at $67 a barrel, he began to refill the reserve. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=77.92s)]
*  He has replaced about one-fifth of what he sold, posting a profit of $582 million and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=83.78s)]
*  has managed to time the market to perfection. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=89.78s)]
*  And Biden's streak is still going. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=92.86s)]
*  Here to explain it all is Dan Dickert. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=94.42s)]
*  He's one of the foremost experts on oil and energy markets, founder of the Energy Word [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=96.66s)]
*  newsletter. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=100.26s)]
*  And back in October 2022, he really called this whole thing into a piece titled, Joe [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=101.26s)]
*  Biden is the Greatest Oil Trader Ever. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=105.22s)]
*  This has gotten very little coverage. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=108.22s)]
*  I think it's a wild story. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=109.62s)]
*  Take us back to the origins of this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=111.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=113.5s)]
*  So two years ago, what we had was the most bullish oil market I had seen in 40 years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=114.5s)]
*  Bullish meaning prices are high. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=118.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=119.62s)]
*  Prices are going to, and they're going to go higher because what you had is you had, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=120.62s)]
*  you're coming out of a pandemic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=123.18s)]
*  You've got this demand, this pent up demand. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=125.02s)]
*  People want to go traveling. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=127.58s)]
*  They want to get back into the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=128.58s)]
*  They want to fly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=129.58s)]
*  They want to drive. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=130.58s)]
*  That means oil prices are going to go up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=131.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=132.78s)]
*  Now you have oil companies who during the pandemic got decimated by the pandemic. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=133.78s)]
*  They can't cover the oil that's being demanded at the time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=137.1s)]
*  And to add on top of that, you've got a new war, the Ukrainians and the Russians. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=141.4s)]
*  And now what the Europeans want to do and Joe Biden wants to do is they want to freeze [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=145.84s)]
*  Russian supplies out using sanctions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=151.76s)]
*  They want to make sure that the Russians can't use their oil machine to finance the war. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=154.32s)]
*  Because their oil machine is the biggest export they have. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  It's how they finance it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=162.36s)]
*  All of this combined makes for the most bullish product they ever saw. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=163.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=167.12s)]
*  They're going around putting stickers on gas stations saying, but Joe Biden saying, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=168.12s)]
*  I did this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=174.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=175.8s)]
*  And we had five and a half dollar gasoline here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=176.8s)]
*  We had seven and a half, eight dollar gasoline in California. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden goes to Saudi Arabia and does what other presidents do. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=180.88s)]
*  And he begs the Saudis for oil. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=184.04s)]
*  After being very harsh on MBS, who of course... [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=185.88s)]
*  You remember the fist bump? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=187.72s)]
*  Yes, he gave me a photo of the fist bump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=188.72s)]
*  After being very harsh on MBS, rightly after he had ordered the execution of an American [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=190.32s)]
*  newspaper columnist, various other human rights violations, goes back, does what American [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=195.4s)]
*  presidents do. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=199.52s)]
*  Hey, buddy, we need the oil. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=200.52s)]
*  We need the oil. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=201.52s)]
*  And MBS tells him to, you know, go stuff yourself. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=202.52s)]
*  Because he's not getting the transactional kind of deal that he got from Trump, who forgot [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  about the Khashoggi murder. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=211.84s)]
*  Of course, he's not going to give him a hard time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=212.84s)]
*  Who sold him F-35 fighters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=214.84s)]
*  There was this whole transactional deal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=215.84s)]
*  And at this point, MBS is saying, you're going to give me something? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=219.12s)]
*  And Biden says, no, I have nothing but the United States to give you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=223.36s)]
*  And MBS says, forget it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=228.4s)]
*  So he goes back home and he hatches this enormously interesting, aggressive plan to use the Strategic [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  Petroleum Reserve, which is our national emergency reserve system, to try and hedge down oil [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=237.4s)]
*  prices. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=244.68s)]
*  Okay, I want to be clear. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=245.68s)]
*  We're sitting on a bunch of barrels. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=246.84s)]
*  They actually exist in some cave somewhere. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=248.0s)]
*  They do. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  We have 580 some odd million barrels of it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=251.28s)]
*  And the idea is, if we're ever in an emergency in which we don't have any access to oil, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=254.16s)]
*  this is the Strategic Reserve. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=259.64s)]
*  We used it, for example, in Hurricane Katrina. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=260.84s)]
*  That was a major time when this stuff was released. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  But in Katrina, they released maybe 25, 26 million barrels of oil. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=265.62s)]
*  In this case, over the course of a year, they released 180 million barrels. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=270.5s)]
*  No one had ever done anything like this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=275.18s)]
*  Very aggressive. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=277.28s)]
*  Basically, because as he's increasing the supply, he's like, oh, you're going to keep [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  supply. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  You want to keep prices high. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  We're going to put a bunch of oil on the market and drive the price down. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  And we're going to sell it into the market. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  We're going to sell it into the market. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=290.0s)]
*  And more than that, we're going to look all the other traders in the eye and we're going [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=291.44s)]
*  to say to them, if you want to buy oil, the guy standing on the other end of this trade [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=295.0s)]
*  is the U.S. Treasury, the government of the United States. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  And that scared the bejesus out of every trader. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=303.28s)]
*  And traders started to drop their own positions in oil. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=305.56s)]
*  They were helping drive the price of oil down while the government was selling it because [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=309.32s)]
*  nobody wants to be long oil when the U.S. government is telling the world, telling all [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=313.96s)]
*  the traders, we want to see prices lowered. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=318.92s)]
*  We're going to do what we need to do to make those prices go lower. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  They're coming to the market. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=325.2s)]
*  They're saying two things. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=326.2s)]
*  We want this price to go down. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=327.2s)]
*  And we're sitting on these barrels and we're going to sell until it does go down. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=328.96s)]
*  Until it goes down. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=332.56s)]
*  Now watch. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=333.56s)]
*  And that's the end of what he did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=334.56s)]
*  And so the amount of money he made for the U.S. Treasury, this is the fun part of it, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=335.96s)]
*  is that he sold basically around $100 a barrel and he's been buying it back around $70 a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=340.12s)]
*  barrel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=345.84s)]
*  That's $30 that he's made on about 200 million barrels. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  Somewhere between five, six billion dollars he's made for the U.S. Treasury. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=351.8s)]
*  And that's why I said that Joe Biden is the greatest oil trader ever. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=355.24s)]
*  You just show this, April 2nd, they were about to do some purchases to replenish the reserves. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=358.08s)]
*  He canceled it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  So that's where he was. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=366.8s)]
*  This is him buying now, not selling. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  You want to sell high, buy low. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=370.68s)]
*  At this point... [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=372.44s)]
*  He canceled April 2nd, went down, went into the market May 7th when it had dropped $5. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=373.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=379.8s)]
*  And at this point he has such a... there's such a fear from traders of what the U.S. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=380.8s)]
*  will do next that he merely has to threaten one way or the other to make oil markets move. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=387.92s)]
*  But this is a really important thing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=393.04s)]
*  This wasn't done before. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=394.32s)]
*  This is an innovation in using the SPR to basically put a guardrail on global oil prices [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=395.32s)]
*  and to wildly diminish the cartels. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=402.76s)]
*  By the way, I think that Biden understands that as well as being a seller of last resort [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=404.96s)]
*  at the top of a market, he's going to be a buyer of last resort at the bottom of a market [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=411.12s)]
*  and also protect those oil companies to make sure that they remain profitable as well. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=416.52s)]
*  The point is that you've got to put guardrails on both sides of this market and by doing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=420.82s)]
*  so you create a lane, for example, for renewables to stay here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  For the green transition. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  You make... [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=431.65999999999997s)]
*  In fact, if you look at the stock market today and you look at those green market stocks, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  they've been doing nothing but shooting up basically because Biden has created a stable [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=435.62s)]
*  oil market for the first time in our history at some of the most crazy moments in the oil [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=440.46s)]
*  market. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=447.22s)]
*  When you would see nothing like stability, we have seen nothing but stability. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=448.22s)]
*  It's a tremendous success. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=452.3s)]
*  It's really an undercover story and I think it does connect the green transition because [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=455.14000000000004s)]
*  that price volatility is the number one political threat to the green transition because as [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=458.38000000000005s)]
*  soon as things hit $5 a gallon, everyone's like, oh, I don't want this green stuff. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=462.42s)]
*  That stability is key. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  Dan Dicker, thank you very much. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q2PWkZKIA&t=468.90000000000003s)]
