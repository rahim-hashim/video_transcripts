# Republicans worry Trump’s tone is sinking party hopes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well, the Republican Party is stuck with Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=0.0s)]
*  They won't say that publicly, and they sure as heck didn't feel that way just three weeks ago when many Republicans were talking about, like, winning New Jersey in the presidential election, thinking about what jobs they would have in the second Trump administration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=5.0s)]
*  A lot has changed since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic side of the ticket. Trump is now losing a race that he was pretty clearly winning before. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=17.0s)]
*  And let's not overstate things. I mean, Trump is behind in the national polling average. He's behind in the key swing states. But all those leads are narrow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=27.0s)]
*  The race is still, because of the nature of American politics, close. And as we have just seen in the last three weeks, boy, things can change radically very quickly, can't they? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=36.0s)]
*  But you know, I was thinking today, one of the themes of Nikki Haley's short-lived presidential campaign still rings kind of pressure. It was this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=46.0s)]
*  Most Americans do not want a rematch between Biden and Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=55.0s)]
*  The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=64.0s)]
*  Remember that line? I don't know why it floated in my head today. It's a real insight there, I've got to say. And it is transferred to what you see in the polls. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=73.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is now the oldest man to run for a four-year term as president. He is older today than Ronald Reagan was when Ronald Reagan left office. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=81.0s)]
*  And Trump isn't new. He's not some novelty anymore. He has been doing the exact same shtick since 2015. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=90.0s)]
*  He is also very obviously deteriorating in terms of his capacity, his capabilities, and his energy level. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=99.0s)]
*  As we saw in his glitchy, rambling, difficult to understand audio conversation with Elon Musk last night, where he delivered important public policy messages to the American people like this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=106.0s)]
*  Kamala wouldn't have this conversation. She can't because she's not smart. You know, she's not a smart person, by the way. She can't have this conversation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=117.0s)]
*  And Biden, we don't even have to talk about it. I mean, he couldn't have this conversation. He would have given up on the first half of a question. He would have walked out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=126.0s)]
*  That appearance, if you want to call it that, was the culmination of a three-week stretch in which Trump still attacked Biden, even kind of weirdly wrote this fanfic about him coming back to the race. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=135.0s)]
*  He's not running against him, just for the record. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=145.0s)]
*  He also, over the weekends, for this downright ludicrous and comical at some level conspiracy theory, falsely claiming the Harris campaign crowd sizes, which everyone saw with their own eyes, including the people who were there, had been completely fabricated using AI. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=148.0s)]
*  He suggested that Kamala Harris only became a black person recently, which is a racist lie, but also weird, the product of a brain that's been scrambled like eggs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=166.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is the same guy he's always been, and yet Republicans, I mean, God bless him, still think he's capable of being somewhat else entirely. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=176.0s)]
*  Now, I have to say, it's 2024, I've been doing this for a little bit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=185.0s)]
*  I have personally covered hundreds of new tone for Donald Trump news cycles over all these years. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=189.0s)]
*  Most recently, we heard it after he survived a genuinely terrifying close call assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, and in the lead up to the RNC, we heard that he changed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=197.0s)]
*  He'd mellowed. He was all about unity. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=207.0s)]
*  As one convention delegate told reporters, the real estate salesman, I think, is a different person. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=210.0s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=215.0s)]
*  Humility goes a long way in politics and attracts far more people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=216.0s)]
*  I think he's seeing God. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=220.0s)]
*  Does that sound familiar? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=222.0s)]
*  Haven't we been hearing this stuff for the better part of a decade? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=224.0s)]
*  He became president of the United States in that moment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=228.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=233.0s)]
*  He did something tonight that you cannot take away from him. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=234.0s)]
*  He became president. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=237.0s)]
*  You saw that humanity. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=238.0s)]
*  You saw that unity on display. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=239.0s)]
*  I think you're going to see a lot of reporters talking about the moment President Trump became presidential. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=241.0s)]
*  Once again, it seems like with every serious address he does, we saw it with his first address to Congress last year. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=247.0s)]
*  It's about how he acted. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=252.0s)]
*  Seven years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=255.0s)]
*  We've been doing this for seven years. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=256.0s)]
*  At this point, it's like Wiley Coyote in Roadrunner. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=258.0s)]
*  There's not a lot of narrative suspense about what's going to happen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=261.0s)]
*  Yet if you listen to what Republican insiders are still telling reporters, they want Trump to do a pivot. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=264.0s)]
*  They want him to be more disciplined. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=269.0s)]
*  They want him to be more presidential. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=271.0s)]
*  And this time, this time, it will be for real. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=273.0s)]
*  You've got to make this race not on personalities. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=276.0s)]
*  Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her position when it comes to what did she do as attorney general on crime. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=279.0s)]
*  Don't wander off. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=287.0s)]
*  Don't call her stupid and all kinds of names. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=288.0s)]
*  Stay on message. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=291.0s)]
*  The winning formula for President Trump is very plain to see. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=293.0s)]
*  It's fewer insults, more insights, and that policy contrast. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=296.0s)]
*  We can help our candidates at every level by speaking the truth to them respectfully. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=300.0s)]
*  I have some familiarity with that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=308.0s)]
*  I did it for four years. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=312.0s)]
*  I almost got hanged for it, but I did keep it respectful. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=315.0s)]
*  Like Pence, of all people should know, you can't change Donald Trump. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=319.0s)]
*  Yet people keep falling into the same old trap. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=322.0s)]
*  Even the people who joined the Trump 2024 bandwagon at its peak, the people who bought the stock at its highest right after the convention. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=325.0s)]
*  Some of them showed up to a Trump fundraiser earlier this month on Long Island, including billionaire hedge funders like Bill Ackman. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=333.0s)]
*  According to the New York Times, at the dinner that evening, Harrison Lefrak, the sign of a New York real estate family whose father is an old friend of Mr. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=340.0s)]
*  Trump's, asked how Mr. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=347.0s)]
*  Trump planned to take the narrative back from Democrats, what his positive vision for the country would be. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=348.0s)]
*  It appeared to be a request for reassurance. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=354.0s)]
*  Mr. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=356.0s)]
*  Trump provided none. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=357.0s)]
*  Instead, he criticized Ms. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=358.0s)]
*  Harris on a range of fronts before adding, I am who I am. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=360.0s)]
*  Say this for the guy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=363.0s)]
*  He has more self-awareness, more awareness about himself than a shocking number of people in Republican politics. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=366.0s)]
*  He won't change. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=372.0s)]
*  You know who else understands this? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=374.0s)]
*  The voters do. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=376.0s)]
*  Like the ones in this focus group held after Trump's first joint address to Congress in the nation as president back in 2017. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=377.0s)]
*  That was the one that pundits called so presidential. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=384.0s)]
*  That is no way the real Donald Trump. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=387.0s)]
*  Real Donald Trump will surface in probably less than two hours. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=391.0s)]
*  Let's focus on tonight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=395.0s)]
*  I think this is the Donald Trump. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=396.0s)]
*  Donald Trump needs to be. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=397.0s)]
*  And the next thing he needs to do is delete his Twitter feed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=398.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=400.0s)]
*  How many of you don't like what he does on Twitter? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=401.0s)]
*  Raise your hands. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=403.0s)]
*  How many of you voted for him and don't like what he does on Twitter? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=404.0s)]
*  Do you even have Twitter if you voted for him? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=407.0s)]
*  Do you have Twitter? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=409.0s)]
*  Because that's where you're going to see your real president. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=410.0s)]
*  If you don't have Twitter, you cannot defend Donald Trump. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=413.0s)]
*  Probably worth mentioning here that in advance of last night's Twitter show with Musk, Donald Trump got back to posting on the site. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=416.0s)]
*  That's the platform that he was kicked off on for inciting a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and attempting to end the American Democratic experiment. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=423.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democrats. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=431.0s)]
*  Well, they got something new. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=433.0s)]
*  They have an open horizon in front of them as they enter a convention united with a popular energetic ticket, a messaging opportunity we have not seen in our lifetimes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=436.0s)]
*  The Republicans. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=444.0s)]
*  They got the same horse they've been riding since 2015. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=445.0s)]
*  Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist for the New York Times. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=449.0s)]
*  His column today is titled What the Republican Party Might Look Like If Trump Loses. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=453.0s)]
*  Don Favreau is a former head speechwriter for President Obama. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=457.0s)]
*  He's a co-founder of Crooked Media where he co-hosts the podcast Pod Save America. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=460.0s)]
*  And they both join me now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=464.0s)]
*  Jamel, I there was there's a lot in that Times piece. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=466.0s)]
*  The Hamptons the scene at the Hamptons fundraiser with the rich folks being like, so so what's the what's the positive message here? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=469.0s)]
*  And him being like, what are you talking about? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=476.0s)]
*  I am who I am. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=478.0s)]
*  I don't know if like people are willfully blind to this or they're lying to themselves or lying to other reporters. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=480.0s)]
*  But like as you write in your column, he is who he is. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=486.0s)]
*  We all know who he is. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=489.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's really bizarre to see people just consistently refuse to to take Trump as he presents himself. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=493.0s)]
*  I honestly find it so troubling almost that these ostensibly intelligent people would be like surprised by the fact that Trump doesn't have any secret plan to get positive. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=501.0s)]
*  It's it's it's almost as if they are doing the exact same thing that I think a lot of voters did in 2016, which is assume that because Trump is rich and because he's on television and because people listen to him, therefore there must be something else there when there there just really isn't. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=512.0s)]
*  John, this was we found this. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=531.0s)]
*  He was at a rally, I think, in Pennsylvania on July 31st, which again, like I don't think of him as a particularly self-aware person, but he can weirdly be sort of self-aware. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=534.0s)]
*  And I think actually to the degree that he does have some genuine political talent, which he certainly does, it's it partly grows out of this strange self-referential. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=543.0s)]
*  But this is what he had to say at a rally when he was telling people back then like I'm not doing the unity shtick. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=551.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=556.0s)]
*  You know, when I got hit, everybody thought I was going to be a nice guy and they thought I changed. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=559.0s)]
*  Remember, just before the Republican Convention, they all said Trump is going to be a nice man. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=566.0s)]
*  Now he came close to death and I really agreed with that for about eight hours or so. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=571.0s)]
*  And then I realized they were trying to put me in prison for doing absolutely nothing wrong. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=580.0s)]
*  It's just it's totally perfect. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=586.0s)]
*  I mean, he's true to who he is, right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=590.0s)]
*  He is angry. He is filled with grievance. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=593.0s)]
*  I also think that he believes that an angry Trump is more effective and more true to his message than a nicer Trump that who wants unity, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=596.0s)]
*  because what he's trying to tell people is that the system is all screwed up. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=607.0s)]
*  Our institutions are broken. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=611.0s)]
*  The country is a horrible place and you need to be angry about that and you need someone who's angry, who's going to take the system down. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=613.0s)]
*  So I think that he's always running in a Republican primary. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=620.0s)]
*  That's his whole shtick, right? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=623.0s)]
*  Like he doesn't know how to reach out to moderate voters. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=624.0s)]
*  He doesn't know how to reach out to the middle. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=627.0s)]
*  He has won. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=629.0s)]
*  He won in 2016 because he barely got the Republican Party, you know, unified and he got turned out up a little bit and then he kept it close in 2020. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=630.0s)]
*  But he's never really made a move in these last seven years to win over undecided, persuadable voters. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=639.0s)]
*  And so he thinks that the angry shtick is who he is and he thinks it's going to work for him. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=646.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zG_gkIzxM&t=659.0s)]
