# Trump is not the first president special counsel Jack Smith has prosecuted
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Special counsel Jack Smith has just turned over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=0.0s)]
*  the first tranche of evidence in the classified documents case against Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=4.8s)]
*  The ex-president's legal team now have access to discovery materials, including evidence obtained [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=9.52s)]
*  through subpoena and search warrants, transcripts of grand jury testimony in both Washington, D.C., [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  and Florida, witness interviews conducted through last month, and excerpts of closed-circuit television [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=20.72s)]
*  footage, also included the grand jury testimony of witnesses who will testify for the government [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=26.16s)]
*  at this case. Now, all of this is a routine part of the process following Trump's indictment earlier [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=32.24s)]
*  this month on 37 felony counts. It underscores the surreal current state of affairs. Donald Trump is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=37.84s)]
*  the ex-president of the United States. He is the current front-runner for the Republican nomination, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=44.32s)]
*  and he is a criminal defendant in a federal criminal case entitled to exactly the same amount [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=49.6s)]
*  of due process as all citizens under the Constitution. All of those things being true at once [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=54.56s)]
*  is a real test for our usual rhetoric about the rule of law. Because it's one thing to say in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  abstract, no one is above the law, it is another to actually carry that out. And the task of carrying [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=66.4s)]
*  that out, of making it concrete, falls chiefly to Jack Smith. He is, by many accounts, an experienced [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=72.08s)]
*  independent force, as former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told me on the night the news of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  indictment first broke. I've known Jack Smith for a good number of years. He's a serious, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=83.68s)]
*  sober-minded prosecutor who is not going to be deterred by anything that Donald Trump throws at him. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=90.48s)]
*  Most of the discussion around Jack Smith's experience is focused on his previous work [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=97.92s)]
*  at the Department of Justice, where he led the Public Integrity Unit that investigates [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  officials accused of corruption. You may have also heard that he prosecuted war crimes at The Hague [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=105.2s)]
*  and seen these images, they're the ones we use, where he is dressed in the customary black and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=110.8s)]
*  purple robe. But you may not know, I really didn't until recently, is that Donald Trump is actually [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  the second president that Jack Smith has indicted. Now, this story begins 25 years ago with the War [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=124.32s)]
*  of Independence in Kosovo. Following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, a group of rebels known [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=131.44s)]
*  as the Kosovo Liberation Army fought for the freedom of their province from the Republic of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=137.04s)]
*  Serbia. And it was a very bloody conflict. It ended only when NATO intervened by bombing targets in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=141.84s)]
*  Serbia. In the years that followed, as you may know, the international legal community focused [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=149.28s)]
*  on the war crimes from that era, and they mainly focused on the former Yugoslavian president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=154.88s)]
*  Milosevic in Kosovo and throughout the Balkans. But in 2008, accusations of war crimes on the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=160.72s)]
*  Kosovan side emerged in a tell-all book written by a Swiss prosecutor. She alleged the Kosovo Liberation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=168.24s)]
*  Army, or the KLA, that was the rebels that were fighting, had also committed torture, that they [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=175.76s)]
*  had even harvested organs from Serbian prisoners. After the Council of Europe published evidence of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=180.96s)]
*  some of those same claims in 2011, a special court was set up at The Hague specifically focused on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=188.24s)]
*  those crimes. And seven years later, in 2018, Jack Smith arrived to take over what was called the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=194.8s)]
*  Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor's Office. Now, by that time, when he arrived in 2018, the court's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=201.68s)]
*  efforts had largely stalled. It was kind of a more abundant investigation. I mean, at this point, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=207.52s)]
*  it had been nearly two decades since the actual war, and the war crimes had been committed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=213.36s)]
*  And crucially, the former leaders of that rebel army, the KLA, were now in charge of the newly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=217.84s)]
*  independent country. One of them, Hashim Thaci, rose to become the prime minister, and then the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=224.32s)]
*  president. As one of Jack Smith's predecessors explained, the task at hand was like prosecuting [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=230.88s)]
*  Kosovo's equivalent of Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton. Quote, if you indict these [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=237.2s)]
*  people, you're saying the founding fathers of Kosovo have committed atrocities, and I'm ready [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  to prove it in an independent court with independent judges and rules that apply to everyone. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=246.96s)]
*  Another former head of the Specialist Prosecutor's Office, Clint Williamson, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  explained that Smith focused on getting witnesses that had contributed to the process earlier [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=256.64s)]
*  to come on board again. And then Smith and his office focused on the chain of command. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=261.36s)]
*  Williamson says, quote, this is not unlike organized crime prosecutions. A mafia boss very [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=266.72s)]
*  rarely pulls the trigger himself. You have to develop the linkages between the trigger puller [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=271.44s)]
*  and the big boss who's giving the orders. Well, the work paid off. In June of 2020, in the midst [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=276.48s)]
*  of a global pandemic, when Smith's office announced that it was seeking an indictment [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  against the then sitting president of the new nation, Kosovo, Hashim Thaci, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=288.48s)]
*  and included 10 counts on various war crime charges, including nearly 100 murders and the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=294.0s)]
*  torture of hundreds of victims. In fact, the announcement came while Thaci himself was in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=300.0s)]
*  midair flying to the United States for a meeting with none other than, yes, then President Donald [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=306.24s)]
*  Trump. The two men had met before in New York and in Paris, but these were to be formal talks [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=312.24s)]
*  at the White House meant to boost Trump's diplomatic bonafides. Now a source told the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=317.6s)]
*  Dilly Beast, it now appears that prosecutors with their announcement were trying to stop Thaci from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=321.92s)]
*  using that meeting with Trump to pressure the United States to drop the case against him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=327.2s)]
*  After learning of the indictment, Thaci did cancel the visit and return home to Kosovo. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  A little over four months later, after a judge confirmed the charges against him, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=337.36s)]
*  Thaci resigned from the presidency. He flew to The Hague where he was taken into custody. The man [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=341.76s)]
*  who had been the sitting president of this new nation, a hero, a founding father. And Jack [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=348.32s)]
*  Smith continued methodically plugging away at his work, trying several of Thaci's former allies [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=354.24s)]
*  in the KLA. Your honor, this is a case about the conditions required for the fair administration [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=360.0s)]
*  of justice and attempts by the accused to block the path of justice for so many. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=367.44s)]
*  This is a case about what is required to make rule of law a reality. Think of that line. Think [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=375.76s)]
*  of that line. This is a case about what is required to make the rule of law a reality. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=382.72s)]
*  Now, even without Jack Smith, who of course has got a new job, Hashim Thaci's trial continues in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=390.24s)]
*  The Hague. It's ongoing. He remains in detention. Of course, just like Donald Trump, the former [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=395.44000000000005s)]
*  president of Kosovo remains innocent until proven guilty. He is due process. We do not know the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=400.24s)]
*  outcome of his trial or what it will be. Although the Kosovo specialist prosecutor's office has [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  since convicted three other people. And with Jack Smith back here in the U.S., it appears that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=410.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is hoping that he can run out the clock, that he can delay long enough to successfully [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=416.88s)]
*  restore himself to the White House so that he can get rid of this whole thing, so that he can declare [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=422.48s)]
*  himself above the law. But given his very recent history, it seems pretty clear Jack [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=427.44s)]
*  Smith is committed to not letting that happen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5Xy53fDUU&t=434.32s)]
