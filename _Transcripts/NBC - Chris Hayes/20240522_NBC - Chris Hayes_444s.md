# AOC on the real story behind that Marjorie Taylor Greene exchange
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A)
*  Joining me again, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who sits on the House Oversight Committee and had that exchange with Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, in some ways, you know, there's a fair amount of theater and performance, I think, on Capitol Hill, but also I could sense in you in that moment, like, genuine outrage at what was being done. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=7.0s)]
*  What is your takeaway from that moment and more broadly the kind of culture of the place it seems to cultivate those sorts of antics? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=19.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, well, first and foremost, I know that a lot of folks kind of saw these clips going around that were often highlights of what had happened. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=27.0s)]
*  But a lot of that was a result of structural changes that Republicans decided to make in real time to essentially throw out the House handbook that, frankly, and the House rules for committee guidance and for committee conduct through a vote. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=35.0s)]
*  There was actually a procedural vote in which every single Republican went down the line and decide to vote that the comments that Marjorie Taylor Greene, the disgusting comments that she made about Representative Crockett, were in fact above board and acceptable, which is rather unprecedented in the House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=54.0s)]
*  These rules are they were established in the 1800s, short up in the 1800s after the caning involving Charles Sumner in the Senate, precisely designed to de-escalate a political culture of violence when things get too hot. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=73.0s)]
*  And in fact, when I was a freshman coming into the House, the rules were so widely respected that there would be motions to strike a member's words, even if they just spoke in the second person and use the word you instead of the gentleman from so and so. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=91.0s)]
*  And so Marjorie Taylor Greene, her acting, you know, like the ogre in that role is not surprising. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=104.0s)]
*  What is surprising is Chairman Comer allowing that to be the conduct of and not just him, but every single Republican surprisingly, except for Representative Lauren Boebert, actually. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=113.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, the fact that she has been subject to so much vitriol herself may have to do, you know, may have something to do with the fact, you know, I don't know, but it could have something to do with the fact that as women, we understand the vitriol that especially happens. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=125.0s)]
*  And if you don't want to catch any, then you shouldn't give any. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=142.0s)]
*  And I think that's what Representative Greene encountered on Friday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=146.0s)]
*  If you don't want none, don't start none. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=151.0s)]
*  And if you're not going to respect the rules, then it's going to come to you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=153.0s)]
*  You have been very critical of the Biden administration's policy on Israel Gaza, although quite also strenuous in your endorsement of the Biden Harris ticket and the importance of lacking sort of balancing those two at the top of the list of priorities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=158.0s)]
*  Are there specific actions, specific things the Biden administration is not doing now that it should be doing that they have under their control? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=174.0s)]
*  I think this right here is an excellent question because there are things that are within our control when it comes to the bombardment and the outright famine that has happened, that is precipitating in Gaza and unfolding genocide in Gaza. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=183.0s)]
*  And there are things that are not in our control that the Netanyahu government is just barreling ahead towards. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=197.0s)]
*  For example, I do not believe that it is constructive to invite Prime Minister Netanyahu to a joint address of Congress. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=204.0s)]
*  And many foreign leaders use this opportunity to lobby the entire Congress and the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=211.0s)]
*  government for their own needs or for a certain view of their priorities. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=217.0s)]
*  And I don't believe that that's a constructive role for us to be playing right now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=225.0s)]
*  I believe that we should be more thorough in enforcing a red line at RAFA. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=229.0s)]
*  I believe that while there was one individual weapons transfer that was blocked, I think that we could be doing more to be investigating this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=233.0s)]
*  I believe that the sanctions with respect to the West Bank, we want to make sure that we are fully enforcing each and every one of the laws that we already have on the books to the fullest extent possible [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=241.0s)]
*  in order to rein in the aggression, as well as I think the extraordinary incentive that the Netanyahu administration has to continue its campaign in RAFA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=254.0s)]
*  They themselves have their own political pressures that they are responding to. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=265.0s)]
*  And I think that is both domestic and international. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=268.0s)]
*  And we have to make sure that we're not playing into that hand either. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=271.0s)]
*  I want to ask you the last question about the International Criminal Court, which is related to this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=274.0s)]
*  Obviously, you mentioned Netanyahu. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=278.0s)]
*  There was an arrest warrant issued for him and the head of Hamas, the mastermind of the military wing of Hamas, Sinwar, who oversaw the operation on October 7th. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=280.0s)]
*  There was bipartisan calls in the Senate to work on legislation to essentially sanction the International Criminal Court for that arrest warrant towards Netanyahu, not towards Sinwar. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=291.0s)]
*  Anthony Blinken said that he would be amenable to working with a bipartisan group of senators to come up with legislation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=303.0s)]
*  Would you be interested in bipartisan legislation to sanction the International Criminal Court for its arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=309.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. Absolutely not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=316.0s)]
*  I would associate myself with some of our strongest allies, as well as other members even within the United States Congress, that assert and respect the independence of the courts, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=319.0s)]
*  the independence of the ICC. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=332.0s)]
*  And what I find particularly disturbing about this attack on the ICC is that there is no particular set of evidence that has been presented by any member of any party as to any sort of reason why the ICC's conclusions are wrong or corrupted [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=334.0s)]
*  or why the process may or may not have legitimacy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=355.0s)]
*  And the fact that we are simply attacking a court because we do not like its conclusion without any evidence to support that case creates, I think, an opening of hypocrisy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=359.0s)]
*  And it could potentially be a gift to adversaries of the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=373.0s)]
*  Because what prevents Putin, what prevents individuals from other and other authoritarians around the world from also disregarding an international body from trying to create accountability for war crimes anywhere else in the world? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=379.0s)]
*  We have a responsibility in this moment to advance democracy and shore up democracy, not just here at home, but in order to be an example of a functioning democracy and upholding structures of democracy globally. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=397.0s)]
*  And attacking the ICC is the exact opposite of what we should be doing right now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=411.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, thank you so much. Always a pleasure. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=417.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW2s_qKen0A&t=427.0s)]
