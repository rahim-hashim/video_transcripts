# Trump seeks revenge in Montana as Harris-Walz campaign surges
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s)
*  Donald Trump's polling lead in multiple swing states has evaporated as Republicans have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=0.0s)]
*  struggled to stem the momentum of the Harris Wall's campaign. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=4.68s)]
*  In the past, when he was on the younger side, Trump's response would have been simple, just [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=8.66s)]
*  get out there and do more TV and do more rallies. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=12.96s)]
*  But now the 78-year-old is hardly campaigning at all. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=16.44s)]
*  He's just compulsively posting angrily to social media and doing rambling press conferences [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=19.56s)]
*  like the one he did yesterday, although crucially from the comfort of literally his own house. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=25.2s)]
*  The Harris Wall's campaign is trolling Trump for it, saying in a press release that Donald [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=30.16s)]
*  Trump is too lazy to fight for anything but himself or leave his country club fine by us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=35.04s)]
*  Now, in fairness to the ex-president, he does have one campaign event scheduled for this week. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=40.68s)]
*  It's right there on the events page of Trump Vans. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  It is in deep red Montana, and it is tonight. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=48.64s)]
*  Sure enough, here's a live look of people waiting for Trump at that rally site in the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=52.0s)]
*  pivotal electoral bastion of Bozeman, Montana. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=56.24s)]
*  Why there? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=60.32s)]
*  Well, if you're feeling generous to Trump, you could say there is a genuinely competitive [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=61.32s)]
*  Senate race there, which was sort of what he suggested when a reporter asked about his [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=64.8s)]
*  light schedule yesterday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=69.2s)]
*  Actually, I'm going out to certain places to help certain senators get elected, not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=70.68s)]
*  even for me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=75.92s)]
*  I'm trying to help when I go out to Wyoming or when I go out to Montana, or I'm going [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=76.92s)]
*  to different places to help people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=80.84s)]
*  And I don't have to go there because I'm leading those states, as you know, by 35, 40, 50 points. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm leading by record numbers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=90.0s)]
*  I'm going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=91.84s)]
*  Now, among other things, is there a competitive Senate race in Wyoming that I missed? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=96.48s)]
*  Anyway, so the idea, if you believe Trump there, is that he's just that kind of guy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  Like, he doesn't even want to do it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of a pain, but he's just doing it with the kindness of his heart. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  Except, you won't be surprised to learn, that's not really the story here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=112.68s)]
*  There's another reason that has to do primarily with a guy who is not from Montana and has [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=116.08s)]
*  nothing to do with Montana. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=120.72s)]
*  And it's this guy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=122.6s)]
*  Absolutely, he's fit for duty. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=123.6s)]
*  I think he will remain fit for duty for the remainder of this term and even for the remainder [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=125.92s)]
*  of another term if he's elected. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=129.48s)]
*  Can you explain to me how a guy who eats McDonald's, fried chicken, all those diet cokes, and who [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=131.28s)]
*  never exercises is in as good of shape as you say he's in? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=136.8s)]
*  It's called genetics. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=140.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=141.2s)]
*  It's, some people have just great genes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=142.52s)]
*  I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  to be 200 years old. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=148.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=149.8s)]
*  But I would say the answer to your question is he has incredibly good genes and it's just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=150.8s)]
*  the way God made him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=153.44s)]
*  That was Ronnie Jackson, the Navy doctor acting as Trump's presidential physician back in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=155.36s)]
*  2018, when Trump was being incredibly cagey and in questions about his medical and cognitive [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  fitness. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=164.12s)]
*  Jackson has now become a far-right conspiracy-spewing MAGA congressman in Texas, but that wasn't [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=165.12s)]
*  always going to be his next job after the Navy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=170.8s)]
*  You see, back in 2018, Trump wanted to reward Jackson for raving about his virility and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=172.68s)]
*  health to the public. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=178.08s)]
*  And that reward was to nominate Jackson to be Secretary of Veteran Affairs, running the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=179.8s)]
*  $300 billion federal agency that provides crucial care and benefits to the nation's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=185.12s)]
*  military vets. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=189.84s)]
*  It was a surprise announcement and it quickly blew up in Trump's face. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=191.24s)]
*  After dozens of former colleagues came forward to allege that Jackson had misused prescription [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=195.4s)]
*  drugs, created a hostile work environment and been drunk on the job. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=200.04s)]
*  Those allegations were collected and investigated by the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=205.4s)]
*  its top Democrat, Senator John Tester of Montana. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=209.68s)]
*  I understand he had a nickname in the White House among some of the White House staff. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=214.84s)]
*  And it was the Candyman because he handed out prescription drugs like they were candy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=218.44s)]
*  The White House doctor's nickname among some people in the White House was the Candyman. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=224.28s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=227.84s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=228.84s)]
*  Tester was reticent to discuss the allegations, but they were so serious, he said, that they [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  could not be ignored. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=235.44s)]
*  I think what we've seen is a pattern of problems that people deserve to know. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=238.44s)]
*  I know a lot of folks have said mainly from the White House is, you know, we shouldn't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=245.32s)]
*  be doing this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Look, it would be senatorial malpractice for not for us not to follow up on this issue [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  and find out what kind of a person Ronnie Jackson is. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=256.12s)]
*  Chuck, I've never done this before. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=259.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=261.32s)]
*  I just want to get the best person to run the VA as possible because our veterans deserve [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=262.32s)]
*  that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  And these aren't my accusations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  These are accusations by active and retired military personnel that have come to us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=269.12s)]
*  We're just trying to follow up to make sure what's true and what's not. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=273.52s)]
*  To be clear, Senator Tester was not out there on his own. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=278.2s)]
*  In fact, he was supported by the Republican member, the ranking member of the Senate Veterans [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  Affairs Committee at the time, the chair, Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson, because they [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  all knew the allegations against Jackson were numerous and serious. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=290.2s)]
*  And eventually the military would agree. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=294.76s)]
*  The Pentagon released an investigation that concluded Jackson disparaged, belittled, bullied [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  and humiliated his subordinates, that he engaged in inappropriate conduct involving the use [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  of alcohol, that he took Ambien while he was on duty. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=306.08s)]
*  Offenses bad enough, the Navy demoted him and ranked to captain after he had retired. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  By then, Jackson had withdrawn from consideration as VA secretary and launched a successful [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  campaign for Congress as a kind of Trump acolyte. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=320.88s)]
*  Trump did not forget. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  He was so incensed that he couldn't just install one of his biggest cheerleaders as the head [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  of the VA. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=330.28s)]
*  He swore a vendetta against Senator John Tester, who was up for reelection that year. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=331.28s)]
*  When I watch what John Tester of Montana, a state that I won by like over 20 points, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=336.32s)]
*  really, they love me and I love them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=343.12s)]
*  And I want to tell you that John Tester, I think this is going to cause him a lot of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=346.32s)]
*  problems for him to be doing this to this man and this family. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=351.76s)]
*  I think John Tester has to have a big price to pay in Montana because I don't think people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=356.12s)]
*  in Montana, the Admiral is the kind of person that they respect and admire and they don't [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=361.72s)]
*  like seeing what's happened. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=367.84s)]
*  The captain, in point of fact. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=371.12s)]
*  Despite Trump's efforts, John Tester won his reelection bid in 2018. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=373.08s)]
*  Six years later, Tester is running for reelection again. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=377.24s)]
*  Again, it's uphill battle, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=379.72s)]
*  It is Trump country, at least at the statewide level of the presidential. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  This week, Trump is going to Montana and only Montana to campaign against the Democratic [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=386.5s)]
*  senator that he blames for sinking Ronny Jackson's chance to do Trump's bidding at the VA. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=391.44s)]
*  You can't get the guy off the golf course to campaign for his own reelection. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=398.12s)]
*  He's not out there stumping with his own vice presidential candidate who's doing his whole [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=402.88s)]
*  like stalker tour. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  He is only doing press conferences from the comfort of his own house at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=408.0s)]
*  The only thing that gets this 78-year-old man on a plane and on the campaign trail is [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=412.66s)]
*  one event is a revenge tour. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=417.2s)]
*  If you have any question about what would power a second Trump term, think about this. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=421.16s)]
*  What will rouse an increasingly slow 78-year-old man to action? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=425.72s)]
*  The answer appears to be pure spite. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844KnIO8Y6s&t=430.48s)]
