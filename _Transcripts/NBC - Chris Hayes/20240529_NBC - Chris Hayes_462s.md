# ‘Shocking’, ‘Absurd’ Chief Justice Roberts urged to act as Supreme Court scandals mount
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE)
*  So today we finally heard from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Leto in the form of two letters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=0.0s)]
*  he sent to members of Congress. He explained why two flags associated with the insurrection [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=4.32s)]
*  flew at his two homes, refused their request to recuse from current cases related to Donald [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=9.08s)]
*  Trump and January 6th before the court. There is one key figure we have not heard from yet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=13.72s)]
*  That's the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who has said nothing about the mirrored scandals [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=18.96s)]
*  that are undermining Americans' confidence in his court. Roberts has not responded to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=23.32s)]
*  two top Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee who wrote him last week asking he [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=28.88s)]
*  ensure Leto recuses himself and requesting a meeting as soon as possible to discuss other [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=32.84s)]
*  steps to quote address the Supreme Court's ethics crisis. Congressman Dan Goldman is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=37.76s)]
*  a Democrat in New York. He, along with Congressman Hank Johnson, authored a letter to Justice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=42.64s)]
*  Leto calling on him to recuse. The letter was signed by 43 of his colleagues and he [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=46.16s)]
*  joins me now. Well, you got a response. Yeah. What is your response to the response? It's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=51.28s)]
*  pretty shocking. The fact that Justice Leto thinks that he can be the judge and jury of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=58.36s)]
*  his own impartiality flies in the face of Supreme Court precedent, flies in the face [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=65.56s)]
*  of the Constitution, flies in the face of federal law and completely misapplies the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=70.96s)]
*  standard that he is supposed to be applying, even given the fact that there's no binding [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=77.12s)]
*  code of ethics on him and he essentially gets to decide this himself. But the standard [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=84.6s)]
*  is whether a reasonable person or whether a person could reasonably think that he has [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  some degree of bias or partiality. It is not whether he does or doesn't. Right. It is whether [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=97.96s)]
*  it is reasonable for someone to conclude that he has an appearance of a conflict of interest [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  and for him to actually say in this letter that it is completely unreasonable for anyone [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=113.36s)]
*  to think that when he flies a stop the steal flag or a stop the steal flag is flying from [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  his home, that that somehow is not reasonable 11 days after or the January 6th to think [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=127.08s)]
*  that he has some political bias about a case related to stop the steal that flag in January [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  6th is just bewildering. Yeah. I mean, his argument is my wife did all this and she's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=142.52s)]
*  an independent woman who has she co-owns her house. He says at one point in the letter, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=150.68s)]
*  I can't you know, she has a she has a right to do whatever she wants, you know, the property. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=154.12s)]
*  So I can't control it at all. And therefore no reasonable person unless someone with an [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  ideological bias could think that I have to recuse therefore I won't. But at a deeper [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=164.08s)]
*  constitutional level, it seems to me that again, all this stuff is pointing towards this real [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=169.36s)]
*  sort of constitutional standoff between the branches. I mean, their assertion, the court's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  current assertion is you can't make us do anything. We are an independent branch and no one can make [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=178.0s)]
*  us recuse about anything. And like you should go take a long walk off or short peer congressman. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, right. I mean, that's really what they think. One hundred percent, which is baffling, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=187.4s)]
*  given the jurisdiction that Congress has conferred on the Supreme Court, the funding that we give to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  the judiciary as a co-equal branch, we obviously have oversight and leverage over the Supreme Court. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=198.64s)]
*  Otherwise, we don't have co-equal branches of government. But even under the Supreme Court's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=206.72s)]
*  precedent itself recently, a judge's spouse is sufficient to implicate a judge in whatever [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  conflict of interest there may be. This is not old hundred year old. This was Justice Kennedy [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=221.28s)]
*  and Jamie Raskin, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, has a terrific op-ed in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=227.28s)]
*  the New York Times, which really goes through the actual case law as to why it is not just up to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=231.68s)]
*  Justice Alito and the Supreme Court with their non-binding advisory code of ethics, unlike every [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=238.48s)]
*  other judge in the land, but that they are actually required to recuse if in a circumstance like this, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=245.68s)]
*  there is an obvious and reasonable appearance of a conflict of interest. It doesn't have to be an [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=253.6s)]
*  actual conflict. An appearance is enough. And it is absurd for Justice Alito and frankly, Justice [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=259.04s)]
*  Thomas as well, given that his wife was involved, gave testimony to the January 6th committee, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=265.44s)]
*  and was involved texting Mark Meadows related to the same conduct, the same facts that are before [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=270.4s)]
*  this court in two cases. It's not just that they have a bias toward Donald Trump. So any executive [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=277.92s)]
*  action that Donald Trump made, you would do. It is the same factual pattern that is before the court [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=283.52s)]
*  that if you believe Justice Alito, both of their spouses made political statements about. That [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  is obvious. And at a minimum, it is reasonable to think that there is an appearance. Yeah, there's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=297.2s)]
*  obviously the federal criminal case against Donald Trump for his conduct up to, you know, in the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=304.08s)]
*  aftermath of the election up to January 6th. There's also this Fisher case before the court [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=309.2s)]
*  about one of the charges, which is conspiracy to obstruct official proceeding, which is before the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=314.0s)]
*  court as well. I guess the next question is, it is notable to me, you guys wrote to Alito, right, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=320.08s)]
*  on the House side. The Senate judiciary wrote to Roberts, and they got a letter back from Alito, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  which itself is kind of wild. Look, I mean, they didn't write to Alito. They wrote to Roberts. They [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=334.64s)]
*  got a letter back from Alito. It's like, okay, Justice Roberts, you're the person who comes [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=340.4s)]
*  before the court annually when he does, you know, when he comes before Congress to ask for funding, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=344.08s)]
*  whatever, like we want to talk to you. And so far, nothing. It underscores the problem that the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=348.4s)]
*  Supreme Court has right now, which is that technically Chief Justice Roberts doesn't [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=354.64s)]
*  actually have any authority over Justice Alito to require him to recuse, other than as part of a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=360.4s)]
*  larger court decision, if there were to be a request. But what is shocking about this is that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=369.28s)]
*  we are now about on the precipice of an irreparable, harmful decision by two justices who, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=379.76s)]
*  to any other federal judge in the country, would recuse. And it is up to Chief Justice Roberts [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  to save the court's legitimacy right now. And for him to not respond to Senator Durbin and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=396.96s)]
*  Senator Whitehouse, and instead for Alito to respond to them, is truly flouting Congress's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=403.6s)]
*  oversight authority and Congress's role as a co-equal branch. And it does not bode well for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=410.8s)]
*  what is to come over the next few weeks, when I think the biggest travesty in Supreme Court history [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=416.72s)]
*  may occur if these two justices rule on cases about which they are clearly conflicted. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=422.8s)]
*  I mean, I think Plessy and Korematsu is still... [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=429.12s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  The biggest ethical... [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=434.0s)]
*  Yes, okay. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=435.04s)]
*  The biggest ethical... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  I just want to be clear on that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=436.32s)]
*  Ethical tragedy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=437.92s)]
*  Congressman Dan Goldman, it's great to have you. Thank you very much. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss4Scrr4_KE&t=459.04s)]
