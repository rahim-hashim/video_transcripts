# What’s most ‘disturbing’ about Justice Alito’s flags
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It has now been just over 24 hours since reporting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=0.0s)]
*  by the New York Times revealed that a flag championed by the far-right Christian National's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=5.16s)]
*  movement, a flag displayed widely by January 6th insurrectionists as a storm the capital [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=9.84s)]
*  for Donald Trump, also flew all summer long last year over the beach house of Supreme [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Court Justice Samuel Alito. And of course, that news about that flag came just days after [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=20.7s)]
*  Alito's home in Virginia also displayed an upside down American flag in the weeks after [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=26.7s)]
*  the violent sacking of the Capitol. Another symbol adopted and embraced by Trump's Stop [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=32.46s)]
*  the Seal supporters. In that case, Alito responded to questions from the Times with an emailed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  statement saying his wife, you know, the wife, hoisted that inverted flag in a dispute with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  their liberal neighbors. Why doesn't say but in the days since news of this second right-wing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=50.58s)]
*  flag broke, there has been no response from Alito, no response from the court or its chief [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=56.58s)]
*  justice John Roberts, who now faces a growing chorus of voices calling for him to appear [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=61.26s)]
*  before Congress and explain the conduct of the members of his court. That is in addition [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=66.5s)]
*  to calls for Alito at a minimum to recuse himself from two hugely consequential January [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=72.68s)]
*  6 related cases sitting before the Supreme Court over his explicit and obvious violations of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=79.3s)]
*  regulations on judicial conduct. If Justice Alito does not recuse himself from the Trump [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=85.46000000000001s)]
*  immunity case in the Fisher January 6 case, he will do irreparable damage to the Supreme [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=92.66s)]
*  Court. He definitively needs to recuse himself. Well, of course he should recuse himself from [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=98.94s)]
*  these cases at a very minimum. He has to recuse himself. He should recuse himself from any Trump [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=105.54s)]
*  related cases. Now, all this is happening on a day when the Supreme Court was open for business [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=111.86000000000001s)]
*  handing down decisions on cases. It heard this spring. It was possible they might even [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  announce some action on one of those cases that people say Trump that Alito should recuse [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=121.86000000000001s)]
*  from Donald Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution for his attempts to overturn the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=127.06s)]
*  2020 election. Now, that's a case that the high court has sat on for months. In fact, check this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=132.46s)]
*  out. It has now been 164 days, nearly half a year since special counsel Jack Smith asked the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=137.74s)]
*  justices to weigh in immediately on Trump's immunity claims, saying basically, look, I know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=145.86s)]
*  the Supreme Court's going to want to weigh on this and the American voting public has a right [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=151.58s)]
*  to know the outcome of Trump's case before the 2024 election. And the court rejected that request [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  and they waited and they are slow walking their decision now. So here we are now, nearly half a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  year later. It's harder and harder to think that someone like Sam Alito, whose household flew [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  flags supporting the insurrection over not one but two of his houses, is in any way qualified to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  be a person who makes judgments on these cases. The court did not announce a ruling today in the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=179.06s)]
*  immunity case. Who knows when and if they ever will. But the 6-3 conservative majority, the same [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=185.06s)]
*  conservative majority that destroyed abortion rights and DABs, the majority that now boasts [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=191.26s)]
*  multiple members who have flagrantly violated basic judicial ethics, covering everything from [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  undeclared gifts to obvious conflicts of interest to open politicking, all of which apply to all the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=199.98s)]
*  federal judges below the Supreme Court, that majority threw open the floodgates for Republican [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=205.62s)]
*  led racial gerrymandering schemes. Court conservatives this time sided with a redistricting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=210.14s)]
*  plan by South Carolina Republicans that pulled thousands of black voters out of a key battleground [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  district. In a decision that was authored by Samuel Alito, the majority agreed with those Republicans. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  They weren't trying to disenfranchise voters of color. They were trying to disenfranchise Democrats [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=228.22s)]
*  and whoopsie, most of them happen to be black. See how that works? It's a decision that will make it easier [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=234.22s)]
*  for Republicans to box out voters of color as long as they can argue their gerrymandering is based on [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=242.22s)]
*  political identity first and race second. A ruling that endangers the basic principle of one person, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=247.46s)]
*  one vote. Another act of right-wing steamrolling that is the apotheosis of what the Trump era has [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=253.86s)]
*  wrought. We keep learning more daily about just how unaccountable they are. When a justice like [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=260.18s)]
*  Samuel Alito flies this pro-insurrectionist flag, right-wing flag, not once but twice over his homes, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=266.86s)]
*  the same flag flown by billionaire Republican donor Leonard Leo, who not only handpicked Trump's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  Supreme Court nominees, but also Alito and Thomas, and then proceeded to give both of them hundreds [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=279.58s)]
*  of thousands of dollars in gifts or at least facilitate those and trips in recent years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=284.02s)]
*  They're all part of the same club. I'm just a judge. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito didn't have to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=290.42s)]
*  fly those flags to be a true conservative friend of the Trump agenda. This is what sticks with me, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=296.02s)]
*  right? Think about this. I mean, Samuel Alito is one of the most powerful reactionaries in the country, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  arguably the most. His court opinions, speeches, media appearances, he could just do that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=308.1s)]
*  Why did he fly the flags? He had to go an extra step and advertise. Take that flag in his vacation [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=314.18s)]
*  home, right? It's a signal from Alito about who he thinks he answers to. He knows he's not supposed [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=323.14s)]
*  to do that. He knows any other judge would get in trouble. You can't do that. But he thinks he [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=328.74s)]
*  answers to no one. We'll see if he's right. The minimum that suggests a disturbing readiness to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=334.34s)]
*  keep pushing past any boundaries as the movement that Alito is clearly a member of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=341.14s)]
*  looks to destroy the current American constitutional order. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Dy6eXBuCg&t=346.18s)]
