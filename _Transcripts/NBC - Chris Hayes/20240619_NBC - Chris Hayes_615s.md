# Ex-SCOTUS clerk: ‘Something is rotten at the court’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It is that time of year when Donald Trump's right-wing Supreme Court waits until the very end of the term to bludgeon us with their decisions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  There are 21 opinions remaining, but we are all holding our breath for one in particular that has a kind of clock ticking. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=9.0s)]
*  Of course, that is Trump v. United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=17.0s)]
*  The former president's claim that he is immune from being criminally prosecuted for anything he did while he was in the White House. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=20.0s)]
*  Now, all of the justices are, you know, adult grown human beings who can read the newspaper and know that time is of the essence in this case. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=27.0s)]
*  We are less than five months away from the election when Donald Trump will have, if you look at polls now, basically a 50-50 shot at taking back the Oval Office. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=35.0s)]
*  But at every turn, this court, the conservative majority of this court, one has to imagine, has dragged its feet. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=43.0s)]
*  The federal case against Donald Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election charges him with four felony counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=51.0s)]
*  It has been on hold for more than six months. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=60.0s)]
*  The judge in that case, Federal District Judge Tonya Chutkin, was forced to pause the case all the way back on December 13th of last year amid Trump's immunity appeal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=64.0s)]
*  That was 189 days ago. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=74.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court finally agreed to take up the case on February 28th. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=77.0s)]
*  They heard arguments at the end of April and we are still waiting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=81.0s)]
*  112 days have passed with nothing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=85.0s)]
*  No decision from the Supreme Court, no movement towards a trial that could hold Donald Trump accountable for his attempted insurrection, and also demonstrate to voters whether the man is guilty or not guilty of the grave crimes with which he is charged. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=89.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, as we've often said on this show, the wheels of justice do move slowly, but this is not normal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=104.0s)]
*  As law professor Leah Lippman puts it in an opinion piece in New York Times today, something's rotten about the justices taking so long on Trump's immunity case. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=110.0s)]
*  She goes on to explain, quote, Mr. Trump's lawyers put together a set of arguments that are so outlandish they shouldn't take much time to dispatch. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=119.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal also notes that this term as a whole, the whole Supreme Court term, is moving at a historically slow pace. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=126.0s)]
*  Quote, according to Adam Feldman, creator of the Empirical SCOTUS blog, the justices are completing decisions at the second slowest rate since the 1946 term. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=134.0s)]
*  Now, keep in mind each justice has a team of four very bright and industrious law clerks assisting them, and they only work nine months out of the year. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=146.0s)]
*  It's also really worth remembering the last time the Supreme Court heard a case this pressing, the direct analog. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=155.0s)]
*  It involved a corrupt Republican president. It was in 1974. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=162.0s)]
*  It had United States in the title, United States versus Nixon. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=166.0s)]
*  And that, of course, was when then sitting President Nixon claimed he was immune from complying with a subpoena in the Watergate investigation because of executive privilege. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=170.0s)]
*  In that case, the Supreme Court managed to move much more expeditiously. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=181.0s)]
*  Good evening. The U.S. Supreme Court acting as swiftly as it ever has today announced it will review the special Watergate prosecutors complaint against President Nixon. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=187.0s)]
*  It was just one week ago today when Leon Jaworski asked the court to rule on the president's defiance of a subpoena for more White House tapes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=198.0s)]
*  It was yesterday when the president's lawyer asked the court not to rush to judgment and allow the case to be heard in the Court of Appeals. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=207.0s)]
*  But this afternoon, the court said it would hear oral arguments in about five weeks, which set the stage for a possible confrontation between the president and the high court on the issue of executive privilege. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=215.0s)]
*  At 330, the weekly conference ended. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=227.0s)]
*  Ten minutes later, the chief justice issued a single sheet of paper setting in motion the biggest constitutional test of presidential power since the Civil War. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=230.0s)]
*  In the case now entitled United States of America versus Richard Nixon president, the court agreed to settle the question whether the president can be compelled to furnish evidence to the Watergate special prosecutor. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=239.0s)]
*  Bypassing the Court of Appeals, the court said brief should be submitted June 21st and replies July 1st. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=251.0s)]
*  The historic argument was set for July 8th. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=259.0s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=262.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court of the United States today heard three hours of arguments that could very well determine President Nixon's chances of staying in office for a full term. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=263.0s)]
*  There were two principal questions before the court, whether Mr. Nixon can be forced to give up an additional 64 White House tapes to the special prosecutor and whether the federal grand jury was within its jurisdiction when it named the president an unindicted co-conspirator. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=271.0s)]
*  The thrust of the argument centered on the release of the additional tapes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=287.0s)]
*  A decision is expected in a week or two. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=290.0s)]
*  Even before this morning's argument, one justice was writing and circulating his ideas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=292.0s)]
*  Another had his clerk prepare a draft opinion. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=297.0s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=300.0s)]
*  President Nixon has not yet responded to the sledgehammer decision of the Supreme Court today, which ruled that he must immediately turn over tapes of 64 presidential conversations. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=301.0s)]
*  In a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the court rejected eight to nothing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=312.0s)]
*  Mr. Nixon's claim of absolute privilege on those tapes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=318.0s)]
*  The court said the president's claim of absolute privilege would upset the constitutional balance of a workable government. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=322.0s)]
*  It said its ruling was only that the president had to give way in criminal proceedings, a very limited intrusion since presidents would rarely be involved in criminal cases. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=328.0s)]
*  So five decades ago, the court took less than two months to decide President Nixon's case. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=338.0s)]
*  They agreed to hear the case on May 31st, 1974. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=343.0s)]
*  You see it there. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=347.0s)]
*  They gave each set of lawyers three weeks to file their briefs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=348.0s)]
*  Then 10 days after that to reply. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=350.0s)]
*  The court heard oral arguments on July 8th and just 16 days later, just over two weeks, they issued their unanimous opinion, rejecting President Nixon's claim of executive privilege in total from start to finish. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=352.0s)]
*  All done in 54 days. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=366.0s)]
*  Just 54 days to decide Richard Nixon's case. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=368.0s)]
*  And we are still waiting for the outcome of Donald Trump's after 112 days and counting. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=371.0s)]
*  These are similar cases with similar urgency. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=377.0s)]
*  President Nixon was making a completely a historical unconstitutional claim of immunity because he did not want to turn over his tapes in the Watergate investigation. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=381.0s)]
*  The court ruled no, the president is not a king and does not get to ignore the laws. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=390.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is once again arguing the president is a kind of king, that he can do anything and everything, including ordering the assassination of his political rivals and not face prosecution unless impeached and convicted. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=394.0s)]
*  And yet the court drags its feet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=406.0s)]
*  Members of that court, all of them, knowing full well, every day they delay makes it less and less possible that Trump will stand trial for the insurrection before this next election. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=409.0s)]
*  Leah Lippman is the author of that New York Times Outbed. She's a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and co-host of the Strict Scrutiny podcast along with Melissa Murray and my wife, Kate Shaw, and she joins me now. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=419.0s)]
*  It's great to see you, Leah. I love this piece, partly because you just walked through the timeline, which inspired us to do so as well. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=429.0s)]
*  Why do you not think there's a good faith explanation here that it's complex or that this court is moving slowly because they have weird, there's some weird factional battles happening behind the scenes? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=437.0s)]
*  I think this court has lost the benefit of the doubt and the presumption of good faith for any number of reasons. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=451.0s)]
*  One is that they are more than capable of acting quickly, even in difficult cases where there is disagreement. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=456.0s)]
*  The Trump disqualification case arising out of Colorado, where the Colorado state court took him off the ballot, that resulted in a divided opinion. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=462.0s)]
*  Yet the court still was able to get it out before Super Tuesday, before people went to cast their ballots, and within a month of the oral argument. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=470.0s)]
*  Here, there might well be division, and yet the court has taken two months since oral argument. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=477.0s)]
*  And the arguments in the case, I think, are way more outlandish than any of the arguments on behalf of disqualifying a president who participated in the January 6th insurrection. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=483.0s)]
*  You add to that all of the indications of the justices, let's say extracurricular activities like Justice Alito flying multiple stop the steal flags associated at his house. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=492.0s)]
*  And all of that, I think, is more than enough indication that this court just cannot be trusted to actually follow the rules and adhere to the legal process when it comes to cases involving Donald Trump. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=502.0s)]
*  That point about the Colorado case is great. I had totally forgotten that time frame, right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=513.0s)]
*  So in there, the clock that's ticking is they've got to print the ballots, I think, for Colorado. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=518.0s)]
*  They were going to actually vote. They were going to send them out to mail them. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=523.0s)]
*  And of course, the notion was if we don't act, he's not going to be in the ballot, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=527.0s)]
*  So the sort of constraining thing they had to do was like, if we don't act quickly, Donald Trump won't be on the ballot. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=531.0s)]
*  In this, it's totally flipped. If we don't act, then nothing happens to our guy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=538.0s)]
*  And they seem to be taking longer. Yes, that's exactly right. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=543.0s)]
*  And I think if you go back to the oral argument in the Trump immunity case, you saw the Republican justices attempt to interject basically every other possibility into this case. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=548.0s)]
*  Aside from the case, they were actually being asked to decide. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=558.0s)]
*  So Justice Alito, for example, floated the possibility to the special counsel's office. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=561.0s)]
*  Well, what if a president just made a mistake? Could he prosecuted then as if the stop the steal movement was just some kind of oopsie that the president had engaged in or the former president had engaged in for the last two months? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=566.0s)]
*  I mean, this case doesn't involve a simple mistake. And if you look back to the Nixon case there, the Supreme Court basically said we don't have to resolve absolutely everything related to immunity. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=576.0s)]
*  All we have to say is presidents aren't immune from criminal process based on some generalized definition of confidentiality. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi6_3h5xA7Y&t=586.0s)]
