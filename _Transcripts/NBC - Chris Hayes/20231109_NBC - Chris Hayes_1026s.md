# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Nov. 8
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw)
*  That was how Ivanka Trump, former senior White House advisor, former executive vice president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=0.0s)]
*  of development and acquisitions of the Trump organization, and daughter of Donald Trump [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=18.48s)]
*  was greeted as she entered a downtown Manhattan courthouse this morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=22.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's eldest daughter is the fourth and final member of her family to testify [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=25.76s)]
*  in the $250 million civil fraud trial against her father and his business. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  Now, Ivanka Trump, unlike her brothers, is not a defendant, and that's due to the statute [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=35.2s)]
*  of limitations, and she took the stand today as a reluctant witness for the New York attorney general. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=39.68s)]
*  Michael Cohen worked as Donald Trump's personal lawyer and self-described fixer for a decade [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=44.96s)]
*  before going to prison for taking part in a legal hush money scheme Trump was indicted for earlier [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=49.2s)]
*  this year, separate from his civil fraud lawsuit. Cohen is the host of the May Oculp podcast, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=54.32s)]
*  cohost of the political beatdown podcast, author of Revenge, How Donald Trump Weaponized the U.S. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=58.96s)]
*  Department of Justice Against Its Critics, and he joins me now. Let's start first, Michael, with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=63.28s)]
*  Ivanka Trump's role in the family business. She, because of statute of limitations, is not in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=70.8s)]
*  same boat as her brothers. Can you describe her level, where she fit in the sort of word chart to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=77.28s)]
*  the extent there was one? Well, there definitely was. Of course, Donald was the absolute top of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=83.52s)]
*  the org chart. And then, of course, to the left of that, if we were putting this into a diagram, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=90.72s)]
*  would be Don, Ivanka, and Eric. Now, who really ran that specific group as part of the executive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=96.64s)]
*  vice president? And that would be Ivanka. Don, even though older than Ivanka, would take a lot [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=104.24s)]
*  of direction from her, because, as everybody would acknowledge, she is Donald's favorite. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=111.84s)]
*  And then, of course, Eric, being the youngest, would, of course, listen as well. But the three [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  of them, Don, Ivanka, and Eric, each and every week, would have their own private family meeting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  where they would distribute which projects each one would do and in what aspect that they would [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=133.04s)]
*  be involved. Now, one of the, I should say two of the issues that were brought up on trial today, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=141.12s)]
*  and she was questioned on the stand, was, of course, the old post office and the Doral Golf [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=148.8s)]
*  Resort, both of which Ivanka was the point person on. And both of those are involved in Tish James's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=154.4s)]
*  questioning, or I should say the prosecutors on behalf of Tish James's questioning. So she is as [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=162.96s)]
*  high up as anybody could be, but just slightly below her father. Do you, there has been a sort [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=169.28s)]
*  of after the January 6th, the White House, right? What appears to be a transparent attempt to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=177.04s)]
*  distance herself from her father, I don't think it's particularly successful because everyone knows [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=183.68s)]
*  who she is, that seems different than the brothers. Is that a fair read? Yeah, that is definitely a fair [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=188.0s)]
*  read. I'll tell you what else is a fair read is that the sketch artist certainly did a better job [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=195.44s)]
*  on Ivanka and Don and Eric, even Donald than she did on me. But putting that aside, right? I mean, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't even know who she was starring when she was drawing me, but putting that aside, yes, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=208.48s)]
*  yes, absolutely. First of all, she's trying to distance herself because it's not the look that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=213.76s)]
*  she wants to portray, not certainly in Indian Creek, there in Miami where they're having a very [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=220.32s)]
*  rough time in terms of meeting people, setting up play dates for their kids, getting into the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=226.48s)]
*  country clubs that she thought that she would be easily admitted to. There's a section, one of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  things that's happening here, and I think you have unique insight to share, is the approach of the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=240.72s)]
*  lawyers here. Now these are, you know, Chris Kye is a serious lawyer with a serious resume, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=245.2s)]
*  and he's done this before. There has been a lot of combatedness by this legal team towards the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=249.2s)]
*  judge today. Again, once again, going back and forth on a regional little piece from the NBC News [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  reporting on this. This is the lawyer, Chris Kye, saying that the questions about Ivanka's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=260.88s)]
*  endowment in that deal you just mentioned, that's the old post office in Washington, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=266.24s)]
*  D.C. in a hotel, were irrelevant because of the statute of limitations issue. Note of the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=269.44s)]
*  government agency involved in the talks was happy with it. They were thrilled with the renovation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=273.44s)]
*  It was a world-class facility, he said, and the judge, Ongoran, replied, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=277.76s)]
*  you're starting to sound like your client. Why does everyone who works for him start [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=281.36s)]
*  sounding like him no matter what they sounded like before? It's weird. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=286.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's not weird. It's actually part of the job. He tells you what he wants you to say. It's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  not as if Chris Kye came up with this on his own. There are talking points, and if you don't hit the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=298.08s)]
*  talking points that Donald wants, you're fired. That's exactly what Chris Kye is doing. But he's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=304.0s)]
*  not the only belligerent lawyer on behalf of Donald. You also have Alina Haber, who, of course, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=310.72s)]
*  the second that she gets an opportunity to be in front of a microphone and a camera, she's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=317.6s)]
*  parroting Donald as if she is Donald, which is great. I mean, the only thing that she didn't say, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=323.76s)]
*  today she came out once again attacking me as if that's going to be the end-all, be-all, as others [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=329.28s)]
*  have called it, the Perry Mason moment. The case is over because she tries to disparage me. I mean, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=336.32s)]
*  it's like Alina Haber's looking for the case of the missing pillow case, and it just doesn't do [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=343.76s)]
*  anything for this specific other than embarrass herself, embarrass her client, and sort of make a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  mockery of the whole proceeding. I want to ask you a question that's parallel to this, because [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=355.84s)]
*  it's about something I just talked to Eric Holder about, and you talked about this before, which is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=361.2s)]
*  the sort of vision to fully sort of bring the Department of Justice into the orbit of the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=365.44s)]
*  president and use it as fully an instrument of political retribution or reward by the sitting [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=371.2s)]
*  president. To the extent there are examples of that, and there clearly are, right, where Trump [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=377.2s)]
*  was ordering Jeff Sessions to do things. The one clearest-cut example seems to be him [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=382.0s)]
*  intervening and Bill Barr intervening specifically in your case before DOJ, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=389.2s)]
*  specifically about whether you're on release. You basically experience the small version of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=394.0s)]
*  what he's promising for the rest of the country. Oh, I don't know if I would call it small. I was [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=398.64s)]
*  unconstitutionally remanded back to Otisville because I refused to waive my First Amendment [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=403.92s)]
*  constitutional right in a document that they wanted me to sign that was prepared specifically [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=410.88s)]
*  for me. In fact, the case is on appeal December 14th at the courthouse, the Thoroughgood Marshall [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=417.36s)]
*  Appellate Courthouse in New York, where we certainly expect... I am, and Donald made me, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=423.28s)]
*  the very first political prisoner held by this country for failing to waive a First Amendment [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=429.52s)]
*  constitutional right. Now, let me be very clear about something. I won't be the last if, in fact, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=435.44s)]
*  he gets into office. I will just be the first. And he is... Don't take it from me. Listen to what [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=442.08s)]
*  Donald is telling you that he's going to do. The first thing he said, he's going to rewrite the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=450.24s)]
*  constitution. He's going to strip the legislature and the judiciary of their tripartite power and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=454.56s)]
*  confer everything to the executive branch, which is who? It's him. And he will come after everyone, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=463.36s)]
*  including yourself, Chris. Anyone that angered him, anyone that bothered him, I'm going to go [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=470.56s)]
*  for my retribution. That's all he's saying. Don't take my word. Listen. Listen to what he's saying. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=477.44s)]
*  He's promising. Whether it could deliver, I don't know, but he's definitely promising it. We'll see. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=482.88s)]
*  I think the Department of Justice is a fulcrum that is much more easily wielded than a constitutional [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  rewrite. Michael Cohen, as always, a pleasure, sir. Thank you very much. Good to see you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=492.0s)]
*  I will not be silenced, and I will not let you distort my words. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=499.04s)]
*  I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=502.88s)]
*  We are human beings. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=522.72s)]
*  Just like anyone else, the cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=528.24s)]
*  Why what I don't understand is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you all. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=535.52s)]
*  Last night, 22 House Democrats joined with the Republican majority to censure the only [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=544.24s)]
*  Palestinian American in Congress, Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. The resolution [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=548.56s)]
*  accused the congressman of, quote, promoting false narratives regarding the October 7th, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  2023 Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=557.76s)]
*  The congresswoman denies these accusations. The resolution also objects to a passage [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=562.64s)]
*  in a video she released earlier this month that calls on President Joe Biden to support a ceasefire [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=567.04s)]
*  in Gaza, specifically a segment of that video that depicted protesters in Tlaib's home state of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=571.3599999999999s)]
*  Michigan chanting the phrase you see there from the river to the sea. Now the resolution called [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=576.48s)]
*  that chant, which is commonly used by some pro-Palestinian activists, quote, a genocidal [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=581.2s)]
*  call to violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people and to replace it with a Palestinian [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=586.16s)]
*  state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. In a statement, Congresswoman [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=591.04s)]
*  Tlaib rejected that characterization, instead calling it, quote, an aspirational call for [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=595.84s)]
*  freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate. And Congresswoman [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=600.8s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib joins me now. Congresswoman, thank you for coming on tonight. I just want to start by [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=606.56s)]
*  asking what your conversations with your Democratic colleagues have been like over the last 24 hours, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=611.12s)]
*  particularly if you've talked to any of the 22 that voted for the censure resolution. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, many of my colleagues know I have an open door policy. They can come and talk to me [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=621.92s)]
*  about this. And they know the conversation will lead in me urging them to please save as many lives [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=627.2s)]
*  as possible. And that means calling for a ceasefire. Again, my colleagues know where my heart is, and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=632.88s)]
*  they know that I have been pushing from day one of coexistence of the days where both my grandparents, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=638.32s)]
*  when they were born there, that there was coexistence among all faiths living in peace. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=644.72s)]
*  And much of what I'm seeing is distortion of my words, also in trying to silence my residents who [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=651.04s)]
*  have been calling from the beginning of freedom, freedom from inequality, freedom from the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=658.88s)]
*  occupation, freedom from the violence. And so it has been really difficult, I think, for me as I [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  walk on the House floor, walking there, watching many of the colleagues that voted for this, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=669.92s)]
*  not engage me. And they know I'm ready. I'm ready to have those conversations. And I think they're [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  missing an opportunity to talk to a Palestinian, a Palestinian-American serving with them. I have [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=679.6s)]
*  a lived experience that needs to be shared and be heard. I want to sort of stipulate here that I [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=685.52s)]
*  don't, I think the central resolution is a sort of ludicrous distraction amidst the sheer amount [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=691.12s)]
*  of human suffering happening in the region. So, you know, just to put that aside, but I do want [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=695.52s)]
*  to talk about this phrase, because obviously this was a phrase that I think really caught some folks, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=701.6s)]
*  I think Jewish Americans, supporters of Israel, different folks, and it reads differently to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=707.2s)]
*  different people from the river to the sea. The contention is that this is a call for a kind of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=711.12s)]
*  anti-colonial expulsion, right? Similar to like Algeria kicking out the French, right? Like, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  get out of here, go back to wherever you came from. This is how it's heard, I think, to a lot of Jewish [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=722.0s)]
*  years. And so I want you to explain like what you mean by it and why you used it or why you included [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  in the video. Yeah, I mean, look, I'm asking my colleagues, don't distort the words of my residents. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=733.36s)]
*  Many people in this movement for human rights for Palestinians have always centered around [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  coexistence. You hear them calling for that and saying that, you know, no matter your faith, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=742.88s)]
*  your ethnicity, your background, you should be able to live without fear, without discrimination, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=748.88s)]
*  without this kind of inequality that, you know, Netanyahu's extremist party and his leadership [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=753.6s)]
*  has been pushing. And so for many of my colleagues, they know and deep in their hearts where my heart [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  is and many of the folks, including the American Jewish community that's out there, demanding again [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=764.64s)]
*  the call again against this notion that we can't all live together. And so I think, again, this is [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=770.32s)]
*  just a moment right now that folks want to use this specific moment to silence the majority of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=778.24s)]
*  Americans that are calling for a ceasefire to silence this movement around actual peaceful [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=783.52s)]
*  coexistence. Because right now that's not what Netanyahu wants. Netanyahu's current government, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=788.24s)]
*  most extremist government in the history of Israel, is not calling for that. He's going to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=794.24s)]
*  United Nations and basically showing maps where Palestinians don't exist. And so I wish my [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=798.4s)]
*  colleagues would call out that. Just to be clear here, I mean, when you talk about peaceful [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  coexistence, you imagine a pluralistic democratic state in the full land from the river to the sea. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=808.24s)]
*  It was people called the one state solution. But that would be, I mean, fundamentally, the people [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=813.6s)]
*  that adhere to Zionism and think Israel should exist as a Jewish state, like they're just not [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=817.44s)]
*  going to like that. I'm not, I just want to clarify what the actual positions are. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=821.92s)]
*  Oh, I understand that. And you know, Chris, look, I grew up in the most beautiful blackest city in [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=825.12s)]
*  the country where separate but equal didn't work. We saw it in our own country, but I'm not going [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=827.84s)]
*  to push it on the people. If folks want to push for a two state, go for it. But guess what? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=832.32s)]
*  Guess what? Netanyahu's current government is not supporting that. He's literally said it to us over [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=836.48s)]
*  and over again. He doesn't want to coexist with Palestinians. And we're saying, no, we're going [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  to have a peaceful, a peaceful coexistence and pushing against those that want to target people [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  solely based on the fact they're Palestinian or a different faith. And again, that's what my city [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  that I grew up and taught me is to push against that kind of racism, that kind of discrimination, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  and that kind of, again, call for elimination. If I'll use the words he said, cleanse Gaza. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=862.08s)]
*  You know, this is what I have to continue to speak truth to power on. And I'm not going to allow, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=868.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to allow folks to distort or try to silence or again, try to make out that my [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=873.2800000000001s)]
*  residents are calling for something, anything, anything but the end to the violence. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=879.2s)]
*  You have worked assiduously on behalf of obviously you represent a community that has a lot of folks [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  that are from the Middle East and particularly Palestinian. You've worked assiduously on the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=889.36s)]
*  behalf of, I believe, two residents who were American residents who were trapped in Gaza. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=893.2s)]
*  I read an account today that talked about how much your efforts were instrumental in bringing them [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  home out of Gaza. Can you tell me a little bit about what that experience was like trying to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=904.16s)]
*  get to Americans to safety here back in the U.S.? I mean, Zechariah and Layla are finally home, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=908.08s)]
*  back home safely in Michigan, but it was an awful, horrific experience. They're Americans. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=914.16s)]
*  And what I saw from the State Department and Secretary Blinken's leadership is every single [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=919.92s)]
*  day that myself and many of my colleagues were asking, what is the plan to get Americans out [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=926.16s)]
*  of Gaza? There was no plan for days. And to me, that put the lives of Americans at risk. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=929.8399999999999s)]
*  And what I heard from Zechariah, who was sheltering after his family's home was bombed, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=935.92s)]
*  was sheltered in a hospital with his wife, is that he said it smelled like death, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=941.36s)]
*  that every single day he was worried that his life was going to be taken. He would leave me voice text, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=946.24s)]
*  Chris, just begging, urging, please tell them to get us out of here. Please tell them to stop. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=951.52s)]
*  Everything he saw was women and children coming into that hospital. They didn't have food. They [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=958.16s)]
*  didn't have electricity. He just had run out of his medication literally a few days before he was [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=962.16s)]
*  evacuated. And he just was in despair. I cannot express to you enough how hard it is as a member [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=966.64s)]
*  of Congress asking, again, our government to please, please help save the lives of Americans, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=974.16s)]
*  get them out. And again, they didn't move with the urgency that I was hoping. But he's home. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=979.76s)]
*  But one of the things you should know, Chris, is the overwhelming guilt that he's home safe [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=984.0s)]
*  and his family is still in Gaza right now being bombarded. And every day he worries that they're [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=988.8s)]
*  not going to be able to live through this. Congressman Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=995.04s)]
*  American member of Congress representing the city of Detroit, thank you so much for making time for [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=1000.64s)]
*  us tonight. Thank you. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=1003.92s)]
*  you [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTaToNsz_bw&t=1025.04s)]
