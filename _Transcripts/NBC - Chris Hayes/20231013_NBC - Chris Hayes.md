# ‘Dangerous prospect’ Dem rep rips GOP speaker nom Jordan as 'election denier'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE)
*  Summer Lee is a Democrat of Pennsylvania and she joins me now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman I wonder how this looks from the Democratic side of the aisle [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=4.84s)]
*  I mean you guys it's like I remember talking talking to friends of mine who are writers during the writer strike and they were like [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=7.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, we can't work and kind of want to but we're you guys are like in a weird enforced [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=12.52s)]
*  No work period until they figure this out, I guess [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=18.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's like pure chaos and it's honestly it's it's shameful and ridiculous at this point [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=23.28s)]
*  We come back in the midst of all that we have happening and we're sitting here since [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=29.2s)]
*  Tuesday night. We've not seen the house floor. We've not seen a committee room [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=35.04s)]
*  We've not passed a bill we're 35 days from another [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=39.76s)]
*  Budget crisis and we are doing this every day day in and day out [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=44.8s)]
*  So I think it reflects incredibly poorly on the Republican Conference on their leadership ability and honestly frankly from I think our perspective [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=48.84s)]
*  We recognize that there is no qualified candidate that they're able to produce anyways [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=56.92s)]
*  So we sit in the wings waiting with our own caucus ready to lead and ready to go [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=61.96s)]
*  Yeah, just the math here saw how Kapoor played this out earlier. They threw McCarthy overboard [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=67.16s)]
*  He had 210 votes in the house majority of the speaker then they picked Scalise who had 113 again internally he withdrew [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=71.92s)]
*  Now they not nominated Jordan who on the second vote got 124 the number to win is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  217 like they're still pretty far [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=83.72s)]
*  I guess [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  my question to you is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=88.8s)]
*  There is talk about there has been the case in some state houses [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=92.28s)]
*  Similar dysfunction in which Democrats have actually cut a deal with some faction of a Republican majority to elect a speaker [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=96.48s)]
*  Is that a discussion Democrats are having can you imagine a world in which that did happen? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=104.6s)]
*  You [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=108.68s)]
*  Know I can say that I've not been and no one who's who I've served in in caucus with are a part of those type [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=111.04s)]
*  Of discussions I would be really surprised if the Republicans would humble themselves in any way to accept the deal from the Democrats [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=118.44s)]
*  Right. We're a caucus of calm were the caucus that would prove to you know, this was their moment. They [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=125.08s)]
*  Regained the majority they were supposed to sail in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=131.96s)]
*  Cruise in and do everything that they wanted to do and it has been it has been an utter disaster from day one [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  So it would take a level of self-awareness [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  Close to Scalise stepping down but a little bit even more than that for them to accept [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=143.2s)]
*  You know Hawking Jeffries as a co-leader or anything close to that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=148.16s)]
*  Sheer power is is still within the realm. That's what we're pushing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  That's what I know progressives are making sure that we want them to recognize that we can have shared power agreements so that we can [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Unstall the government. That's what we want. We just want the government to work again and we want to be able to get a budget done [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=163.68s)]
*  Yeah, the shared power of you and I mean I saw people floating various, you know things [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=169.08s)]
*  I mean the thing to remember here is the caucus math is it from the house math? It's 217. That's a vote in the house [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=173.2s)]
*  That's a constitutional office. It's not a party vote. It's a vote in the house. You need to 17 [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=178.48s)]
*  I want to just play what Hawking Jeffries today had to say in response to to your colleague [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=183.08s)]
*  Jim Jordan being nominated by the internal Republican caucus for speaker before they all went home take a listen [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=187.96s)]
*  House Republicans [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=194.28s)]
*  Have just elected a speaker nominee [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=196.4s)]
*  Who in 16 years in this Congress hasn't passed a single bill? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=201.08s)]
*  Because his focus has not been on the American people [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=208.0s)]
*  his focus has been on peddling lies and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  conspiracy theories and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=217.2s)]
*  driving division [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=219.2s)]
*  Amongst the American people [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't think it's gonna happen [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  But I suppose it could is what are your thoughts on Jim Jordan as the United States Speaker of the house? I [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=226.04s)]
*  Think that it is a dangerous prospect [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that you know people make jokes and we we can laugh at the circus [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  We laugh at how kind of ridiculous it looks but at the end of the day, we're talking about people who? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  associate with anti-semites with white supremacists [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=243.16s)]
*  We're talking about people who deal and negotiate with them and have created relations. This is an election denier [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=245.88s)]
*  This is someone who asks for a pardon himself among the many dangerous things [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=252.72s)]
*  He's done [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=257.4s)]
*  So I think about the communities in our country who need a strong government and this would be the leader that we would send [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=257.76s)]
*  This is the leader that the Republican Party sends in this moment that we're that we're in someone who is friends of about white [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=263.0s)]
*  supremacists anti-semites [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=269.6s)]
*  And the like the David Duke with no baggage [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=271.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think it is a I think it's a really serious issue [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=274.16s)]
*  We have and I think that we really have to think of the implications of someone who has peddled in the extreme [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=276.92s)]
*  conspiracy theories he has someone who has put forth the extreme policy positions he has and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=282.12s)]
*  Someone who has created and maintained friendships with the extreme people that he has leading our caucus in our country [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  second and in line [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I should just note that Steve Scalise was one who once referred to himself as as David Duke without the baggage [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=297.28s)]
*  Not Jim Jordan. Just so folks who are at home or tracking Congresswoman Sumner Lee. Thank you. Thank you very much [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=302.88s)]
*  You [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTynBtQ6fiE&t=327.28s)]
