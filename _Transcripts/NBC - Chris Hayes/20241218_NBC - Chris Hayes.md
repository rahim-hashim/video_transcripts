# Liz Cheney slams ‘cowardly assault on the truth' after GOP targets her
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE)
*  If there's one thing Democrats and Donald Trump agreed on before the election, it was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=0.0s)]
*  that Trump wanted to weaponize the government against his political foes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=4.0s)]
*  We're already getting blue parent of how he might do that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=7.2s)]
*  Trump's toadies in the House just jinned up a criminal referral, basically spelling out [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=10.52s)]
*  how the FBI can use Trumped-up charges to go after one of MAGA's most vocal critics, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=14.66s)]
*  former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=19.64s)]
*  Trump received the message loud and clear, posting that Liz Cheney could be in a lot [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=22.48s)]
*  of trouble, effectively signaling that his choice for FBI Director Cash Patel, should [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=25.24s)]
*  he be confirmed, should target her come January. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=29.88s)]
*  Democrats labeled Trump a threat to democracy during the presidential campaign. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=34.64s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=37.64s)]
*  We were all here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=38.64s)]
*  We all saw it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=39.64s)]
*  Trump won the election anyway, and now he's, guess what, acting like a threat to democracy [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=40.64s)]
*  as they warned. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=44.16s)]
*  And what I would say is Democrats can't just plug their ears and pretend it isn't happening [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=45.54s)]
*  now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=49.72s)]
*  Trump's going to say something, right? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=50.72s)]
*  If Trump's FBI shows up at Liz Cheney's house to put her on a show trial, Sherrilyn Eiffel [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=53.26s)]
*  holds the Vernon Jordan Chair in Civil Rights at Howard University, where she's the founding [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=57.86s)]
*  director of the 14th Amendment Center for Law and Democracy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  She previously served as the president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  Fund, and she joins me now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=68.48s)]
*  Let's start on the explicitness here of these machinations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=71.97999999999999s)]
*  He pledged during the campaign. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=78.7s)]
*  on NBC. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=81.06s)]
*  He thinks these people should be in jail. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=82.06s)]
*  This was teed up by Republican allies in Congress. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=83.7s)]
*  Now he's, you know, he doesn't have to actually write a memo or call Cash Patel silently. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=86.9s)]
*  Like it's all there for all of us to see. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and he said in an interview that, you know, I'm not going to tell them to do it, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=94.06s)]
*  but I think they have to look into it, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  So we know what Trump's intentions are. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  And I think you hit the nail on the head earlier, Chris. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=104.42s)]
*  Trump has not ceased to be a threat to democracy because he won the election, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=108.34s)]
*  He is actually more of a threat. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's—I understand the difficulty that the Democrats are having figuring out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=115.26s)]
*  how to go forward and how to navigate this landscape. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=120.72s)]
*  It is difficult. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  But it is not going to be effectively navigated by pretending that Trump won an election and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=125.38s)]
*  now we all come together and make things happen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=131.58s)]
*  It also won't work to pretend as though this is Trump's first term. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=134.74s)]
*  Too much has happened since Trump's first term. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=138.9s)]
*  January 6th happened. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  The January 6th hearings happened. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  But most importantly, the Supreme Court happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=145.36s)]
*  And the Supreme Court told the country and told Donald Trump that nothing that he does [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=147.8s)]
*  while he is president, except for the most extreme activities on the outer edges of his [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=153.3s)]
*  executive power, can be criminally prosecuted. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=159.82000000000002s)]
*  And most importantly and most frighteningly, they suggested that even anything he does [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=164.34s)]
*  with the Department of Justice, that he is essentially over the Department of Justice [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=169.82s)]
*  in very explicit ways. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=175.78s)]
*  And Trump understands now that he has full authority and power, that he won't be held [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=177.94s)]
*  accountable, and where there is impunity, there will be excess. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=183.14s)]
*  And the question is, how are the Democrats going to deal with this? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=187.66s)]
*  How are they going to talk about it, and how are they going to deal with it? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=190.42s)]
*  Yeah, one thing that's been interesting is there's this debate happening about how much [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=193.38000000000002s)]
*  to—how to deal with Trump, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=197.86s)]
*  And it's a debate in some ways that contorts familiar to other debates I've seen after [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=200.3s)]
*  George W. Bush won in 2000. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  Famously, Ted Kennedy worked with him on his signature piece of legislation, which was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=206.46s)]
*  the No Child Left Behind Act, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=210.66000000000003s)]
*  So they thought, okay, well, he won. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=212.22000000000003s)]
*  We're going to meet him halfway. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=214.18s)]
*  Mitch McConnell took an opposite tack when Barack Obama was elected, right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=215.9s)]
*  We're going to resist. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=219.46s)]
*  What's striking to me is that all of that is on one axis, like, oh, what should we do [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=222.42s)]
*  about the bills? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=225.7s)]
*  Then there's like, well, what are you going to do when he starts prosecuting people? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=226.7s)]
*  Like, they're just on different axes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=229.5s)]
*  And whatever conversation is happening here feels, like, removed from this one, if that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=231.98s)]
*  makes sense. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, in a way, I think what the Democrats should be doing is, on the bills, they should [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  be talking directly with their counterparts, which are the Republicans in the House and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=243.42s)]
*  the Senate. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=247.98s)]
*  That's who they should be engaging with. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=248.98s)]
*  That's who they should be calling out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=250.62s)]
*  That's who they should be exposing and demanding that they do their job. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=251.98s)]
*  That's who they should be telling and telling the American people how embarrassing it is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  that these people have allowed one random billionaire to essentially take over their [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=259.66s)]
*  job, that they have allowed the president to take over the historic role of Congress [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=264.42s)]
*  in a system of checks and balances. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=269.74s)]
*  No one's explaining that to the American people, that having the president call and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=271.98s)]
*  say kill this bill is a problem, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=275.42s)]
*  So they need to be doing that first and foremost. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=278.98s)]
*  That's what they should be doing on the bills. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=281.38s)]
*  The other overarching piece is kind of their meat and potatoes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=283.14s)]
*  Let's remember the words of Ruby Freeman. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=288.06s)]
*  Do you know what it's like to be targeted by the president of the United States? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=291.06s)]
*  I don't presume that because Liz Cheney is wealthy and a conservative and from a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=295.3s)]
*  conservative old line family, that it is not also troubling to her to be targeted by the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=306.26s)]
*  This is very serious. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  And obviously, ABC News thought that there was a problem being targeted by the president [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  of the United States as well. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  So this is very serious. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=315.17999999999995s)]
*  And Trump is going to unleash what he said he was going to unleash. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=317.05999999999995s)]
*  He is not satisfied by winning. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=320.85999999999996s)]
*  That is not what satisfies him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  He needs to know that his critics are frightened of him. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=325.02s)]
*  And so nothing that you say now, we're willing to work with him and all of these nice [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=329.61999999999995s)]
*  statements that you could make about George W. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  Bush and you could find policy practices that you agree with. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=336.58000000000004s)]
*  Trump wants to close the Department of Education. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  Trump wants to weaponize the the the Justice Department. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=342.58000000000004s)]
*  Trump wants to fire black generals and others who support diversity in the from the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  Department of Defense. These are not things that you can work with him on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=352.62s)]
*  So Trump is who Trump is. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  And in addition to the things that he believes, he's also incredibly vindictive and he [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=358.5s)]
*  now has the power to carry forth his appetite for vengeance. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=362.34s)]
*  And the Democrats need to array themselves as the protectors of the American people, as [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=366.73999999999995s)]
*  the people who are explaining to the country that this danger exists and who are vowing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  to do everything in their power to protect ordinary people, whether they are journalists, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  whether they are ordinary election workers, whether they are people who criticize the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=381.5s)]
*  president in their writing or in their speeches, that they are going to protect our [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=386.26s)]
*  democracy by ensuring that we still live in a country where the citizens have the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=390.82s)]
*  right to criticize those in power. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  And I'm not hearing any leaders in the Democratic Party speak to that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm hearing them talk about, you know, the continuing resolution, which is incredibly [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=402.02s)]
*  important. But that's about exposing Mike Johnson as being the feckless, ineffective, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  quote unquote, leader that he is. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=412.34s)]
*  I think it's a it's a wonderful opportunity to expose him and to expose the Republicans [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=414.02s)]
*  and to expose the danger of having a billionaire, a capricious billionaire who actually knows [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=419.06s)]
*  very little about how the government works, come in and put his thumb on the scale. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cztB6uczE&t=424.62s)]
